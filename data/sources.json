The mother of two girls herself, in 2013 she wrote the following letter to one of her daughters, explaining at the time:\n\nMy daughter is about to turn 13 and I’ve been smoking a lot recently, and so – in the wee small hours, when my lungs feel like there’s a small mouse inside them, scratching to get out – I’ve thought about writing her one of those “Now I’m Dead, Here’s My Letter Of Advice For You To Consult As You Continue Your Now Motherless Life” letters. Here’s the first draft. Might tweak it a bit later. When I’ve had another fag.\n\nIn 2020, Caitlin very kindly allowed me to include this letter in my book, Letters of Note: Mothers . And then, because I’m incredibly lucky, the late Helen McCrory agreed to read it for the audiobook .\n\nHello, it’s Mummy. Look – here are a couple of things I’ve learnt on the way that you might find useful in the coming years. It’s not an exhaustive list, but it’s a good start. Also, I’ve left you loads of life-insurance money – so go hog wild on eBay on those second-hand vintage dresses you like. You have always looked beautiful in them. You have always looked beautiful.\n\nThe main thing is just try to be nice. You already are – so lovely I burst, darling – and so I want you to hang on to that and never let it go. Keep slowly turning it up, like a dimmer switch, whenever you can. Just resolve to shine, constantly and steadily, like a warm lamp in the corner, and people will want to move towards you in order to feel happy, and to read things more clearly. You will be bright and constant in a world of dark and flux, and this will save you the anxiety of other, ultimately less satisfying things like ‘being cool’, ‘being more successful than everyone else’ and ‘being very thin’.\n\nSecond, always remember that, nine times out of ten, you probably aren’t having a full-on nervous breakdown – you just need a cup of tea and a biscuit. You’d be amazed how easily and repeatedly you can confuse the two. Get a big biscuit tin.\n\nThree – always pick up worms off the pavement and put them on the grass. They’re having a bad day, and they’re good for… the earth or something (ask Daddy more about this; am a bit sketchy).\n\nFour: choose your friends because you feel most like yourself around them, because the jokes are easy and you feel like you’re in your best outfit when you’re with them, even though you’re just in a T-shirt. Never love someone whom you think you need to mend – or who makes you feel like you should be mended. There are boys out there who look for shining girls; they will stand next to you and say quiet things in your ear that only you can hear and that will slowly drain the joy out of your heart. The books about vampires are true, baby. Drive a stake through their hearts and run away.\n\nStay at peace with your body. While it’s healthy, never think of it as a problem or a failure. Pat your legs occasionally and thank them for being able to run. Put your hands on your belly and enjoy how soft and warm you are – marvel over the world turning over within, the brilliant meat clockwork, as I did when you were inside me and I dreamt of you every night.\n\nWhenever you can’t think of something to say in a conversation, ask people questions instead. Even if you’re next to a man who collects pre-Seventies screws and bolts, you will probably never have another opportunity to find out so much about pre-Seventies screws and bolts, and you never know when it will be useful.\n\nThis segues into the next tip: life divides into AMAZING ENJOYABLE TIMES and APPALLING EXPERIENCES THAT WILL MAKE FUTURE AMAZING ANECDOTES. However awful, you can get through any experience if you imagine yourself, in the future, telling your friends about it as they scream, with increasing disbelief, ‘NO! NO!’ Even when Jesus was on the cross, I bet He was thinking, ‘When I rise in three days, the disciples aren’t going to believe this when I tell them about it.’\n\nBabyiest, see as many sunrises and sunsets as you can. Run across roads to smell fat roses. Always believe you can change the world – even if it’s only a tiny bit, because every tiny bit needed someone who changed it. Think of yourself as a silver rocket – use loud music as your fuel; books like maps and co-ordinates for how to get there. Host extravagantly, love constantly, dance in comfortable shoes, talk to Daddy and Nancy about me every day and never, ever start smoking. It’s like buying a fun baby dragon that will grow and eventually burn down your f***ing house.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

My mother, rest her merry, brainy soul, convinced me early on that I was - as she liked to put it, quoting the cartoon character Yogi Bear - \"SMARRR-ter than the average bear!\"\n\nI happily assumed that my Yogi-like intelligence would ensure great things. My sense of entitlement grew when I easily won good marks in school, then grew some more when three different college professors told me I had a talent for writing. Rising to the top, I gathered, was a matter of natural buoyancy. The reality check came in my twenties, when nearly a decade of middling effort failed to cast the glow of my writing genius much beyond my study walls.\n\nBy my early thirties I saw the obvious: my smarts and \"talent\" - above average or not - would count for little unless I outworked most of the other writers. Only when I started putting in some extra hours did I get anywhere. About the time I had my epiphany, a growing field of scholarship was more rigorously reaching the same conclusion. It seems the ability we're so fond of calling talent or even genius arises not from innate gifts but from an interplay of fair (but not extraordinary) natural ability, quality instruction, and a mountain of work.\n\nThis new discipline - a mix of psychology and cognitive science - has now produced its first large collection of expert reviews, the massive Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance . The book essentially tells us to forget the notion that \"genius\", \"talent\" or any other innate qualities create the greats we call geniuses.\n\nInstead, as the American inventor Thomas Edison said, genius is 99 per cent perspiration - or, to be truer to the data, perhaps 1 per cent inspiration, 29 per cent good instruction and encouragement, and 70 per cent perspiration.\n\nExamine closely even the most extreme examples - Mozart, Newton, Einstein, Stravinsky - and you find more hard-won mastery than gift. Geniuses are made, not born. Extraordinary efforts \"It's complicated explaining how genius or expertise is created and why it's so rare,\" says Anders Ericsson, the professor of psychology at Florida State University in Tallahassee who edited the handbook.\n\n\"But it isn't magic, and it isn't born. It happens because some critical things line up so that a person of good intelligence can put in the sustained, focused effort it takes to achieve extraordinary mastery.\n\n\"These people don't necessarily have an especially high IQ, but they almost always have very supportive environments, and they almost always have important mentors. And the one thing they always have is this incredible investment of effort.\" This is mixed news, says Ericsson. \"It's funny, really. On one hand it's encouraging: it makes me think that even the most ordinary among us should be careful about saying we can't do great things, because people have proven again and again that most people can do something extraordinary if they're willing to put in the exercise.\n\n\"On the other hand, it's a bit overwhelming to look at what these people have to do. They generally invest about five times as much time and effort to become great as an accomplished amateur does to become competent. It's not something everyone's up for.\" Studies of extraordinary performance run a wide gamut, employing memory tests, IQ comparisons, brain scans, retrospective interviews of high achievers and longitudinal studies of people who were identified in their youth as highly gifted.\n\nNone bears out the myth of inherent genius. Take intelligence. No accepted measure of innate or basic intelligence, whether IQ or other metrics, reliably predicts that a person will develop extraordinary ability.\n\nIn other words, the IQs of the great would not predict their level of accomplishments, nor would their accomplishments predict their IQs.\n\nStudies of chess masters and highly successful artists, scientists and musicians usually find their IQs to be above average, typically in the 115 to 130 range, where some 14 per cent of the population reside - impressive enough, but hardly as rarefied as their achievements and abilities. The converse - that high IQ does not ensure greatness - holds as well. This was shown in a study of adult graduates of New York City's Hunter College Elementary School, where an admission criterion was an IQ of at least 130 (achieved by a little over 1 per cent of the general population) and the mean IQ was 157 - \"genius\" territory by any scaling of IQ scores, and a level reached by perhaps 1 in 5000 people.\n\nThough the Hunter graduates were successful and reasonably content with their lives, they had not reached the heights of accomplishment, either individually or as a group, that their IQs might have suggested. In the words of study leader Rena Subotnik, a research psychologist formerly at the City University of New York and now with the American Psychological Association: \"There were no superstars, no Pulitzer Prize or MacArthur Award winners, and only one or two familiar names.\"\n\nThe genius these elite students showed in their IQs remained on paper. So what does create genius or extreme talent? Musicians have an old joke about this: How do you get to Carnegie Hall from here? Practise.\n\nA sober look at any field shows that the top performers are rarely more gifted than the also-rans, but they almost invariably outwork them. This doesn't mean that some people aren't more athletic or smarter than others.\n\nThe elite are elite partly because they have some genetic gifts - for learning and hand-eye coordination, for instance - but the very best rise because they take great pains to maximise that gift. Take Stephen Hawking, who likes to dismiss questions about his IQ by saying, \"People who boast about their IQ are losers,\" and was a middling student and achiever until his mid-twenties.\n\nOnly then did he catch fire - and begin working obsessively - while collaborating with fellow physicist Roger Penrose on black-hole theory. Pete Sampras didn't possess more talent than Andre Agassi, but he won 14 grand slams to Agassi's eight because he worked harder and more steadily.

Peering into the Paracosm - Reboot","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/paracosm?s=w","content":"A few months ago, Reboot community member Maggie Pan organized a book club around Stories of Your Life and Others , a collection of short science fiction stories by Ted Chiang.\n\nIn today’s guest essay, Maggie reflects not only on her philosophical takeaways, but also on the value of working through these questions with a community of peers. She notes that “Surprisingly, we barely talked about the stories themselves; instead, our discussions were filled with debates on free will, moral obligation, careers and motivations, and countless what ifs.”\n\nOften, I attribute my childhood to a time of novelty and excitement; now, the present feels ridden with routine. But in the worlds created and restructured by science fiction authors, I feel escape from this mundanity. I take their words and peer into these paracosms — these strange but somehow familiar worlds.\n\nScience fiction models the phenomenological reality we know. Of course, the extent of this relation varies: in Division by Zero, the world is exactly the same as ours and its characters are ordinarily human; in Hell is the Absence of God, the world includes visits by angels, miracles, and souls that can be seen transcending into Heaven or falling into Hell. If we play along, we can see glimpses of our own society at the foundations of this fictional world. In Seventy-Two Letters, political practices and social elitism mean that science and technology are developed primarily by the rich for the rich (and to the detriment of the lower class) — a familiar mirror to the problems in our world.\n\nScience fiction doesn’t just model the world: it models ourselves as well. Regardless of setting, characters’ behaviors, worries, and motivations are realistic and human-like, giving rise to propositions about the essence of humanity. For example, we often chase power in the form of knowledge. In Tower of Babylon, humanity comes together to construct a tower to reach the Vault of Heaven, motivated by pride as well as a curiosity for some divine truth: ”a stair that men might ascend to see the works of Yahweh and that and that Yahweh might descend to see the works of men.” In Understand, Leon uses his superintelligence, motivated by self-enlightenment and aesthetic, to uncover the “ultimate gestalt: the context in which all knowledge fits and is illuminated, a mandala, the music of spheres, kosmos.”\n\nThe power of reading a science fiction collection lies in seeing these themes manifest in different ways, through different characters and situations, over and over again. Discovering these patterns independently and through discussions makes these themes more salient, memorable, and truthful than just being told a summary. Without reading, exogenous ideas remain loose and abstract; they float around and eventually dissipate into oblivion. Reading grounds philosophical ideas in concrete narratives; having an endogenous source embeds these ideas in the mind, rendering them timeless.\n\nWhile science fiction depicts a version of the world we know, it also contains elements — physical appearances, behaviors, situations, social structures, and more — that are foreign to us. These strange additions, alterations, and subtractions show us what we take for granted while making us question what is “normal.\"\n\nThe Evolution of Human Science presents a future where a new branch of superintelligent “metahumans” emerges from human evolution. These metahumans make their research findings available only through “digital neural transfer” (DNT), which is incomprehensible to ordinary humans who are forced to shift their research focus to “hermeneutics: interpreting the scientific work of metahumans” instead. Metahumans and DNT raises critical questions: who gets to benefit from new technology, and who are we leaving behind? Personally, these are the questions I wonder when thinking about tech literacy for the older generation (because of the invention of phones, computers, etc.) and our current generation (someone motivate me to learn about cryptocurrency).\n\nIn Story of Your Life, when aliens come to earth, linguist Dr. Louise Banks learns the aliens' semasiographic language to communicate and exchange ideas. Our book club’s discussion centered on the role of language and free will: how has language shaped our perception of the world, and how do we understand the role of free will in our own life? Some noted that choices are made by a mixture of uncontrollable factors (e.g. temperament, time pressure, social atmosphere), while others acknowledged this, yet wanted to believe in free will because it enabled active, emotional participation in the present. We decided that the illusion of free will — the feeling of agency — is important regardless of its existence: to quote a book club member, “your belief in something existing makes it exist, whether or not it actually does.”\n\nDespite being rooted in our world, science fiction ultimately provides a temporal and a positional buffer: it introduces a future that we can analyze as a third-party observer.\n\nUnderstand showcases the gradual development of superintelligence from hormone K therapy, and Liking What You See: A Documentary outlines personal experiences and debates of “calli,” a medical procedure that induces visual agnosia of beauty. These futuristic technologies allow us to comfortably label that world as “not our own.\" However, the resemblance to our world is unshakeable. In reading Understand and Liking What You See, we discussed the limits of intelligence, analyzed the contrast between aesthetic/theory versus functionality/application, saw parallels between calliagnosia and digital touch-ups, and shared the effects of the concept of beauty in our personal lives.\n\nThe truth hurts, but not so much when we still feel far removed; we can protect our egos when we criticize these fictional mirrors. We can reflect on the story's trajectory, then project those same questions onto ourselves: If I were in this situation, what would I do? These hypotheticals push us to our moral limits: What are my moral boundaries? My values for life, a relationship, a career? What would I do, and why?\n\nTo this point, I've portrayed science fiction stories as simply hypothesis tests that can motivate preventative or reactive actions. But science fiction is also generative: a source of inspiration and motivation. In reading Tower of Babylon, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and hope. I was in awe at the unification of humanity, inspired by their grand mission to reach the vault of heaven, curious to find what was on the other side. I cried during the poignant and heart-wrenching Story of Your Life, and felt angry and fearful reading Seventy-Two Letters.\n\nScience fiction makes us feel more human. It may give us warning and glimpses of unwanted dystopias, but it also inspires us and reminds us of our humanity — our connection to those around us. It provides us with technological inspiration that can become reality (the International Space Station, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality), while telling us to be more aware of what we create, decide, and use.\n\nScience fiction doesn't give us solutions, but it encourages both internal and external reflection. It gives us a path to becoming more introspective, more caring, more inspired, and more optimistic. It gives us an idea of a better world we would want to live in and work toward.\n\nMaggie Pan (she/her) is a psychology student at Duke, where she is an undergraduate researcher at the ECC Lab , thinking about imagination, free will, and robots. She is an incoming product design intern at Hellosaurus and loves baking, Russian literature, and autumn.\n\nIf you had to pick a favorite story in the collection, what would it be and why?\n\nTower of Babylon is especially close to my heart because it was the first Ted Chiang story I read! I was so impressed with how clever and intricate the plot and world-building were. It’s a brilliant, awe-inspiring, albeit somewhat disturbing story with themes of limits, pride, the pursuit of truth, and curiosity of the unknown.\n\nWhat is speculative design? How does science/speculative fiction shape your practice as a designer?\n\nSpeculative design uses imagination and thought experiments to prompt us to think about the impacts of a product or technology. The idea is to answer the 'should’ before the ‘how.’ Instead of “How might we…?” questions, we can ask “What if…?” questions.\n\nSpeculative design is closely tied to science fiction because it helps us simulate possible futures, criticize their risks, and make adjustments in the present — choosing to delete or refine a concept — to guide our technological and societal trajectories. For example, Frankenstein is a clear demonstration of why we should consider the impacts of what we put out into the world.\n\nIn practice, I’ve become a lot more careful in the earlier parts of the design process, like ideation. I start by reading up on existing research (e.g. previous design studies, psychology research papers) before designing concept boards, which are then presented to others.\n\nWhat else should we be reading?\n\nIn addition to Stories of Your Life and Others , I highly, highly recommend Ted Chiang’s second short story collection Exhalation . For some longer reads, I recommend my two all-time favorite books that just so happen to be science fiction: the Strugatsky brothers’ Roadside Picnic and Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five .\n\nReboot community member Nancy Zuo reflects on what playing MMORPGs taught her about scarcity and capitalism .\n\nPeople are now building tech tools for union organizers, and some of these initiatives are… venture-backed ?

on tech journalism, ethical career paths, and the search for values alignment across the board.\n\nKaren is the senior AI editor at the MIT Technology Review. She’s also an MIT Knight Science Journalism Fellow, wrote the newsletter The Algorithm , and co-produced the award-winning podcast In Machines We Trust . Prior to the Tech Review, she was a data scientist, an application engineer at the first startup to spin out of Alphabet’s X, and received her BS in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Energy Studies from MIT.\n\nKaren’s commitment to rigor, empathy, and curiosity is reflected both in her approach to reporting as well as to her thinking on ethical tech careers. She also offers a peek behind the curtain at the impactful yet often controversial work of tech journalism, and includes advice for aspiring journalists and technologists alike.\n\nThis event was facilitated by Reboot community member Archana Ahlawat for Reboot’s private community. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWelcome Karen, and thank you for being here! To start with, how did you begin your career path in tech?\n\nAfter college, I moved to San Francisco to work at startups. I was obsessed with how we could fight climate change, which is obviously a very long and laborious process, but I didn't see the venture capital model being the right vehicle for tackling longer term issues.\n\nI was at a company called flux.io, the first startup to spin out of Google X. Flux was trying to use technology to incentivize more sustainable architecture and urban development, so I thought it was the perfect alignment of technology with a problem that I wanted to solve. But Flux failed spectacularly. If you go on Google X’s website, it's scrubbed from ever existing. When it failed, it made me take a step back and think, Is the tech industry the right place for me?\n\nI had no idea what to do next. I thought, If I'm not going to be in the tech industry, what are spaces that are not as driven by a for-profit model? It came down to government, nonprofits, or journalism. But I didn't have a background in any of those worlds because I had been so focused on getting into the tech industry for so long.\n\nHow did you navigate your transition from engineering to journalism?\n\nI first started exploring journalism because I love writing and it was something that I'd always been curious about.\n\nIn the Bay Area, there are two strong journalism schools, one at Stanford and one at UC Berkeley. I took day trips to each of them, sat in on classes, and talked with students there about what it means to be a journalist and how I could marry what I want to do with a career in this world.\n\nAnd I just really fell in love with journalism. I loved the classes, I loved speaking with the students, I loved the way they were thinking about their role in society, and I was excited about being able to work for mission-driven organizations. In journalism, there is obviously a looming need to make money, but as a journalist, you're split from that. There's a strong divide between the business side and the editorial side.\n\nI didn't know any other journalists, so I went to the MIT alumni database and searched for every person that had ever done journalism. There were around 50 people in a span of 70 years, so I reached out to all of them. Maybe 15 people responded, so I got on calls to ask how they made the transition from studying engineering.\n\nTwo paths emerged. You either go to grad school or you keep writing, publishing, and trying to get an internship until you make it. I was like, Great, I don't have money to go to grad school, so I'll just write until I make it. I learned to write an article in an edX class, shopped that one article around, landed an unpaid internship, went from there to a fellowship, went from there to a staff job, and that's how I made my transition.\n\n“I’m not afraid of reading technical papers or talking to startup founders or engineers about how their technology works. So I started differentiating myself by digging into my technical background.”\n\nHow did you figure out the unique perspective you bring to writing about the tech industry?\n\nI originally wanted to be an environmental reporter, so my first unpaid internship was at the Sierra Club magazine.\n\nBut people don't hire environmental reporters. In 2016, everyone wanted tech reporters. It was when the techlash was starting, and there was a lot of interest in the tech industry, its culture, and new technologies like AI. Because of my resume, whenever I applied for jobs, they would ask me, “Do you want to be on the tech desk?”\n\nI took my first tech writing job pretty begrudgingly, but realized that I could make this into a strength. I’m not afraid of reading technical papers or talking to startup founders or engineers about how their technology works. So I started differentiating myself by digging into my technical background. Also, the reality of journalism is that you have to draw upon your network, and mine was in tech, so it was a lot faster for me to identify who I needed to talk to and get conversations.\n\nBut as I continued reporting, I realized that there was also a fundamental misunderstanding of the culture in the tech industry. Some of the smartest and kindest people I know work in tech. They have amazing intentions and then work for companies that do not benefit society in the ways that they espouse. I was fascinated by what was going wrong in this process. For people who haven’t been close to those who work in tech, there's a perception: What are these people doing? Why is this stuff always messed up? Maybe it's not about the people, it's about the systems that they're in.\n\nI also started thinking, What do I need to tell my friends in the tech industry about the world outside? A lot of people in tech get really insular. You're living in San Francisco, interacting with other tech people, and don't think about other perspectives. I wanted to write stories that help people who might be drinking the Kool Aid realize that there's other things they should be considering when they're building technology. I wanted more bridge-building and conversations on both sides of the aisle.\n\nIt does seem like there are fewer such gaps in tech reporting now — many journalists have a more holistic grasp of the industry. Where do you see that there's still work to be done?\n\nThere are a lot of parallels with the tech industry. In tech, we're seeing younger technologists question whether technology is truly neutral, like there's bias that's embedded within these technologies.\n\nIn journalism, the same transition happened. Old school journalists considered themselves to be very objective. They would act like they don't have a position.\n\nI’d consider myself as part of a younger generation of journalists throwing that out the window. There's an argument behind the things that I write — I'm always very clear about what my position is. I don't think that I'm neutral, and I don't think that I should pretend that I am. But I strive to be fair and honor a multiplicity of perspectives.\n\n“I try very much to respect the people I talk to, even if I'm critiquing the systems or the company that they're part of.”\n\nThere's a lot of PR and narrative-building coming from the tech industry, yet you also seem to have a strong sense of what's going on within the academic sphere. How do you manage that?\n\nIt's really just a race to keep on top of all the AI research that comes out.\n\nWhen I started covering AI, I would read five or ten papers a week, then get on calls with researchers at the forefront of their fields. Once I was able to build a core understanding of AI’s limitations and capabilities, it was easy to see a startup saying “We're going to solve AGI in two years” and think, That's an interesting claim that most of the research community does not agree with.\n\nOver the years, I’ve developed a lot of good friendships with AI researchers, so I'm always checking in to ask: What's new? What do I need to know about? How are things shifting? All the best tech reporters do that. They stay close to the research and have their own understanding of it before they start talking with companies or PR people that have the financial incentive to aggrandize what they're working on.\n\nIt can be exhausting. There were times when I would go on vacation for a week and feel like I missed an entire shift of the industry.\n\nHow do you maintain relationships with the tech industry despite some of their skepticism of the media?\n\nWhen I write something that brings PR jargon down to reality, I've never had someone get upset. They respect that my articles are technically grounded. Sometimes, in a call with a company representative, I'll ask about the technical details and it’ll catch them off guard — I understand more than they thought I did. Then, they’ll tell me a bit more about the honest capabilities of their system, and that's how I gain respect and trust with those individuals.\n\nIn cases where I've had a more contentious story-writing process, most recently with Facebook, I try very much to respect the people, even if I'm critiquing the systems or the company that they're part of. It's a hard balance to strike. I don't know that I always do it correctly, but at the end of the day, I still feel comfortable calling up the individual that I spoke to and feeling like I honored them as a person. Even if I am very harsh on the things they did, I try to be clear that their actions don't necessarily make them evil or bad.\n\nHow do you research questions that require access to corporate data?\n\nI try to be realistic about what I have access to at the start of a story. I wrote a piece about how Facebook Instant Articles is funding misinformation in the Global South, and that was based on open source data and the CrowdTangle API. I scoped the story based on exactly what I knew was in CrowdTangle.\n\nSo one limitation of reporting on companies from the outside is that you have to work with what you're given.\n\nHow do you sift through everything going on in the tech industry to choose what to focus on?\n\nSomething that really surprised me when I came into journalism was how subjective everything is. It’s just based on what I'm interested in. I spend a lot of my time absorbing information, having calls, reading papers, looking at the news, and just keeping a pulse on conversations. When things grab my attention, I’ll start to chase.\n\nI always try to think back to my ultimate goal. I gravitate towards stories that reveal how tech culture shapes technology and how technology impacts people. I also consider: If I didn't write the story, would someone else be able to? Is there a particular thing I have that would help me write the story in a way I think is valuable, whether that's access to particular people or the technical ability to explain a complicated concept?\n\n“There's an argument behind the things that I write — I'm always very clear about what my position is. I don't think that I'm neutral, and I don't think that I should pretend that I am. But I strive to be fair.”\n\nHow do you think the training of engineers impacts the culture of the tech industry?\n\nOne of the most obvious things in my undergrad was that I never had to take a single ethics class. At MIT, we had a humanities and social sciences requirement, but the culture within the student body was that these classes were a joke. That directly feeds into some of the challenges we see in the tech industry where people don't value certain types of expertise that are core to building technologies that are better for humanity.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me when I was at MIT was the career fairs. It was this huge thing with hundreds of companies. You're trying to figure out how to make a career after four grueling years of education: what's going to pay you, what other people see as exciting and prestigious. When you walk into the fair, tech companies like Snapchat have the largest crowds. There were never any social impact companies or opportunities, so you just assume that they don't exist.\n\nIf I knew then that you could be a tech-interested person not directly in the Silicon Valley startup industry, I might have tried a whole assortment of other things. But they don't show up in these signaling venues, so students don't think about those opportunities.\n\nDo you think if you had graduated at this time, you would find more values alignment in the tech industry?\n\nNo, I don’t think so. I have friends who are excited about using data science for social impact, but also really want to do technically challenging work. There's only so many companies that you can do that at, so they move from like Facebook to Twitter to whatever, and ultimately, those aren't companies I think I would want to stay at.\n\nInstead of journalism, I probably would have ended up at a research institute or think tank at the intersection of tech and policy — things I didn't know existed in college. Maybe I would have stayed, or who knows, maybe I would have become a journalist anyway.\n\nFor more perspectives on the social impact of journalism (and people who read more than I ever will), listen to Ezra Klein’s conversation with the 80,000 Hours podcast .\n\nWorried about catching Omicron?

And of those seven, four dropped out of Stanford University.\n\nThe world's youngest self-made billionaires all built their fortunes by founding startups. All but two individuals are US citizens. They are collectively worth $16.1 billion, reported Forbes.\n\nBrazilian-born corporate credit-card startup founders Pedro Franceschi, 25, and Henrique Dubugras, 26, are the world's youngest self-made billionaires named in Forbes' list this year. The pair founded Brex in 2017 after quitting Stanford eight months into their freshman year. Franceschi and Dubugras are worth an estimated $1.5 billion each, per Forbes.\n\nAnother Stanford dropout, Ryan Breslow, founded payment-software company Bolt in 2014, when he was a college sophomore, per Bloomberg. This is the first time the 27-year-old Miami native, whose net worth is pegged at $2 billion, has been named to the Forbes Billionaires List.\n\nSensor-tech entrepreneur Austin Russell founded Luminar when he was an undergrad, according to Forbes. Russell, who is now worth $1.6 billion, dropped out of Stanford in 2012 after getting a $100,000 fellowship from PayPal magnate Peter Thiel.\n\nTwo Stanford alumni also made this year's list of self-made billionaires under 30. Food-delivery app cofounders Stanley Tang and Andy Fang , both 29, graduated from the university in 2014, their LinkedIn profiles show. The pair founded DoorDash in 2013. Tang and Fang are worth $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion respectively, per Forbes.\n\nRounding out the list of self-made billionaires under the age of 30 is cryptocurrency tech mogul Gary Wang, who is worth $5.9 billion. The 28-year-old cofounded Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange FTX with fellow billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried in 2019.\n\nStanford University is located in Stanford, California, just a few miles from Palo Alto. The university, which is widely regarded as one of the most prestigious in the world, accepted less than 4% of 55,471 applicants for the class of 2025, according to its website. The university's tuition in the most recent academic year cost $57,693.\n\nForbes launched its annual Billionaires List in 1987. This is the magazine's 36th edition of the list. The list famously generated a wave of controversy when it named Kylie Jenner — of Kardashian family fame and wealth — the world's youngest self-made billionaire in 2019.\n\nSign up for notifications from Insider!

We are all always at the foot. The speed of light is the foot of a mountain; the three dimensions of space are a foot of a mountain. You are imprisoned in the deep gorge of light-speed and three-dimensional space. Does it not feel… cramped?\n\n– Liu Cixin, Mountain\n\n\nIf you have a deadline a week from now, there is always some impending sense of dread.\nWere you to sleep through an alarm, or stay out late with friends, those are hours wasted. Time is working against you, and every hour you don’t make progress is an hour you’ll never retrieve. In fact, even if you do make progress, if it’s not at the pace required to achieve your goals within the allotted time, you are still falling behind.\nFor many of us, this is the norm, and has been our entire lives. Not even our adult lives, but since infancy. I was taking timed tests in elementary school, trying to finish homework before my bedtime in middle school, writing essays up until the last minute in high school… It’s not that I’m a chronic procrastinator, it’s that time is chronically catching up with me.\nThis is the norm, but it doesn’t have to be. Consider putting your money in a high-yield savings account. As you sleep, you are earning money. Were you to sleep in an extra hour, that would not be an hour wasted, but an hour to accrue more compound interest. Were you, like Fry from Futurama, to fall into a coma for 1,000 years, you could wake up a billionaire. Time is working for you.\nFinance is the most obvious example, but it’s not an isolated case. Lots of things grow and compound, far beyond the effort you put into them. If you plant an apple tree today, you’ll be greeted years from now with a bountiful harvest. If you have children today, you’ll be greeted decades from now with beautiful grandkids. And as it turns out, if you start a blog, you can stop writing posts for months at a time and subscribers will still trickle in on the legacy of past writing.\nTime is on your side.\nThis isn’t just a convenient growth hack, it’s the only way to tolerate this otherwise miserable human condition. If you are not investing, which is to say, if you do not have plants growing, kombucha brewing, relationships maturing, and so forth, what are you doing other than dying?\nWithout time working for you, all that awaits is slow decay. If not through your own personal demise, then through thermodynamic entropy. Making time work for you is a kind of dark magic, a way to resist death even as it threatens to swallow you whole.\n\nAnd as with all dark magic, it imposes serious costs.\nSay you’re on an airplane, 9 hours left on a trans-pacific flight, ravioli in its tin tray, blockbuster on the seat-back screen. There’s nothing to do but wait. And why not? After all, time is on your side. Each passing hour brings you closer to your destination, closer to home, closer to the moment when you can get off this plane and really start living again.\nBut what happens next? Now you land, and you’re standing in the aisle, waiting to deplane, then you’re at the App Pickup Zone waiting for your Uber, and then in the Uber once again in some state of sleep-deprived half-death waiting. But it’s okay, right? Time is working for you. You’re getting closer to where you want to go.\nThe problem is it never really ends. Now you’re commuting to work, now you’re at a job, and it’s not one you really like, but you have to be there anyway because it’s the path to something else. And it’s fine, because every day you spend in this job is another day you get closer to having Four Years Experience, and meanwhile your investments are accruing compound interest, and your relationships are maturing, and all of this is part of the plan.\nHow should we properly deal with the paralyzing oppression of our temporal overlords? There are typically three answers:\n\nBeg Death for more time: Eat more vegetables, do more cardio, do more longevity research, become multiplanetary, align AGI, advocate degrowth, build solar panels.\nEmbrace Death in all its forms: Delist your website from Internet Archive, go skydiving, eat a five-pound gummy bear, marry Courtney Love.\nBecome immortal but only metaphorically: Have a lot of descendants, build a giant clock inside a mountain, send big prime numbers into space, invent fundamental physics, endow a fellowship, put your name on a building.\n\nThese stances all have their uses, but they’re still just one side of the axis.

Despite the younger generation’s righteous exodus from the platform, its user base to this day grows faster than the world population .\n\nBut even if every single person in the world got on Facebook, your network would still be mostly people you know in real life. While this is immensely useful for keeping in touch with friends and family who you’re away from, an identity-based social graph is fundamentally limited. Your Facebook identity and social graph are mere digital shadows of their physical counterparts, and little more.\n\nMeanwhile, a new trend is beginning to take hold in the neglected gaps of this status quo. It’s a complete reimagining of what social networks could be—a future free from the limitations of physical identity.\n\nOn Facebook and Instagram, we inevitably compare our real lives to our friends’ curated ones. Before them, MySpace and its top friends feature scandalized schoolyards across the world. Even though identity-based platforms try to faithfully represent real-life social dynamics, they often end up warping them.\n\nOverexposure to friends’ digital lives has had a deleterious effect on users, especially teens. It’s no surprise “Facebook depression” became a hot search term as early as 2009. By attaching our real-world identities to everything we do, these platforms feel suffocating and unsafe.\n\nNowadays, you can’t just have a conversation about basketball or mental health without your entire identity on display. At a glance, you could roughly tell a person’s age, race, location, body type, sometimes even religion, socioeconomic level, and institutional affiliations. Notably, they’re the exact things we tell kids not to reveal about themselves to strangers online.\n\nAs a result, despite growing up with worldwide, instantaneous connections mere taps away, digital natives feel more lonely than ever, especially in an age when an errant comment from years ago could get you de-platformed. In real life and on Facebook, you’re always signaling information about yourself which may not have anything to do with the context you’re in.\n\nSo why is this the case?\n\nSome say it’s because platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and the bygone MySpace are “simplified and diminished continuations of the physical dimension people reside in.”\n\nDespite these platforms having unfathomably large user bases, you tend to only connect with people you already know in real life. For Facebook users, this is the digital equivalent of only talking to existing friends at a party whose guest list includes literally a third of the world.\n\nThis phenomenon is fantastically catalogued in a 1992 HCI paper, Beyond Being There, which argues that technology tries too hard to imitate or replicate the experience of “being there.”\n\nThe paper introduces the comparison between a crutch and a shoe. Whereas a shoe can help you run faster, a crutch is designed to support you when you can’t walk normally, to get you as close as possible. A crutch will never help you run faster; it’s just an imitative substitute when the real thing isn’t available.\n\nIn this sense, Facebook’s social graph is a crutch that imitates real-world relationships.\n\nPlatforms which 1) require or encourage using your real identity or 2) rely on existing social graphs (contacts, classmates, mutuals) merely imitate “being there.” By mirroring the real world, platforms like Facebook are ultimately limited by the very physical connections they seek to transcend.\n\nHow might we do better? How might we build a shoe rather than a crutch? How might we leverage the unique capabilities of technology to create new ways of connecting which go “beyond being there?”\n\nThe answer lies somewhere in the rise of alts, finstas, burner accounts, and entirely pseudonymous platforms like Discord. In the not-so-distant future, deliberately facilitated pseudonymity could give rise to a truly digital social graph, rather than the acquaintance-based graphs of today.\n\nReddit started as a link aggregator, Discord as Skype but cool, and Twitch as internet voyeurism. Each platform has evolved over time to become the biggest pillars of today’s pseudonymous web.\n\nPseudonymity is, in short, the use of a username, or a pseudonym, rather than a real name. It’s related to anonymity, in that both imply a level of obfuscation, but whereas an anonymous user would not want to be identified at all, a pseudonymous user maintains a consistent persona across multiple interactions. A top Twitch donor, for instance, might seek recognition for their continued support in the form of a badge or shoutout.\n\nThe pseudonymous web is growing, and not just in the West. Last month, a Shanghai-based pseudonymous social network, Soul, filed for an IPO with the SEC.\n\nIf the West’s sad, lonely, and tech savvy Gen Z are increasingly flocking to the pseudonymous web, then their Chinese counterparts might already be ahead. Growing up without sibling s, bearing the crushing weight of their family’s hopes and dreams, and living in a society that leapfrogged to mobile, China’s Gen Z just might be sadder , lonelier , and even more tech addicted . If China’s youth is any indication of where youth are globally headed, then Soul is an excellent case study for the future of social media.\n\nFirst launched in late 2016, Soul is “a virtual social playground” that is “appearance-agnostic, interest-driven, decentralized and gamified.” Unlike identity-based networks and, well, real life, Soul envisions a space “free of the pressure that often comes with the complex and delicate social relations in the physical world.”\n\nThis is what “beyond being there” looks like. The types of activity supported by platforms like Discord and Soul are a direct result of deliberately facilitated pseudonymity, and could not be easily replicated on an identity-based platform.\n\nAs we’ll see, the following opportunities emerge on pseudonymous platforms:\n\nFor each, let’s see how Western incumbents capitalize, and how Soul takes it a step further.\n\nUnbeholden to their real world identities, users on pseudonymous platforms are free to connect with each other on the basis of whatever they choose.\n\nThe first step of this has been the creation of an interest-based social graph, with Discord as its poster child.\n\nSitting at over 140M monthly users, Discord is completely pseudonymous for everyone who wants to be, and encourages users to pick any username they want by appending a visually de-emphasized number at the end. Discord hosts a staggering variety of interest-based servers, ranging from creator fandoms, to blockchain development communities, to gamer friend groups.\n\nSimilarly, Discord’s asynchronous older brother Reddit has become more like a social network over time. There’s a subreddit for any random topic or interest you can think of these days.\n\nMany of these communities are conspicuously missing on platforms like Facebook and Slack, which feel too “above ground” or “buttoned up.” On those platforms, communities are gatherings of differentiated individuals; in contrast, Discord’s pseudonymity signals that the topic of the community is itself the focus, and that all individuals are defined in relation to that topic.\n\nSoul takes all this a step further. On Soul, it’s not just about connecting over a shared love for sneakers; it’s about connecting over fundamental personality traits, worldviews, or ways of being. And you don’t even need to be able to articulate those yourself; the app draws that out of you through a series of personality tests, then matches you with people it deems you likely to have chemistry with.\n\nThese tests are similar to Myers-Briggs or Enneagram, but instead of letters or numbers, “Soulers” get roles like “Pragmatist,” “Artist,” or “Thinker.” These roles are visible on each Souler’s profile, and are also used to sort them into one of 30 “planets.” These quizzes help Soul algorithmically match users with content and even other users.\n\nSoulers can continue to add to their profiles by taking additional Soul Quizzes as well as using “Gravity Tags,” which “attract” more suitable content and other Soulers. Based on each user’s traits and engagement, Soul generates a chemistry score for every other Souler they interact with, out of 100.\n\nFrom there, Soulers can self-organize into group chats or “Virtual Parties,” Soul’s Clubhouse clone. Similar to Clubhouse, it’s a collection of audio-based chat rooms where participants are split into on- and off-stage. Unlike Clubhouse, most of the rooms are either for hangout or karaoke (the latter highlighting the app’s Chinese roots), and, of course, everyone is pseudonymous.\n\nWhile pseudonymous platforms like Discord and Reddit empower users to connect over specific interests or hobbies, Soul is a place for kindred spirits.\n\nTogether, these platforms form digitally native social graphs based on what people choose to emphasize about themselves, rather than on legal identity or physical proximity. These social graphs are difficult to create on identity-based platforms, as well as in real life, and are the result of meaningful connections between people who otherwise would never have met .\n\nUsers on pseudonymous platforms give up some of the individuality they might otherwise be used to having. On the flip side, these users tend to be quite open and expressive.\n\nOn pseudonymous platforms, users are eager for self-expression, recognition, and clout—and will pay real money for it. As a result, these platforms can monetize in ways that add value to users (e.g., Reddit Gold, Discord Nitro, and Twitch donations), rather than relying solely on ads.\n\nSince the early days of Reddit, for example, users have purchased Reddit Gold to reward posts they like. A good chunk of Reddit’s historical revenue has come from Reddit Gold, which has since expanded to a number of other post awards, including subreddit-specific.\n\nSimilarly, Discord makes most of its money from users looking for more ways to express themselves. More than half of Discord Nitro’s benefits have to do with expression, whether through custom emojis, special profile badges, or boosting your favorite server. Like Twitch, Discord allows longtime server supporters to further express themselves via titles and rewards—yet another example of pseudonymous users signaling, within context, identities of their choosing.\n\nSoul, on the other hand, allows an even more direct form of self-expression via virtual avatars, which may or may not resemble Soulers’ real selves. Soulers are free to craft a persona to embody aspects of themselves they identify with or aspire to the most.\n\nSoulers can visit the avatar store and browse apparel from a selection of free and premium items, ranging from shirts and facial hair to masks and horns. Avatars are direct representations of each Souler, so dressing it up is essential for self-expression and standing out.\n\nSoulers can even pseudonymously video call each other as their avatars, rather than showing their real faces, similar to face filters.\n\nThanks to the prominence of avatars, much of Soul’s revenue is generated from Soulers purchasing Soul Coins to use in the avatar store, and from Soulers gifting each other items.\n\nTo further enhance the importance of avatars, Soul’s algorithm also de-prioritizes selfies and other personally identifying information on the global feed, funneling self-expression toward on-platform features.\n\nPseudonymity gives users a blank canvas of an identity to eagerly fill out. This way, instead of primarily monetizing through ads, platforms like Soul can provide value-add features for self-expression.\n\nIn addition to more genuine connections and self-expression, pseudonymous platforms also have the potential for much higher levels of participation and content creation.\n\nThe current, non-obvious example is actually TikTok.\n\nRather than just passively browsing, 55% of engaged TikTok users in a given month claimed to have uploaded a video. On a monthly basis, that means engaged users are nearly as likely to post a video as they are to follow or to comment. If this figure is anything close to the truth, it blows the 90/9/1 rule out of the water.\n\nBesides offering better video editing tools, how did TikTok achieve this?\n\nWhile TikTok isn’t pseudonymous per se, it features something that replicates the benefits of pseudonymity: a distribution algorithm that acts on your content, not your connections.\n\nThe most important consequence is that anybody can succeed on TikTok. People don’t need to be friends with you or already be following you. With the algorithm, people can engage directly with content they’re likely to enjoy, despite having no existing connection to creators. No need to find your audience—your audience finds you.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that you don’t need to import your real life friends lowers psychological barriers to posting. You’re free to experiment with whatever you want, knowing it’s not very likely you’ll get recognized—or worse, judged or cancelled—unless you go truly viral. TikTok is not explicitly pseudonymous, but its algorithm accomplishes similar goals.\n\nSoul, on the other hand, shows how a democratized content algorithm effectively complements pseudonymity by using it to drive nearly all interactions.\n\nTo start, the global feed visually resembles that of Facebook or Twitter, but it works more like TikTok’s. On Soul, everything—from text to audio snippets to polls—is globally shareable, not just with your followers, but with anyone.\n\nAs on TikTok, the result is that anyone can succeed on the strength of what they put out, rather than having to rely on endorsement by blue checkmarks or being famous off-platform. There’s still a “Following” tab, but Soul’s bread and butter, similar to TikTok’s, is an algorithm that is neither follow-dominated (Twitter) nor limited to specific groups/servers (Reddit/Discord).\n\nSoul also uses an algorithm to drive user-to-user interactions by matching them in voice calls or group chats. As previously mentioned, every other Souler you encounter has an associated score indicating how likely you are to get along. As a result, their recommendation engine not only lowers the barrier to posting globally, but also drives engagement for more direct connections.\n\nThe future vision of Soul is what they call an AI-powered “virtual playground,” where curation and discovery, regardless of form, is handled by an algorithm. This way, Soulers can find compelling content, meet kindred spirits, and go viral, all without Soul needing to know anything about who they are in person.\n\nAccording to Soul’s F-1, an impressive 35% of monthly Soulers post content, and Soulers average 62 daily 1-on-1 messages. On Soul, putting yourself out there has never been easier or felt safer.\n\nIdentity-based social networks have a ton of users, but are limited by real-world relationships and social dynamics. They’re crutches that merely imitate “being there.”\n\nPseudonymous platforms like Discord and Soul support communities and self-expression not found elsewhere. These facilitate connections otherwise not possible, and thus go “beyond being there.”\n\nBy capitalizing on what’s missing, pseudonymous platforms present the following opportunities:\n\nIn a nutshell, pseudonymous platforms are all about encouraging users to include information about themselves that they choose to or even aspire to identify with, while allowing them to exclude sensitive or irrelevant information. This enables entirely new ways of forging genuine connections and expressing yourself online.\n\nDemocratized, pseudonymous platforms like Soul have the potential to upend social media as we know it. They create social graphs that reflect our inner selves, rather than ones based on physical identity and all the baggage that comes with it. Their continued success shows that to bring the world closer together, platforms don’t need all your personally identifying data.

Call Yourself A Programmer, And Other Career Advice | Kalzumeus Software","link":"https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer","content":"If there was one course I could add to every engineering education, it wouldn’t involve compilers or gates or time complexity. It would be Realities Of Your Industry 101, because we don’t teach them and this results in lots of unnecessary pain and suffering. This post aspires to be README.txt for your career as a young engineer. The goal is to make you happy, by filling in the gaps in your education regarding how the “real world” actually works. It took me about ten years and a lot of suffering to figure out some of this, starting from “fairly bright engineer with low self-confidence and zero practical knowledge of business.” I wouldn’t trust this as the definitive guide, but hopefully it will provide value over what your college Career Center isn’t telling you.\n\n90% of programming jobs are in creating Line of Business software : Economics 101: the price for anything (including you) is a function of the supply of it and demand for it. Let’s talk about the demand side first. Most software is not sold in boxes, available on the Internet, or downloaded from the App Store. Most software is boring one-off applications in corporations, under-girding every imaginable facet of the global economy. It tracks expenses, it optimizes shipping costs, it assists the accounting department in preparing projections, it helps design new widgets, it prices insurance policies, it flags orders for manual review by the fraud department, etc etc. Software solves business problems. Software often solves business problems despite being soul-crushingly boring and of minimal technical complexity. For example, consider an internal travel expense reporting form. Across a company with 2,000 employees, that might save 5,000 man-hours a year (at an average fully-loaded cost of $50 an hour) versus handling expenses on paper, for a savings of $250,000 a year. It does not matter to the company that the reporting form is the world’s simplest CRUD app, it only matters that it either saves the company costs or generates additional revenue.\n\nThere are companies which create software which actually gets used by customers, which describes almost everything that you probably think of when you think of software. It is unlikely that you will work at one unless you work towards making this happen. Even if you actually work at one, many of the programmers there do not work on customer-facing software, either.\n\nEngineers are hired to create business value, not to program things : Businesses do things for irrational and political reasons all the time (see below), but in the main they converge on doing things which increase revenue or reduce costs. Status in well-run businesses generally is awarded to people who successfully take credit for doing one of these things. (That can, but does not necessarily, entail actually doing them.) The person who has decided to bring on one more engineer is not doing it because they love having a geek around the room, they are doing it because adding the geek allows them to complete a project (or projects) which will add revenue or decrease costs. Producing beautiful software is not a goal. Solving complex technical problems is not a goal. Writing bug-free code is not a goal. Using sexy programming languages is not a goal. Add revenue. Reduce costs. Those are your only goals.\n\nPeter Drucker — you haven’t heard of him, but he is a prophet among people who sign checks — came up with the terms Profit Center and Cost Center. Profit Centers are the part of an organization that bring in the bacon: partners at law firms, sales at enterprise software companies, “masters of the universe” on Wall Street, etc etc. Cost Centers are, well, everybody else. You really want to be attached to Profit Centers because it will bring you higher wages, more respect, and greater opportunities for everything of value to you. It isn’t hard: a bright high schooler, given a paragraph-long description of a business, can usually identify where the Profit Center is. If you want to work there, work for that. If you can’t, either a) work elsewhere or b) engineer your transfer after joining the company.\n\nEngineers in particular are usually very highly paid Cost Centers, which sets MBA’s optimization antennae to twitching. This is what brings us wonderful ideas like outsourcing, which is “Let’s replace really expensive Cost Centers who do some magic which we kinda need but don’t really care about with less expensive Cost Centers in a lower wage country”. (Quick sidenote: You can absolutely ignore outsourcing as a career threat if you read the rest of this guide.) Nobody ever outsources Profit Centers. Attempting to do so would be the setup for MBA humor. It’s like suggesting replacing your source control system with a bunch of copies maintained on floppy disks.\n\nDon’t call yourself a programmer : “Programmer” sounds like “anomalously high-cost peon who types some mumbo-jumbo into some other mumbo-jumbo.” If you call yourself a programmer, someone is already working on a way to get you fired. You know Salesforce, widely perceived among engineers to be a Software as a Services company? Their motto and sales point is “No Software”, which conveys to their actual customers “You know those programmers you have working on your internal systems? If you used Salesforce, you could fire half of them and pocket part of the difference in your bonus.” (There’s nothing wrong with this, by the way. You’re in the business of unemploying people. If you think that is unfair, go back to school and study something that doesn’t matter.)\n\nInstead, describe yourself by what you have accomplished for previously employers vis-a-vis increasing revenues or reducing costs. If you have not had the opportunity to do this yet, describe things which suggest you have the ability to increase revenue or reduce costs, or ideas to do so.\n\nThere are many varieties of well-paid professionals who sling code but do not describe themselves as slinging code for a living. Quants on Wall Street are the first and best-known example: they use computers and math as a lever to make high-consequence decisions better and faster than an unaided human could, and the punchline to those decisions is “our firm make billions of dollars.” Successful quants make more in bonuses in a good year than many equivalently talented engineers will earn in a decade or lifetime.\n\nSimilarly, even though you might think Google sounds like a programmer-friendly company, there are programmers and then there’s the people who are closely tied to 1% improvements in AdWords click-through rates. (Hint: provably worth billions of dollars.) I recently stumbled across a web-page from the guy whose professional bio is “wrote the backend billing code that 97% of Google’s revenue passes through.” He’s now an angel investor (a polite synonym for “rich”).\n\nYou are not defined by your chosen software stack : I recently asked via Twitter what young engineers wanted to know about careers. Many asked how to know what programming language or stack to study. It doesn’t matter. There you go.\n\nDo Java programmers make more money than .NET programmers? Anyone describing themselves as either a Java programmer or .NET programmer has already lost, because a) they’re a programmer (you’re not, see above) and b) they’re making themselves non-hireable for most programming jobs. In the real world, picking up a new language takes a few weeks of effort and after 6 to 12 months nobody will ever notice you haven’t been doing that one for your entire career. I did back-end Big Freaking Java Web Application development as recently as March 2010. Trust me, nobody cares about that. If a Python shop was looking for somebody technical to make them a pile of money, the fact that I’ve never written a line of Python would not get held against me.\n\nTalented engineers are rare — vastly rarer than opportunities to use them — and it is a seller’s market for talent right now in almost every facet of the field. Everybody at Matasano uses Ruby. If you don’t, but are a good engineer, they’ll hire you anyway. (A good engineer has a track record of — repeat after me — increasing revenue or decreasing costs.) Much of Fog Creek uses the Microsoft Stack. I can’t even spell ASP.NET and they’d still hire me.\n\nThere are companies with broken HR policies where lack of a buzzword means you won’t be selected. You don’t want to work for them, but if you really do, you can add the relevant buzzword to your resume for the costs of a few nights and weekends, or by controlling technology choices at your current job in such a manner that in advances your career interests. Want to get trained on Ruby at a .NET shop? Implement a one-off project in Ruby. Bam, you are now a professional Ruby programmer — you coded Ruby and you took money for it. (You laugh? I did this at a Java shop. The one-off Ruby project made the company $30,000. My boss was, predictably, quite happy and never even asked what produced the deliverable.)\n\nCo-workers and bosses are not usually your friends : You will spend a lot of time with co-workers. You may eventually become close friends with some of them, but in general, you will move on in three years and aside from maintaining cordial relations you will not go out of your way to invite them over to dinner. They will treat you in exactly the same way. You should be a good person to everyone you meet — it is the moral thing to do, and as a sidenote will really help your networking — but do not be under the delusion that everyone is your friend.\n\nFor example, at a job interview, even if you are talking to an affable 28 year old who feels like a slightly older version of you he is in a transaction . You are not his friend, you are an input for an industrial process which he is trying to buy for the company at the lowest price. That banter about World of Warcraft is just establishing a professional rapport, but he will (perfectly ethically) attempt to do things that none of your actual friends would ever do, like try to talk you down several thousand dollars in salary or guilt-trip you into spending more time with the company when you could be spending time with your actual friends. You will have other coworkers who — affably and ethically — will suggest things which go against your interests, from “I should get credit for that project you just did” (probably not phrased in so many words) to “We should do this thing which advances my professional growth goals rather than yours.” Don’t be surprised when this happens.\n\nYou radically overestimate the average skill of the competition because of the crowd you hang around with : Many people already successfully employed as senior engineers cannot actually implement FizzBuzz . Just read it and weep. Key takeaway: you probably are good enough to work at that company you think you’re not good enough for. They hire better mortals, but they still hire mortals.\n\n“Read ad. Send in resume. Go to job interview. Receive offer.” is the exception, not the typical case, for getting employment : Most jobs are never available publicly, just like most worthwhile candidates are not available publicly (see here ). Information about the position travels at approximately the speed of beer, sometimes lubricated by email. The decisionmaker at a company knows he needs someone. He tells his friends and business contacts. One of them knows someone — family, a roommate from college, someone they met at a conference, an ex-colleague, whatever. Introductions are made, a meeting happens, and they achieve agreement in principle on the job offer. Then the resume/HR department/formal offer dance comes about.\n\nThis is disproportionately true of jobs you actually want to get. “First employee at a successful startup” has a certain cachet for a lot of geeks, and virtually none of those got placed by sending in a cover letter to an HR department, in part because two-man startups don’t have enough scar tissue to form HR departments yet. (P.S. You probably don’t want to be first employee for a startup. Be the last co-founder instead.) Want to get a job at Google? They have a formal process for giving you a leg up because a Googler likes you. (They also have multiple informal ways for a Googler who likes you an awful lot to short-circuit that process. One example: buy the company you work for. When you have a couple of billion lying around you have many interesting options for solving problems.)\n\nThere are many reasons why most hiring happens privately. One is that publicly visible job offers get spammed by hundreds of resumes (particularly in this economy) from people who are stunningly inappropriate for the position. The other is that other companies are so bad at hiring that, if you don’t have close personal knowledge about the candidate, you might accidentally hire a non-FizzBuzzer.\n\nNetworking: it isn’t just for TCP packets : Networking just means a) meeting people who at some point can do things for you (or vice versa) and b) making a favorable impression on them.\n\nThere are many places to meet people. Events in your industry, such as conferences or academic symposia which get seen by non-academics, are one. User groups are another. Keep in mind that user groups draw a very different crowd than industry conferences and optimize accordingly.\n\nStrive to help people. It is the right thing to do, and people are keenly aware of who have in the past given them or theirs favors. If you ever can’t help someone but know someone who can, pass them to the appropriate person with a recommendation. If you do this right, two people will be happy with you and favorably disposed to helping you out in the future.\n\nYou can meet people over the Internet (oh God, can you), but something in our monkey brains makes in-the-flesh meeting a bigger thing. I’ve Internet-met a great many people who I’ve then gone on to meet in real life. The physical handshake is a major step up in the relationship, even when Internet-meeting lead to very consequential things like “Made them a lot of money through good advice.” Definitely blog and participate on your industry-appropriate watering holes like HN, but make it out to the meetups for it.\n\nAcademia is not like the real world : Your GPA largely doesn’t matter (modulo one high profile exception: a multinational advertising firm). To the extent that it does matter, it only determines whether your resume gets selected for job interviews. If you’re reading the rest of this, you know that your resume isn’t the primary way to get job interviews, so don’t spend huge amount of efforts optimizing something that you either have sufficiently optimized already (since you’ll get the same amount of interviews at 3.96 as you will at 3.8) or that you don’t need at all (since you’ll get job interviews because you’re competent at asking the right people to have coffee with you).\n\nYour major and minor don’t matter. Most decisionmakers in industry couldn’t tell the difference between a major in Computer Science and a major in Mathematics if they tried. I was once reduced to tears because a minor academic snafu threatened my ability to get a Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Science, which my advisor told me was more prestigious than a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Academia cares about distinctions like that. The real world does not.\n\nYour professors might understand how the academic job market works (short story: it is ridiculously inefficient in engineering and fubared beyond mortal comprehension in English) but they often have quixotic understandings of how the real world works. For example, they may push you to get extra degrees because a) it sounds like a good idea to them and b) they enjoy having research-producing peons who work for ramen. Remember, market wages for people capable of producing research are $80~100k+++ in your field. That buys an awful lot of ramen.\n\nThe prof in charge of my research project offered me a spot in his lab, a tuition waiver, and a whole $12,000 dollars as a stipend if I would commit 4~6 years to him. That’s a great deal if, and only if, you have recently immigrated from a low-wage country and need someone to intervene with the government to get you a visa.\n\nIf you really like the atmosphere at universities, that is cool. Put a backpack on and you can walk into any building at any university in the United States any time you want. Backpacks are a lot cheaper than working in academia. You can lead the life of the mind in industry, too — and enjoy less politics and better pay. You can even get published in journals, if that floats your boat. (After you’ve escaped the mind-warping miasma of academia, you might rightfully question whether Published In A Journal is really personally or societally significant as opposed to close approximations like Wrote A Blog Post And Showed It To Smart People.)\n\nHow much money do engineers make?\n\nWrong question. The right question is “What kind of offers do engineers routinely work for?”, because salary is one of many levers that people can use to motivate you. The answer to this is, less than helpfully, “Offers are all over the map.”\n\nIn general, big companies pay more (money, benefits, etc) than startups. Engineers with high perceived value make more than those with low perceived value. Senior engineers make more than junior engineers. People working in high-cost areas make more than people in low-cost areas. People who are skilled in negotiation make more than those who are not .\n\nWe have strong cultural training to not ask about salary, ever. This is not universal. In many cultures, professional contexts are a perfectly appropriate time to discuss money. (If you were a middle class Japanese man, you could reasonably be expected to reveal your exact salary to a 2nd date, anyone from your soccer club, or the guy who makes your sushi. If you owned a company, you’d probably be cagey about your net worth but you’d talk about employee salaries the way programmers talk about compilers — quite frequently, without being embarrassed.) If I were a Marxist academic or a conspiracy theorist, I might think that this bit of middle class American culture was specifically engineered to be in the interests of employers and against the interests of employees. Prior to a discussion of salary at any particular target employer, you should speak to someone who works there in a similar situation and ask about the salary range for the position. It is \u003c%= Date.today.year %\u003e; you can find these people online. (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and your (non-graph-database) social networks are all good to lean on.)\n\nAnyhow. Engineers are routinely offered a suite of benefits. It is worth worrying, in the United States, about health insurance (traditionally, you get it and your employer foots most or all of the costs) and your retirement program, which is some variant of “we will match contributions to your 401k up to X% of salary.” The value of that is easy to calculate: X% of salary. (It is free money, so always max out your IRA up to the employer match. Put it in index funds and forget about it for 40 years.)\n\nThere are other benefits like “free soda”, “catered lunches”, “free programming books”, etc. These are social signals more than anything else. When I say that I’m going to buy you soda, that says a specific thing about how I run my workplace, who I expect to work for me, and how I expect to treat them. (It says “I like to move the behavior of unsophisticated young engineers by making this job seem fun by buying 20 cent cans of soda, saving myself tens of thousands in compensation while simultaneously encouraging them to ruin their health.” And I like soda.) Read social signals and react appropriately — someone who signals that, e.g., employee education is worth paying money for might very well be a great company to work for — but don’t give up huge amounts of compensation in return for perks that you could trivially buy.\n\nHow do I become better at negotiation? This could be a post in itself. Short version:\n\na) Remember you’re selling the solution to a business need (raise revenue or decrease costs) rather than programming skill or your beautiful face.\n\nb) Negotiate aggressively with appropriate confidence, like the ethical professional you are. It is what your counterparty is probably doing. You’re aiming for a mutual beneficial offer, not for saying Yes every time they say something.\n\nc) “What is your previous salary?” is employer-speak for “Please give me reasons to pay you less money.” Answer appropriately.\n\nd) Always have a counteroffer. Be comfortable counteroffering around axes you care about other than money. If they can’t go higher on salary then talk about vacation instead.\n\ne) The only time to ever discuss salary is after you have reached agreement in principle that they will hire you if you can strike a mutually beneficial deal. This is late in the process after they have invested a lot of time and money in you, specifically, not at the interview. Remember that there are large costs associated with them saying “No, we can’t make that work” and, appropriately, they will probably not scuttle the deal over comparatively small issues which matter quite a bit to you, like e.g. taking their offer and countering for that plus a few thousand bucks then sticking to it.\n\nf) Read a book. Many have been written about negotiation. I like Getting To Yes. It is a little disconcerting that negotiation skills are worth thousands of dollars per year for your entire career but engineers think that directed effort to study them is crazy when that could be applied to trivialities about a technology that briefly caught their fancy.\n\nHow to value an equity grant :\n\nRoll d100. (Not the right kind of geek? Sorry. rand(100) then.)\n\n0~70: Your equity grant is worth nothing.\n\n71~94: Your equity grant is worth a lump sum of money which makes you about as much money as you gave up working for the startup, instead of working for a megacorp at a higher salary with better benefits.\n\n95~99: Your equity grant is a lifechanging amount of money. You won’t feel rich — you’re not the richest person you know, because many of the people you spent the last several years with are now richer than you by definition — but your family will never again give you grief for not having gone into $FAVORED_FIELD like a proper $YOUR_INGROUP.\n\n100: You worked at the next Google, and are rich beyond the dreams of avarice. Congratulations.\n\nPerceptive readers will note that 100 does not actually show up on a d100 or rand(100).\n\nWhy are you so negative about equity grants?\n\nBecause you radically overestimate the likelihood that your startup will succeed and radically overestimate the portion of the pie that will be allocated to you if the startup succeeds. Read about dilution and liquidation preferences on Hacker News or Venture Hacks, then remember that there are people who know more about negotiating deals than you know about programming and imagine what you could do to a program if there were several hundred million on the line.\n\nAre startups great for your career as a fresh graduate?\n\nThe high-percentage outcome is you work really hard for the next couple of years, fail ingloriously, and then be jobless and looking to get into another startup. If you really wanted to get into a startup two years out of school, you could also just go work at a megacorp for the next two years, earn a bit of money, then take your warchest, domain knowledge, and contacts and found one.\n\nWorking at a startup, you tend to meet people doing startups. Most of them will not be able to hire you in two years. Working at a large corporation, you tend to meet other people in large corporations in your area. Many of them either will be able to hire you or will have the ear of someone able to hire you in two years.\n\nSo would you recommend working at a startup? Working in a startup is a career path but, more than that, it is a lifestyle choice. This is similar to working in investment banking or academia. Those are three very different lifestyles. Many people will attempt to sell you those lifestyles as being in your interests, for their own reasons. If you genuinely would enjoy that lifestyle, go nuts. If you only enjoy certain bits of it, remember that many things are available a la carte if you really want them. For example, if you want to work on cutting-edge technology but also want to see your kids at 5:30 PM, you can work on cutting-edge technology at many, many, many megacorps.\n\n(Yeah, really. If it creates value for them, heck yes, they’ll invest in it. They’ll also invest in a lot of CRUD apps, but then again, so do startups — they just market making CRUD apps better than most megacorps do. The first hour of the Social Network is about making a CRUD app seem like sexy, the second is a Lifetime drama about a divorce improbably involving two heterosexual men.)\n\nYour most important professional skill is communication : Remember engineers are not hired to create programs and how they are hired to create business value? The dominant quality which gets you jobs is the ability to give people the perception that you will create value. This is not necessarily coextensive with ability to create value.\n\nSome of the best programmers I know are pathologically incapable of carrying on a conversation. People disproportionately a) wouldn’t want to work with them or b) will underestimate their value-creation ability because they gain insight into that ability through conversation and the person just doesn’t implement that protocol. Conversely, people routinely assume that I am among the best programmers they know entirely because a) there exists observable evidence that I can program and b) I write and speak really, really well.\n\n(Once upon a time I would have described myself as “Slightly below average” in programming skill. I have since learned that I had a radically skewed impression of the skill distribution, that programming skill is not what people actually optimize for, and that modesty is against my interests. These days if you ask me how good of a programmer I am I will start telling you stories about how I have programmed systems which helped millions of kids learn to read or which provably made companies millions. The question of where I am on the bell curve matters to no one, so why bother worrying about it?)\n\nCommunication is a skill. Practice it: you will get better. One key sub-skill is being able to quickly, concisely, and confidently explain how you create value to someone who is not an expert in your field and who does not have a priori reasons to love you. If when you attempt to do this technical buzzwords keep coming up (“Reduced 99th percentile query times by 200 ms by optimizing indexes on…”), take them out and try again. You should be able to explain what you do to a bright 8 year old, the CFO of your company, or a programmer in a different specialty, at whatever the appropriate level of abstraction is.\n\nYou will often be called to do Enterprise Sales and other stuff you got into engineering to avoid : Enterprise Sales is going into a corporation and trying to convince them to spend six or seven figures on buying a system which will either improve their revenue or reduce costs. Every job interview you will ever have is Enterprise Sales. Politics, relationships, and communication skills matter a heck of a lot, technical reality not quite so much.\n\nWhen you have meetings with coworkers and are attempting to convince them to implement your suggestions, you will also be doing Enterprise Sales. If getting stuff done is your job description, then convincing people to get stuff done is a core job skill for you. Spend appropriate effort on getting good at it. This means being able to communicate effectively in memos, emails, conversations, meetings, and PowerPoint (when appropriate). It means understanding how to make a business case for a technological initiative. It means knowing that sometimes you will make technological sacrifices in pursuit of business objectives and that this is the right call.\n\nModesty is not a career-enhancing character trait : Many engineers have self-confidence issues (hello, self). Many also come from upbringings where modesty with regards to one’s accomplishments is culturally celebrated. American businesses largely do not value modesty about one’s accomplishments. The right tone to aim for in interviews, interactions with other people, and life is closer to “restrained, confident professionalism.”\n\nIf you are part of a team effort and the team effort succeeds, the right note to hit is not “I owe it all to my team” unless your position is such that everyone will understand you are lying to be modest. Try for “It was a privilege to assist my team by leading their efforts with regards to $YOUR_SPECIALTY.” Say it in a mirror a thousand times until you can say it with a straight face. You might feel like you’re overstating your accomplishments. Screw that. Someone who claims to Lead Efforts To Optimize Production while having the title Sandwich Artist is overstating their accomplishments. You are an engineer. You work magic which makes people’s lives better. If you were in charge of the database specifically on an important project involving people then heck yes you lead the database effort which was crucial for the success of the project. This is how the game is played. If you feel poorly about it, you’re like a batter who feels poorly about stealing bases in baseball: you’re not morally superior, you’re just playing poorly\n\nAll business decisions are ultimately made by one or a handful of multi-cellular organisms closely related to chimpanzees, not by rules or by algorithms : People are people. Social grooming is a really important skill. People will often back suggestions by friends because they are friends, even when other suggestions might actually be better. People will often be favoritably disposed to people they have broken bread with. (There is a business book called Never Eat Alone. It might be worth reading, but that title is whatever the antonym of deceptive advertising is.) People routinely favor people who they think are like them over people they think are not like them. (This can be good, neutral, or invidious. Accepting that it happens is the first step to profitably exploiting it.)\n\nActual grooming is at least moderately important, too, because people are hilariously easy to hack by expedients such as dressing appropriately for the situation, maintaining a professional appearance, speaking in a confident tone of voice, etc. Your business suit will probably cost about as much as a computer monitor. You only need it once in a blue moon, but when you need it you’ll be really, really, really glad that you have it. Take my word for it, if I wear everyday casual when I visit e.g. City Hall I get treated like a hapless awkward twenty-something, if I wear the suit I get treated like the CEO of a multinational company. I’m actually the awkward twenty-something CEO of a multinational company, but I get to pick which side to emphasize when I want favorable treatment from a bureaucrat.\n\n(People familiar with my business might object to me describing it as a multinational company because it is not what most people think of when “multinational company” gets used in conversation. Sorry — it is a simple conversational hack. If you think people are pissed off at being manipulated when they find that out, well, some people passionately hate business suits, too. That doesn’t mean business suits are valueless. Be appropriate to the circumstances. Technically true answers are the best kind of answers when the alternative is Immigration deporting you, by the way.)\n\nAt the end of the day, your life happiness will not be dominated by your career. Either talk to older people or trust the social scientists who have: family, faith, hobbies, etc etc generally swamp career achievements and money in terms of things which actually produce happiness. Optimize appropriately. Your career is important, and right now it might seem like the most important thing in your life, but odds are that is not what you’ll believe forever. Work to live, don’t live to work.\n\nA few months ago I had the opportunity to have dinner with Ramit Sethi . We shot the breeze about business topics for a little while — optimizing email opt-in rates, A/B testing to victory, pricing strategies, and the like. Writing and selling software is solidly in my comfort zone and is what I usually talk about on this blog. If you want that, skip this post . We are going deep, deep into the fluffy bits!\n\nThis post will not help you sell more software. If you’re not fascinated by the inner workings of complex systems, go do something more important. If you are, grab some popcorn, because this is the best bug I’ve seen in years.\n\nMy name is Patrick McKenzie (better known as patio11 on the Internets.)\n\nI also write a weekly newsletter on the

To Understand Things\nPublished: July 1, 2020\nI.\n\nThe smartest person I’ve ever known had a habit that, as a teenager, I found striking. After he’d prove a theorem, or solve a problem, he’d go back and continue thinking about the problem and try to figure out different proofs of the same thing. Sometimes he’d spend hours on a problem he’d already solved. I had the opposite tendency: as soon as I’d reached the end of the proof, I’d stop since I’d “gotten the answer”. \nAfterwards, he’d come out with three or four proofs of the same thing, plus some explanation of why each proof is connected somehow. In this way, he got a much deeper understanding of things than I did. \n\n\n\nI concluded that what we call 'intelligence' is as much about virtues such as honesty, integrity, and bravery, as it is about 'raw intellect’. \nIntelligent people simply aren’t willing to accept answers that they don’t understand — no matter how many other people try to convince them of it, or how many other people believe it, if they aren’t able to convince them selves of it, they won’t accept it. Importantly, this is a ‘software’ trait \u0026 is independent of more ‘hardware’ traits such as processing speed, working memory, and other such things. \nMoreover, I have noticed that these ‘hardware’ traits vary greatly in the smartest people I know -- some are remarkably quick thinkers, calculators, readers, whereas others are ‘slow’. The software traits, though, they all have in common -- and can, with effort, be learned. What this means is that you can internalize good intellectual habits that, in effect, “increase your intelligence”. ‘Intelligence’ is not fixed.\n\nII. \n\nThis quality of “not stopping at an unsatisfactory answer” deserves some examination. \n\n\nOne component of it is energy: thinking hard takes effort, and it’s much easier to just stop at an answer that seems to make sense, than to pursue everything that you don’t quite get down an endless, and rapidly proliferating, series of rabbit holes. \nIt’s also so easy to think that you understand something, when you actually don’t. So even figuring out whether you understand something or not requires you to attack the thing from multiple angles and test your own understanding. \nThis requires a lot of intrinsic motivation, because it’s so hard; so most people simply don’t do it.  \n\nThe Nobel Prize winner William Shockley was fond of talking about “the will to think”:Motivation is at least as important as method for the serious thinker, Shockley believed...the essential element for successful work in any field was “the will to think”. This was a phrase he learned from the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi and never forgot. “In these four words,” Shockley wrote later, “[Fermi] distilled the essence of a very significant insight: A competent thinker will be reluctant to commit himself to the effort that tedious and precise thinking demands -- he will lack ‘the will to think’ -- unless he has the conviction that something worthwhile will be done with the results of his efforts.” The discipline of competent thinking is important throughout life... (source)But it’s not just energy. You have to be able to motivate yourself to spend large quantities of energy on a problem, which means on some level that not understanding something — or having a bug in your thinking — bothers you a lot. You have the drive, the will to know. \n\n\nRelated to this is honesty, or integrity: a sort of compulsive unwillingness, or inability, to lie to yourself. Feynman said that the first rule of science is that you do not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. It is uniquely easy to lie to yourself because there is no external force keeping you honest; only you can run the constant loop of asking “do I really understand this?”.  \n(This is why writing is important. It’s harder to fool yourself that you understand something when you sit down to write about it and it comes out all disjointed and confused. Writing forces clarity.)\nIII.\nThe physicist Michael Faraday believed nothing without being able to experimentally demonstrate it himself, no matter how tedious the demonstation. \nSimply hearing or reading of such things was never enough for Faraday. When assessing the work of others, he always had to repeat, and perhaps extend, their experiments. It became a lifelong habit—his way of establishing ownership over an idea. Just as he did countless times later in other settings, he set out to demonstrate this new phenomenon to his own satisfaction. When he had saved enough money to buy the materials, he made a battery from seven copper halfpennies and seven discs cut from a sheet of zinc, interleaved with pieces of paper soaked in salt water. He fixed a copper wire to each end plate, dipped the other ends of the wires in a solution of Epsom salts (magnesium sulfate), and watched. (source)Understanding something really deeply is connected to our physical intuition. A simple “words based” understanding can only go so far. Visualizing something, in three dimensions, can help you with a concrete “hook” that your brain can grasp onto and use as a model; understanding then has a physical context that it can “take place in”. \nThis is why Jesus speaks in parables throughout the New Testament — in ways that stick with you long after you’ve read them — rather than just stating the abstract principle. “Are not two sparrows sold for a cent? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.” can stick with you forever in a way that “God watches over all living beings” will not.\nFaraday, again, had this quality in spades -- the book makes clear that this is partly because he was bad at mathematics and thus understood everything through the medium of experiments, and contrasts this with the French scientists (such as Ampere) who understood everything in a highly abstract way. \nBut Faraday’s physical intuition led him to some of the most crucial discoveries in all of science:\nMuch as he admired Ampère's work, Faraday began to develop his own views on the nature of the force between a current-carrying wire and the magnetic needle it deflected. Ampère's mathematics (which he had no reason to doubt) showed that the motion of the magnetic needle was the result of repulsions and attractions between it and the wire. But, to Faraday, this seemed wrong, or, at least, the wrong way around. What happened, he felt, was that the wire induced a circular force in the space around itself, and that everything else followed from this. The next step beautifully illustrates Faraday's genius. Taking Sarah's fourteen-year-old brother George with him down to the laboratory, he stuck an iron bar magnet into hot wax in the bottom of a basin and, when the wax had hardened, filled the basin with mercury until only the top of the magnet was exposed. He dangled a short length of wire from an insulated stand so that its bottom end dipped in the mercury, and then he connected one terminal of a battery to the top end of the wire and the other to the mercury. The wire and the mercury now formed part of a circuit that would remain unbroken even if the bottom end of the wire moved. And move it did—in rapid circles around the magnet! (source)\n\n        \n    \nBeing able to generate these concrete examples, even when you’re not physically doing experiments, is important. I recently saw this striking representation of the “bag of words” model in NLP. If you were reading this in the usual dry mathematical way these things are represented, and then forced yourself to come up with a visualization like this, then you’d be much further on your way to really grasping the thing. \nConversely, if you’re not coming up with visuals like this, and your understanding of the thing remains on the level of equations or abstract concepts, you probably do not understand the concept deeply and should dig further. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother quality I have noticed in very intelligent people is being unafraid to look stupid. \nMalcolm Gladwell on his father:My father has zero intellectual insecurities... It has never crossed his mind to be concerned that the world thinks he’s an idiot. He’s not in that game. So if he doesn’t understand something, he just asks you. He doesn’t care if he sounds foolish. He will ask the most obvious question without any sort of concern about it... So he asks lots and lots of dumb, in the best sense of that word, questions. He’ll say to someone, ‘I don’t understand. Explain that to me.’ He’ll just keep asking questions until he gets it right, and I grew up listening to him do this in every conceivable setting. If my father had met Bernie Madoff, he would never have invested money with him because he would have said, ‘I don’t understand’ a hundred times. ‘I don’t understand how that works’, in this kind of dumb, slow voice. ‘I don’t understand, sir. What is going on?’Most people are not willing to do this -- looking stupid takes courage, and sometimes it’s easier to just let things slide. It is striking how many situations I am in where I start asking basic questions, feel guilty for slowing the group down, and it turns out that nobody understood what was going on to begin with (often people message me privately saying that they’re relieved I asked), but I was the only one who actually spoke up and asked about it. \nThis is a habit. It’s easy to pick up. And it makes you smarter.\nIV.\nI remember being taught calculus at school and getting stuck on the “dy/dx” notation (aka Leibniz notation) for calculus. \nThe “dy/dx” just looked like a fraction, it looked like we were doing division, but we weren’t actually doing division. “dy/dx” doesn’t mean “dy” divided by “dx”, it means “the value of an infinitesimal change in y with respect to an infinitesimal change in x”, and I didn’t see how you could break this thing apart as though it was simple division. \nAt one point the proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus involved multiplying out a polynomial, and along the way you could cancel out “dy*dx” because “both of these quantities are infinitesimal, so in effect this can be cancelled out”. This reasoning did not make sense.\nThe “proof” of the chain rule we were given looked like this. \n\n(Amusingly, you can even get correct results using invalid mathematics, like this. Even though this is clearly invalid, it doesn’t feel far off the “valid” proof of the chain rule I was taught.)\n\nIt turns out that my misgivings were right, and that the Leibniz notation is basically just a convenient shorthand and that you more or less can treat those things “as if” they are fractions, but the proof is super complicated etc. Moreover, the Leibniz shorthand is actually far more powerful and easier to work with than Newton’s functions-based shorthand, which is why mainland Europe got way ahead of England (which stuck with Newton’s notation) in calculus. And then all of the logical problems didn’t really get sorted out until Riemann came along 200 years later and formulated calculus in terms of limits. But all of that went over my head in high school.At the time, I was infuriated by these inadequate proofs, but I was under time pressure to just learn the operations so that I could answer exam questions because the class needed to move onto the next thing. \nAnd since you actually can answer the exam questions and mechanically perform calculus operations without ever deeply understanding calculus, it’s much easier to just get by and do the exam without really questioning the concepts deeply -- which is in fact what happens for most people. (See my essay on education.)\nHow many people actually go back and try and understand this, or other such topics, in a deeper way? Very few. Moreover, the ‘meta’ lesson is: don’t question it too deeply, you’ll fall behind. Just learn the algorithm, plug in the numbers, and pass your exams. Speed is of the essence. In this way, school kills the “will to understanding” in people.\nMy countervailing advice to people trying to understand something is: go slow. Read slowly, think slowly, really spend time pondering the thing. Start by thinking about the question yourself before reading a bunch of stuff about it. A week or a month of continuous pondering about a question will get you surprisingly far. \nAnd you’ll have a semantic mental ‘framework’ in your brain on which to then hang all the great things you learn from your reading, which makes it more likely that you’ll retain that stuff as well. I read somewhere that Bill Gates structures his famous “reading weeks” around an outline of important questions he’s thought about and broken down into pieces. e.g. he’ll think about “water scarcity” and then break it down into questions like “how much water is there in the world?”, “where does existing drinking water come from?”, “how do you turn ocean water into drinking water”, etc., and only then will he pick reading to address those questions. \nThis method is far more effective than just reading random things and letting them pass through you.\nV.\nThe best thing I have read on really understanding things is the Sequences, especially the section on Noticing Confusion.There are some mantra-like questions it can be helpful to ask as you’re thinking through things. Some examples:But what exactly is X? What is it? (h/t Laura Deming’s post)Why must X be true? Why does this have to be the case? What is the single, fundamental reason? Do I really believe that this is true, deep down? Would I bet a large amount of money on it with a friend?\nVI.Two parables:\n\nFirst, Ezra Pound’s parable of Agassiz, from his “ABC of Reading” (incidentally one of the most underrated books about literature). I’ve preserved his quirky formatting:No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish:\n\nA post-graduate student equipped with honours and diplomas went to Agassiz to receive the final and finishing touches.\nThe great man offered him a small fish and told him to describe it.\nPost-Graduate Student: “That’s only a sun-fish”\nAgassiz: “I know that. Write a description of it.”\nAfter a few minutes the student returned with the description of the Ichthus Heliodiplodokus, or whatever term is used to conceal the common sunfish from vulgar knowledge, family of Heliichterinkus, etc., as found in textbooks of the subject.\nAgassiz again told the student to describe the fish.The student produced a four-page essay.\nAgassiz then told him to look at the fish. At the end of the three weeks the fish was in an advanced state of decomposition, but the student knew something about it.The second, one of my favorite passages from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance”:\nHe'd been having trouble with students who had nothing to say. At first he thought it was laziness but later it became apparent that it wasn't. They just couldn't think of anything to say. \nOne of them, a girl with strong-lensed glasses, wanted to write a five-hundredword essay about the United States. He was used to the sinking feeling that comes from statements like this, and suggested without disparagement that she narrow it down to just Bozeman. \nWhen the paper came due she didn't have it and was quite upset. She had tried and tried but she just couldn't think of anything to say. \nHe had already discussed her with her previous instructors and they'd confirmed his impressions of her. She was very serious, disciplined and hardworking, but extremely dull. Not a spark of creativity in her anywhere. Her eyes, behind the thick-lensed glasses, were the eyes of a drudge. She wasn't bluffing him, she really couldn't think of anything to say, and was upset by her inability to do as she was told.\n It just stumped him. Now he couldn't think of anything to say. A silence occurred, and then a peculiar answer: \"Narrow it down to the main street of Bozeman.\" It was a stroke of insight. \nShe nodded dutifully and went out. But just before her next class she came back in real distress, tears this time, distress that had obviously been there for a long time. She still couldn't think of anything to say, and couldn't understand why, if she couldn't think of anything about all of Bozeman, she should be able to think of something about just one street. \nHe was furious. \"You're not looking!\" he said. A memory came back of his own dismissal from the University for having too much to say. For every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. The more you look the more you see. She really wasn't looking and yet somehow didn't understand this.\n \nHe told her angrily, \"Narrow it down to the front of one building on the main street of Bozeman. The Opera House. Start with the upper left-hand brick.\" \nHer eyes, behind the thick-lensed glasses, opened wide. She came in the next class with a puzzled look and handed him a five- thousand-word essay on the front of the Opera House on the main street of Bozeman, Montana. \"I sat in the hamburger stand across the street,\" she said, \"and started writing about the first brick, and the second brick, and then by the third brick it all started to come and I couldn't stop. They thought I was crazy, and they kept kidding me, but here it all is. I don't understand it.\" \n\nNeither did he, but on long walks through the streets of town he thought about it and concluded she was evidently stopped with the same kind of blockage that had paralyzed him on his first day of teaching. She was blocked because she was trying to repeat, in her writing, things she had already heard, just as on the first day he had tried to repeat things he had already decided to say. She couldn't think of anything to write about Bozeman because she couldn't recall anything she had heard worth repeating. She was strangely unaware that she could look and see freshly for herself, as she wrote, without primary regard for what had been said before. The narrowing down to one brick destroyed the blockage because it was so obvious she had to do some original and direct seeing.\n\nThe point of both of these parables: nothing beats direct experience. Get the data yourself. This is why I wanted to analyze the coronavirus genome directly, for example. You develop some basis in reality by getting some first-hand data, and reasoning up from there, versus starting with somebody else’s lossy compression of a messy, evolving phenomenon and then wondering why events keep surprising you.  People who have not experienced the thing are unlikely to be generating truth. More likely, they’re resurfacing cached thoughts and narratives. Reading popular science books or news articles is not a substitute for understanding, and may make you stupider, by filling your mind with narratives and stories that don’t represent your own synthesis. \nEven if you can’t experience the thing directly, try going for information-dense sources with high amounts of detail and facts, and then reason up from those facts. On foreign policy, read books published by university presses -- not The Atlantic or The Economist or whatever. You can read those after you’ve developed a model of the thing yourself, against which you can judge the popular narratives.\nAnother thing the parable about the bricks tells us: understanding is not a binary “yes/no”. It has layers of depth. My friend understood Pythagoras’s theorem far more deeply than I did; he could prove it six different ways and had simply thought about it for longer.\nThe simplest things can reward close study. Michael Nielsen has a nice example of this -- the equals sign:I first really appreciated this after reading an essay by the mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov. You might suppose a great mathematician such as Kolmogorov would be writing about some very complicated piece of mathematics, but his subject was the humble equals sign: what made it a good piece of notation, and what its deficiencies were. Kolmogorov discussed this in loving detail, and made many beautiful points along the way, e.g., that the invention of the equals sign helped make possible notions such as equations (and algebraic manipulations of equations).Prior to reading the essay I thought I understood the equals sign. Indeed, I would have been offended by the suggestion that I did not. But the essay showed convincingly that I could understand the equals sign much more deeply. (link)The photographer Robert Capa advised beginning photographers: “If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough”. (This is good fiction writing advice, by the way.)\n\n It is also good advice for understanding things. When in doubt, go closer.\nThanks to Jose-Luis Ricon for reading a draft of this essay.\nFollow me on Twitter:

and other noise - by Nicole - startingfromnix","link":"https://nicoles.substack.com/p/desire-and-other-noise?s=r","content":"desire and other noise clarity and solitude\n\nhi friends, a short letter today. I wrote this in 2 hours and it is unedited :)\n\nI’ve been moving around a lot and will continue to be out of home for quite some time. This weekend I was in Chicago, in the next few weeks I’ll be in new cities once again. One night I walked home after work, watched the snow drift softly over the city — the lights cast a blurry yellow glow over the sidewalks. I was fucking freezing but it was also sort of romantic? I do these walks all the time, in every city I live in, in every city I visit, because I crave aloneness and seek it out often. I also love the quiet. I don’t do too well with too much noise. It clouds my decisions.\n\nSolitude is so delicious because it gives you clarity in a very noisy world. I have a million ads, or a million people, telling me what to do. When I’m alone I have to do the hard discerning process of reaching beneath what I think I’m supposed to do and grasping for what I actually want. Cities function as desire mechanisms too. New York makes you desire intensity and status, SF makes you desire thought-leadership and maybe freedom. I grew up in a place that desired order and risk aversion, and I’m still trying to figure out how much of that I believe. These aren’t inherently bad things, I’ve just become more aware of how places and people can make you believe certain characteristics are more sacred than others.\n\nIn doubt, we look to people to tell us or signal to us what is important. We absorb interest from the people we love like little sponges. I used to have this terrible habit of mimicking people I was romantically interested in, feign interest in their curiosities, squeeze myself into their interests and ideals. Like I believed in X because I was totally in love with the person who liked X. Then when I finally learned how to separate love from interest it was like lifting up a very heavy set of goggles off my face.\n\nI know this phenomenon is only natural — Rene Girard posits that desire is mimetic: how and what we desire is learned from the desires of others. These palisades and layers of wanting are created early on from the people closest to us.\n\nThe truth is that my desires are derivative, mediated by others, and that I’m part of an ecology of desire that is bigger than I can fully understand - ‘Wanting’ by Luke Burgis\n\nI think about the ecology, the system of desire, all the time. How it is endlessly complex. People emanate desire; you are changed simply by witnessing it for a prolonged period of time. Oftentimes, we are assigned roles in other people's stories and play that role so persuasively until we ourselves believe in it.\n\nSo I often return to this quote by Kurt Vonnegut: “We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.”\n\nBut somehow over the past few years I finally came this point where I said to myself… ok, what the hell do I actually want. What do I enjoy, what energizes/drains me? Do I actually like this person or do I just want them to like me? Do I like this thing or does everyone else just like it? Pretty basic questions, I know, but for too long I never stopped for more than 2 seconds to ask myself that. I was consumed by noise, sinking through it. When I finally started being honest with myself, it was so much easier to set boundaries. I stopped going to things out of obligation and now I can say 95% of the time if I show up to something I actually want to be there. I actually can be fully present, engaged, loving. Instead of this half-formed thing that showed up to the party mangled and exhausted for the face-value. I don’t half-ass a lot of things anymore, and I think that marks a type of freedom that comes with realizing your capacities and your desires. I used to think freedom was the ability to do as much as possible and now I realize a version of freedom is simply saying no. One of the (many) mantras of this newsletter: own your desires when you have them and never delegate them to anyone else.\n\n“We all forget continually. The genius, because he watches himself, remembers. He naïvely remembers his dreams, he ruthlessly remembers his real experiences, and gradually, very gradually, he learns to remember the exact nature of his mistakes and successes as a man applying paint to a flat surface. And so he recognizes what others have felt but never known. Technique and genius are nothing more nor less than recognition.” - John Berger\n\nPS: Happy Valentine’s Day!

This is a letter I wish somebody had written to me when I was 17.\n\nNotice I didn’t say ‘aim to be great,’ or ‘just have fun’. Both of those are stupid directives, because they’re overly vague. And trust me, the two most frustrating things you can get caught up in are “Will I be great? Am I good enough?” and “Am I having fun?” You have a far greater shot at tasting greatness and fun if you simply write as much as you possibly can, and then some.\n\nYou might think that you ought to try to write the best song that you possibly can, but you’d be wrong. That’s actually a trap that you should try your hardest to avoid, especially when you’re just starting out.\n\nWhy? Because your concept of ‘best’ is a work-in-progress and a moving target. Why spend a year working on writing the best song you can, when you could instead spend a year improving your idea of what makes a song great?\n\nYou don’t actually know what makes a good song, you don’t actually know what matters to you, you don’t actually know what you ought to be writing about. (Some veterans will tell you that they don’t know either, but at least they know that they don’t know, and songwriting is their way of figuring that stuff out.)\n\nSo don’t worry about any of that.\n\nJust write a song. Make it as stupid and silly as you can. Finish it. Allow it to be a little strange, weird and rough around the edges. In fact, go especially out of your way to try and write the worst song ever. Then try and top that with something even worse, if possible. It’s hard to find good ideas when you’re looking for good ideas, but you can sometimes find them just next door when you’re looking for bad ideas.\n\nWhen you’ve written a hundred songs, you’ll look back and realize that you’ve learnt things that you couldn’t possibly have anticipated when you were starting out. I haven’t written a hundred songs, but this is my experience with writing blogposts, and I imagine songs are no different. Quantity has a quality all of its own.\n\nTrying to be original is exhausting, and it is impossible. Give up the pursuit altogether. There’s no such thing as original, everything is derivative. Everything is a remix. The artists who are held up as ‘original’ are simply much better at remixing than everybody else. They make familiar remixes with elements people don’t quite expect, or they make unfamiliar mixes with familiar elements.\n\nAll great artists start out producing derivative work. There’s no other way to learn! You learned walking and talking through imitation, and you’ll learn to write by doing the same. ‘Originality’ or ‘personal style’ are things that emerge not from you trying to be creative or original, but from you trying to make things as well as you possibly can.\n\n“At an art school where I once studied, the students wanted most of all to develop a personal style. But if you just try to make good things, you’ll inevitably do it in a distinctive way, just as each person walks in a distinctive way. Michelangelo was not trying to paint like Michelangelo. He was just trying to paint well; he couldn’t help painting like Michelangelo.” – Paul Graham, Taste for Makers\n\nThe Beatles and Bob Dylan and many, many others all started out by imitating the work of others. Even Mozart, I believe. You’re no better than them, and you’re no different, either. So just make stuff. Make and make and make and make.\n\nWhen I look back on my life and my work, I find that I greatly overvalued ‘smartness’. On hindsight, I would happily trade quite a chunk of ‘intelligence’ for ‘more data points’. Both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have interesting things to say about this. Let me quickly paraphrase both of them:\n\nGates: Intelligence is the ability to enter a new field and to ask thoughtful questions- Well, what about this? What about that? What if we reversed it? To get good at this, you just need to turn things around and over in your head as much as you can. Take things apart, put them back together. Over time you’ll notice that things aren’t as opaque as they seem. Really, everything is made up of other things, and it’s not too difficult to start seeing patterns in the way they work.\n\nJobs: Creativity is just connecting things , and to connect things you need two things- a bunch of dots to connect, and the habit of attempting connections. You won’t get them right all the time right from the beginning. Nobody does, and there’s reason to believe that you’ll never quite improve your batting average. You can only just step up to the plate more often. So collect as many dots as you can, and mess around with connections as much as you can. Tinker. Make a mess. Clean it up and start over.\n\nI never bothered with these early on. They both bored and intimidated me. Why would anybody learn to play scales, when they’re both boring and difficult? The guy in the video above gives a GREAT explanation that I wish I had when I was a kid. (YouTube is such an INCREDIBLE resource.) I finally picked them up out of boredom and curiosity when I had a guitar and a lot of free time during my mandatory military conscription. I practiced the major and minor scales up and down the fretboard. I did it because I was curious about the differences between the major and minor scales, and I vaguely sort-of wanted to explore the differences.\n\nI didn’t know what to expect, but here’s what happened. I developed a bit of a sense of it, and it felt like a whole new world in the space I already inhabited. Each note has a certain flavor, and the different notes have different relationships with each other, just as words do. After a while you develop a certain “rhythm” or “prosody” for notes. It gives you the vocabulary and ability you sort of need to better process what you hear.\n\nPlaying scales trains and improves your ear, and I personally found them very transformative as a musician. This is coming from a person who absolutely hated music theory when I first encountered it, and hates practicing. It also gave me a sense of possibility– I started to understand how professional musicians are just more in tune with their ears and their instruments than I am, rather than mystical alien creatures.\n\nDeliberate practice is the smart, lazy thing to do. It requires the least effort for the greatest output in the long run. It’s the fastest way to get better. It just requires you to pay careful attention, and to focus on your weaknesses. That can be a little counter-intuitive, but it’s so incredibly powerful I wish somebody taught it to me when I was younger.\n\nMan, it took me years to do this. When I was starting out, I was so edgy, anxious and excitable that I tried to go as loud and as fast as I could with everything I played. That was the only way I knew how to be intense. But that gets old and tiring really, really fast. It wears you down.\n\nThe joy of music is in timing, in placement, in tastefulness. You need to be relaxed and learn to feel the groove, feel the beat. Lots of practice will help with this. And lots of listening. Listen to yourself when you play. Listen to the rest of the band that you’re playing it. Music isn’t about proving yourself, it isn’t about showing off, it’s about appreciation. Kind of like sex.\n\nThis goes back to connecting the dots. Watch lots of movies. Read lots of books. And this is maybe the most important part- write down your thoughts about them. Try to capture them in song, if you like.\n\nHave some records of what you thought about things at a certain time in your life. The main reason for this is so that you can look back at them years later and see how much you’ve grown and changed as a person. I think that’s very fundamental to appreciating life, and music, and expression of any kind. A blog is a great way to do this. Notebooks and recordings are fine, if you’re shy. (Nothing beats publishing stuff in the public domain, though, because you get real feedback from real people.)\n\nI especially recommend reading biographies, and reading about how your favorite artists talk about their creative processes, but always make sure you spend more time creating than reading about creating.\n\nIf you’re not creating, you’re decaying, you’re dying, and you’re going to start feeling sorry for yourself. You’re going to start being miserable, you’re going to start getting into boring conversations and arguments with other people who’re procrastinating and distracting themselves from their work.\n\nIf you feel like you have nothing to say, then take a long walk. Listen to some strange and unfamiliar music. Or listen to some really familiar music from your childhood. Think of it as a pilgrimage, or a declutter, whatever you like. Your cup is empty, so go fill it.","tokenFrequency":{"relationship":1,"either":2,"horribl":1,"graham":1,"hindsight":1,"imagin":1,"also":1,"decay":1,"someth":1,"profession":1,"certain":3,"youtub":1,"rest":1,"knew":1,"notic":2,"write":9,"bill":1,"anybodi":1,"transform":1,"figur":1,"strang":2,"thought":3,"cup":1,"attempt":1,"element":2,"style":2,"pattern":1,"get":7,"ever":1,"notebook":1,"relax":1,"experi":1,"step":1,"next":1,"fastest":1,"hear":1,"better":4,"realiz":1,"whatev":1,"main":1,"avoid":1,"feel":4,"who'r":1,"you'r":13,"frustrat":1,"written":3,"made":1,"took":1,"placement":1,"question":1,"part":1,"pursuit":1,"bother":1,"creatur":1,"you'v":3,"record":2,"movi":1,"pay":1,"tell":1,"just":1,"much":5,"songwrit":2,"sens":2,"rather":1,"even":2,"wear":1,"learn":5,"need":4,"video":1,"collect":1,"bad":1,"top":1,"fun":2,"ear":2,"revers":1,"chang":1,"later":1,"go":6,"plate":1,"“rhythm”":1,"overvalu":1,"procrastin":1,"there":3,"turn":1,"joy":1,"school":1,"field":1,"mystic":1,"studi":1,"hundr":2,"die":1,"other":2,"artist":3,"that":2,"ought":2,"abil":2,"look":5,"direct":1,"tune":1,"happili":1,"aim":1,"bit":1,"note":3,"imit":2,"finish":1,"emerg":1,"shi":1,"haven't":1,"they'r":2,"beatl":1,"greatest":1,"everybodi":1,"pilgrimag":1,"lot":5,"smart":2,"childhood":1,"talk":2,"groov":1,"fact":1,"prove":1,"back":5,"see":2,"great":8,"put":1,"shot":1,"littl":2,"begin":1,"tinker":1,"17":1,"gave":1,"world":1,"domain":1,"loud":1,"would":2,"don't":7,"appreci":2,"tast":3,"paraphras":1,"alreadi":1,"know":7,"never":2,"mix":1,"musician":2,"fine":1,"conscript":1,"new":2,"sometim":1,"resourc":1,"declutt":1,"“prosody”":1,"learnt":1,"teenag":1,"happen":1,"attent":1,"show":1,"els":1,"requir":2,"incred":2,"import":1,"feedback":1,"intens":1,"output":1,"habit":1,"ask":1,"person":6,"theori":1,"over":1,"care":1,"sure":1,"blog":1,"qualiti":1,"trust":1,"clean":1,"practic":4,"move":1,"way":9,"captur":1,"familiar":3,"start":11,"two":2,"noth":2,"“will":1,"argument":1,"develop":3,"convers":1,"simpli":2,"rough":1,"play":6,"michelangelo":2,"togeth":1,"anxious":1,"could":2,"seem":1,"–":1,"absolut":1,"song":10,"watch":1,"tire":1,"imposs":1,"often":1,"altogeth":1,"younger":1,"sing":1,"major":2,"differ":6,"real":2,"time":6,"interest":1,"wrong":1,"paint":3,"biographi":1,"workinprogress":1,"sort":1,"fundament":1,"michelangelo”":1,"take":2,"apart":1,"good":6,"effort":1,"encount":1,"dot":3,"excit":1,"militari":1,"publish":1,"origin":5,"fretboard":1,"opaqu":1,"thing":16,"spend":3,"read":4,"band":2,"book":1,"curios":1,"weak":1,"possibility–":1,"you'll":5,"work":6,"you'd":1,"want":2,"held":1,"quantiti":1,"whole":1,"mandatori":1,"let":1,"sortof":1,"think":3,"man":1,"guy":1,"walk":3,"fast":2,"nobodi":1,"caught":1,"kid":1,"miser":1,"it":5,"first":1,"listen":5,"hate":2,"":26,"concept":1,"right":2,"enough”":1,"sorri":1,"earli":1,"kind":2,"pick":1,"matter":1,"minor":2,"dylan":1,"job":2,"felt":1,"scale":4,"mayb":1,"least":2,"here":1,"express":1,"grown":1,"won't":1,"steve":1,"creat":3,"creativ":3,"free":1,"public":1,"produc":1,"old":1,"letter":1,"deliber":1,"aren't":1,"guitar":1,"quit":3,"data":1,"flavor":1,"silli":1,"say":3,"trap":1,"head":1,"might":1,"word":1,"edg":1,"enter":1,"paul":1,"realli":4,"mozart":1,"“am":1,"wors":1,"distract":1,"curious":1,"point":1,"averag":1,"“at":1,"distinct":2,"chunk":1,"process":2,"run":1,"bore":3,"find":3,"fun”":1,"like":7,"unfamiliar":2,"idea":5,"favorit":1,"hard":1,"understand":1,"explan":1,"believ":2,"instrument":1,"allow":1,"connect":6,"instead":1,"i'd":1,"stuff":3,"come":1,"recommend":1,"boredom":1,"lazi":1,"trade":1,"weird":1,"goe":1,"greater":1,"long":2,"taught":1,"space":1,"alway":1,"blogpost":1,"worst":1,"peopl":3,"vocabulari":1,"remix":3,"isn't":2,"everyth":4,"wish":3,"bass":1,"deriv":2,"quick":1,"student":1,"art":1,"music":6,"tri":12,"gate":2,"especi":3,"reason":2,"expect":2,"life":3,"give":3,"intellig":2,"maker":1,"didn't":2,"door":1,"alien":1,"mess":2,"help":2,"stupid":2,"bob":1,"improv":3,"actual":4,"couldn't":2,"far":1,"year":4,"inevit":1,"though":1,"power":1,"somebodi":2,"explor":1,"make":14,"empti":1,"sex":1,"possibl":5,"difficult":2,"well":3,"exhaust":1,"fill":1,"bat":1,"more":1,"best":3,"around":3,"anticip":1,"mani":3,"target":1,"found":1,"hardest":1,"intimid":1,"focus":1,"counterintuit":1,"vagu":2,"inhabit":1,"toy":1,"worri":1,"train":1,"veteran":1,"edgi":1,"beat":2,"final":1,"bunch":1}},"19593":{"id":"19593","title":"Work-from-home will shift power from workers to owners","link":"https://venturecommune.substack.com/p/work-from-home-will-shift-power-from?s=r","content":"Today I’m going to try to tie together a few concepts to try and understand the sudden shift to remote work in tech, while continuing my series on how my worldview has shifted since becoming a socialist. At the end I try and develop an understanding of how capitalists influence the kind of technology that gets developed, not always to the users’ benefit. And by the way, thanks to the Twink Revolution podcast for having me on this week to bullshit about tech and DSA.\n\nThere are a lot of silver linings to the collapse of the Bay Area as the all-but-sole tech hub of the world: spreading the wealth of tech around geographically, flexibility for workers to live where they want, and relieving pressure on Bay Area infrastructure. I frequently deride the Sand Hill tariff, the idea that anytime any person on earth engages in commerce, orders a taxi, gets takeout, or messages their loved ones, a company in California and a venture capitalist on Sand Hill Road gets a cut. That had to change. In the past, when I was a bit more of a tech booster, I would have focused on these positive aspects and gotten excited about the possibilities of a more diverse set of people building towards our glorious technological future.\n\nToday, I’m more likely to ask who benefits? and who loses? when I see a change in the workplace. Or, to quote my favorite Game of Thrones character: “What's the worst reason they could possibly have for saying what they say and doing what they do? Then I ask myself, 'How well does that reason explain what they say and what they do?’” (I confess that Game of Thrones for me is like Harry Potter for liberals —it’s where all my political understanding comes from.)\n\nSo here’s my particularly naive I-used-to-believe for the week:\n\nI used to believe everyone working in tech was on the same side, really. We are all engaged in a collective endeavor to build new ways of living in the world assisted by technology, leading to a better world and less toil. The people who invest in tech companies mostly love products and strive to foster creation, and they’re rewarded for doing so. Founders make sacrifices and take on risks to organize bastions of order in a sea of chaos in order to advance technology. Users are equal stakeholders in the process, as ultimately everything we do serves them, and they should be both invested in and grateful for the process of technological development.\n\nAfter analyzing the structure of the tech industry more closely, now I believe that the tech industry, like any other industry, is made up of actors with irreconcilably contradictory interests. The investor tier of the industry only seeks profitable returns, which are often at odds with the interests of founders, workers, and customers. Investors, founders, and highly-paid workers generally occupy contradictory class locations.\n\nIn my defense, Stanford in the 2000s basically taught this to STEM students.\n\nKim-Mai Cutler has a good summary of winners and losers from the WFH trend. I would add to the list of losers: my paycheck, assuming I ever work in tech again.\n\nLet’s talk about labor’s share of income. This is, as I understand it, the sum of all wages earned divided by nominal GDP. Basically, it says what slice of the pie created by mixing labor and capital accrues to workers and what share is given to owners. Since the 1980s, labor’s share has been in decline ; this is a symptom of that new kind of liberalism they keep talking about. Let’s try to understand the division of incomes between capital and labor using a class war hypothesis : the interests of owners and workers are fundamentally opposed, and a dollar that goes to the owner is a dollar that doesn’t go to the worker. This is in contrast to a growth hypothesis that would argue something like “a rising tide lifts all boats”. I can imagine that the growth hypothesis held true at some point in capitalist history. It does not seem remotely defensible in 2020.\n\nI argue that even as they ‘flatten’ the distribution of wages, WFH policies are going to result in a net gain for owners and a net loss for workers, considered as a class. An engineer that cost a company $400k (including benefits) in the Bay Area is going to cost them less now. The pool of workers has increased in size, so I should expect wages in the Bay Area to go down now. Once WFH is normalized, it will matter less if an engineer is in Cleveland or Warsaw, so now American tech workers are competing with engineers around the entire world. Operating expenditures at companies will fall accordingly, and associated expenses like real estate and office maintenance will go down as well. That’s more money for the company to spend on stock buybacks, and that’s what they will do.\n\nOne astute reader asked, essentially, if a company now chooses to hire engineers “two for the price of one”, is that a net benefit to workers since two cheaper workers have been hired? That’s a good question that I’m still thinking through. Marx examines the point in Wage Labor and Capital when considering whether the interests of labor and capital are aligned, since a wealthier capitalist can hire more laborers: (shout-out to the Friday night Marx reading group for explaining this to me)\n\nCapital can multiply itself only by exchanging itself for labour-power, by calling wage-labour into life. The labour-power of the wage-labourer can exchange itself for capital only by increasing capital, by strengthening that very power whose slave it is. Increase of capital, therefore, is increase of the proletariat, i.e., of the working class.\n\nAnd so, the bourgeoisie and its economists maintain that the interest of the capitalist and of the labourer is the same. And in fact, so they are! The worker perishes if capital does not keep him busy. Capital perishes if it does not exploit labour-power, which, in order to exploit, it must buy. The more quickly the capital destined for production – the productive capital – increases, the more prosperous industry is, the more the bourgeoisie enriches itself, the better business gets, so many more workers does the capitalist need, so much the dearer does the worker sell himself. The fastest possible growth of productive capital is, therefore, the indispensable condition for a tolerable life to the labourer.\n\nBut what is growth of productive capital? Growth of the power of accumulated labour over living labour; growth of the rule of the bourgeoisie over the working class. When wage-labour produces the alien wealth dominating it, the power hostile to it, capital, there flow back to it its means of employment – i.e., its means of subsistence, under the condition that it again become a part of capital, that is become again the lever whereby capital is to be forced into an accelerated expansive movement.\n\nI think this is easy enough to understand: under capitalist hegemony, what’s good for the boss is good for the worker, kind of, but it strengthens the power the boss continues to hold over the worker. This is the pinion of capital. Maybe the only strange concept might be “accumulated labour versus living labour”. This is a way to view capital: as dead labor. If I spend some time writing code for a company, the time is gone and the product of it has become capital owned by the company. The labor is dead as soon as I finish producing the output.\n\nWe should expect capital to make moves that lead to cheaper labor power in the future. Any businessperson will try and abstract over the providers of their inputs; having multiple sellers for an input detracts from their ability to extract monopoly rents. Socialists push this idea even further: unemployment is actually an essential trait of capitalism. There’s a concept introduced by Engels and expanded upon by Marx: the reserve army of labor:\n\nBig industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of overproduction. The main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is, of course, to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible, which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it, i.e., when the overpopulation is the greatest.\n\nThese unemployed workers can be called up when needed for production. When they are not employed, they serve the use of giving capitalists an easy and powerful BATNA when negotiating with an employee: hire another unemployed, potentially desperate worker instead. The presence of unemployed workers reduces all our wages.\n\nThe economist Michał Kalecki took this even farther: the threat of unemployment and the reserve army of labor are essential tools for capitalists to discipline the workforce. Although “full employment” would increase the rate at which capital and labor-power are mixed into more capital, thus increasing returns on capital , full employment would also mean losing the disciplinary tools capital needs to effectively manage a workforce. He writes that full employment\n\nwould cause social and political changes which would give a new impetus to the opposition of the business leaders. The “sack” would cease to play its role as a disciplinary measure. The social position of the boss would be undermined, and the self-assurance and class-consciousness of the working class would grow. . . . “Discipline in the factories” and “political stability” are more appreciated than profits by business leaders. Their class instinct tells them that lasting full employment is unsound from their point of view, and that unemployment is an integral part of the “normal” capitalist system.\n\nI don’t know if the concept of a class instinct is explored rigorously. I suspect a class instinct appears when we discuss a UBI, like Andrew Yang’s modest Freedom Dividend. Workers might imagine what $1,000/month would mean to their families, while bosses who pay $7.25/hour might wonder if their employees will stop taking shifts. The class instinct also captures something true to me: there is never a smoke-filled room where the cabal of capitalists decides the future of the world. Instead, it is always a system of filters and subtle nudges. To me, reasoning about a class having aspirations works on an aesthetic level, the way a paintbrush might want to make a particular stroke or a Python function might want to have a particular signature.\n\nIf there was ever an industry where capitalists felt the first pangs of losing ground to workers for their scarce skills, tech is it. If capital is smart, it will find ways to disempower workers, lest the nascent tech worker movement gain more ground. Disciplining brilliant but unruly software engineers, newly homebound, with a threat of outsourcing their jobs suddenly feels a lot more possible.\n\nIf we look deeply into the tech industry, we realize it’s hard to put everyone into the category of capitalist or worker. Is the lowest level of manager really a capitalist even if their reports might make more money or be higher-level than them? Does an entry-level associate VC really have the same interests as a factory owner?\n\nErik Olin Wright proposes a resolution to these questions: “Highly educated professionals, managers, and many self-employed people, for example, occupy what I have called contradictory locations within class relations and have quite complex and often inconsistent interests with respect to capitalism.”\n\nThis contradictory class location shows up among highly-paid workers and managers, but there’s an argument to be made that even executives and investors have capital-aligning and capital-opposing interests. I argue that by manipulating these capital-aligned classes of people, capital is instinctually able to direct the development of technology towards ends that will lead to greater returns on capital.\n\nHere’s a quick sketch of the tech ecosystem: Holders of capital have one goal: the highest-possible returns on that capital. These banks, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, or family offices hand over their funds to venture capitalists who they expect to make high returns. These investors look around the technology industry and the market to evaluate what kinds of businesses they should fund. Then they hand over those funds to founders who run firms that hire workers with those funds. Ultimately the customers (ad buyers or purchasers of the firm’s products) pay into the firm, and the wealth trickles back up the chain to the holders of capital.\n\nYou can see that the banks and the investors have a lot of power here. Competition between founders for scarce investments means that founders are subject to discipline from investors in a way similar to how workers are disciplined by managers and owners. I don’t want to get into the notion that founders are “exploited”, as they are ultimately much more aligned with capital than with workers, but there is clearly something there.\n\nWhat I’d rather talk about is how investors use this disciplinary power to steer technological development towards technologies that will end up giving recurring returns to capital. Today there is a ton of investment going into machine learning startups. The hope for a ML founder is that they create a machine learning technology company that is immensely valuable; that many customers want to pay them for their product, whether it’s a self-driving car or an algorithm hosted in the cloud. What does the investor hope for? That they’ve invested in not just one 1000x hit company, but in a whole sector that is going to win returns (you often see VC firms investing in companies competing within a space). With a technology like machine learning (or miniaturization, or developer tooling, or lots and lots of things), we see accelerating returns on the technology itself: the more we collectively do ML, the better we collectively get at ML. Machine learning is a technology with the potential to massively shift the balance of power from labor towards capital by automating away jobs and pushing more workers down towards precarity. As a class, investors have to be ecstatic about the potential of machine learning. Already threatening workers with offshoring, now capitalists increasingly threaten workers with ML-powered automation.\n\nAnother product area I think exhibits this capitalist class instinct is smart home technology. Over the years, we are seeing more and more cameras (and other sensors) appear in our houses. First on our computers and phones, now on our Portals and Echos and our workout smart mirrors. These devices have the potential to be major sources of data for machine learning systems to understand and target consumer behavior. And eroding the norms against being surveilled in the home will, in aggregate, give corporations access to more and more data over time.\n\nNow, absolutely no product manager is saying “I want to monetize the data collected from this camera we sell to families to stay in touch.” No founder or investor is bragging that customers are inviting ad networks into their bedrooms, because that’s not what’s happening. But, as a class, is capital smart enough to understand that more cameras mean more data which will mean more returns a decade down the line? If so, its agents can choose to fund the AR headsets, smart mirrors, and video units that will put more sensors in more homes over time. If an investor wants more sensors in the home, they can hold out for founders that are willing to build firms around products that offer such sensors. And when the firm fails to find sufficient returns by selling a product to an end-user, the investor can discipline that founder and force them to monetize the data they’re collecting, or replace them with an executive that will. Down the line, the capitalists will find synergies between their investments in smart homes, behavior-tracking ML systems, and ad delivery networks.\n\nThis is getting handwavey and I’m not even 100% sure about class instincts, so I’ll leave it at that–the technology that gets built is the technology that will produce returns for capital, and capital (sometimes) takes the long view.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

agony of eros: dating - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/the-agony-of-eros-dating?s=r","content":"This is the first post in a series where I explore how love hurts and why. I’ve been in a relationship for a while, but before that I dated for several years and experienced it both as 1) really fun and 2) terrible psychological torment. Lately dating videos on TikTok, Rethinking Sex by Christine Emba, this post by Oliver Traldi, The Agony of Eros by Byung-Chul Han, and Why Love Hurts by Eva Illouz have made me think about why people seem to find the modern dating market so unsatisfying.\n\nI’ve noticed that most people have a hard time 1) optimizing for and 2) implicitly/explicitly asking for what they actually want. Here’s my perception of how dating works for most (heteronormative, I’m not claiming to have insight into anything else) people in their 20s:\n\nYou use Hinge/Raya or serendipitously meet someone cute at party.\n\nYou go on a first date, probably at a cafe, a bar, or dinner, and talk to the person for 1 to 4 hours. You learn about shared interests, job, which college they went to, their friend group. You may or may not learn what they’re “looking for.” If given, the description of what they want usually falls into one of three categories, with the third being the most common—1) I’m not looking for something serious 2) I’m looking for a serious partner and 3) what I’m looking for changes depending on how much I like you, let’s wait and see.\n\nGiven that you’re both attracted to each other, you might kiss on the first or the second date. Given that you match the social norms of my friend group (interested in spirituality but not religious) you will have sex sometime between the first and sixth date.\n\nYou’ll see the person somewhere between once a week to 4x a week. Frequency, the type of date (is it coming-over-at-10-PM or ice skating followed by a medium-nice dinner?), and your respective enthusiasm displayed while texting/scheduling signals your level of interest and seriousness\n\nAt some point, either because it naturally feels right or because you can’t wait any longer, one of you will bring up the “What do you want from this?” conversation.\n\nIt is normal and acceptable for the person to break things off without explanation or even ghost you at any point before there’s a verbal commitment (“Let’s be exclusive or you’re my boyfriend/girlfriend”). After there is a verbal commitment there is an expectation of a conversation when breaking up.\n\nHere are some of the ways these norms cause suffering:\n\nOn TikTok, women in particular complain that men signal emotional seriousness that they don’t actually feel (he said he wanted to introduce me to his family, I met all of his friends, but he still ghosted me a month in ), possibly because they want sex/intimacy without commitment.\n\nWhen someone is not communicative about their desires, the other person often doesn’t have the communication skills to ask what’s going on, and instead spends lots of time wondering about their motivations ( she didn’t text me back, does that mean she’s not interested or she’s just busy? He says he’s not looking for something serious because he just came out of a long-term relationship, but we’ve been hanging out five times a week).\n\nRelated but separate from 2): people are often afraid of saying what they actually want because they’re afraid of coming off as desperate or clingy ( I really like this person, but I’m scared that if I tell them they’ll be like “whoa, this is too much too soon” ).\n\nExclusivity is rarely presumed in the early stages of dating, and any highly desirable potential partner has lots of optionality, so you’ll likely be terrified the person you like will meet someone else they like more, or likes you but doesn’t like you enough to commit.\n\nWe expect more from our partners than ever before—we want them to be our true love, our best friend, our coparenting partner, and the person we combine our finances with. At the same time, switching costs are pretty low (if you’re not happy with your partner you can break up with them with relatively low social costs compared to any other point in history).\n\nLove is a neurochemical con job , i.e. people are more delusional about dating than they are about anything else ( this person clearly acts like they don’t value me, but because I’m super in love with them I’m going to convince myself that they do return my feelings and it’s only a matter of time before they start treating me with love and respect ). More on this in the second post in this series, which will focus on limerence .\n\nDating is horribly unfair. Some people can be with anyone, some people can’t be with anyone they want. Most people are somewhere in the middle. Seeing the disparity can create intense resentment, and if you feel like you’re not measuring up it’s hard to get feedback on what the actual problem is. For ex, if you’re a guy you might blame your height or income, and if you’re a woman you might blame your physical attractiveness. But it’s probably a holistic issue (i.e. you’re medium attractive, but you’re super socially awkward). So maybe instead of getting plastic surgery you should work on your social skills, but obviously improving your social skills is a non-trivial multi-year pursuit, and you might not be self-aware enough to realize that’s the problem in the first place.\n\nAt the same time, people don’t understand that optionality in dating is very different from the ability to date successfully , i.e. you can be very attractive and therefore have a wide range of people interested in you but not have the social skills/psychological acuity to translate initial interest into a successful relationship.\n\nBecause dating is so difficult, there’s a huge market around “dating advice” for both men and women. All of the resources tend to center around following rules as a substitute for 1) having self-awareness and 2) being a good communicator. For ex, PUA advice will say, women like dominant men, so you should frame all your conversations with them in this particular way. “The Rules” type of advice will say something like , it’s important to not seem needy, so if you double text him you might as well kill yourself . Is this advice helpful? In my opinion: yes, sometimes, especially for people who struggle with understanding (admittedly opaque and frustrating) dating norms. Like, you probably shouldn’t text someone who hasn’t replied to you six times, because they might become legitimately scared of you. And it’s obviously true that women are socialized to be less assertive than men when dating, so if your strategy is to wait until a girl asks you out, that will work with a minority of women but not the majority. But the thing that’s really hard about dating is that it tends to bring out all your attachment issues, problems you’ve inherited from your parents, primal fear of rejection, etc so it’s really, really hard (basically impossible) to fake being different than you are. Anyone who’s tried to pretend they’re indifferent to someone they actually really, really like knows exactly what I mean. Your true self always slips out.\n\nI think there are two emotional factors to dating being less awful (sorry, I don’t have enough space in this post to dive into appearance, charisma, or status lol), both of which are easier to describe than to achieve:\n\nSelf-awareness: how can you go after what you want if you don’t know what you want?\n\nTactful honesty. Two tweets about this:\n\nTo illustrate both 1) and 2), I’ll use the example of when to have sex . Okay, so clearly it’s true that both having sex in the bathroom of a bar the first night you meet and having sex one year into a committed relationship has produced successful marriages. But do you understand which side of the spectrum you yourself are on? My argument is that our culture doesn’t encourage people to pay attention to their feelings enough to know (self-awareness!). Most people turn to frameworks: either I’m religious, so I’ll wait until marriage , or I don’t think sex is sacred, so I guess I’m open to casual sex. But I think some of what Christine Emba writes about is that your personal emotional response to sex is actually important? And that perhaps it’s partially your partner’s responsibility to be cognizant of that but it is most your responsibility to figure out whether it makes you feel terrible? Which is hard, because we live in a culture that completely destroys people’s ability to be attuned to their emotions? Like, if you’ve ever met a poor soul who’s horribly in love with their quote-unquote friend with benefits and tries to convince you that they’re okay with the situation even though it’s obvious that they’re being psychologically tortured by it, you know what I’m describing. My dream world is one in which more people could communicate things like, I don’t want to have sex with you even though I’m attracted to you because I’m going to feel emotionally attached to you after the fact and I want to wait until I have sufficient context to understand whether you’re actually someone I want to be attached to (tactful honesty!). Oliver Traldi:\n\nEmba is correct that there is a deep social confusion about the meaning of sex: it cannot be both a meaningless encounter we sign up for with a swipe and a high-stakes enterprise that contains the potential both for great intimacy and for deep hurt and violation.\n\nIt also seems to me that people know what they want but they rarely know what they need. As in, they have an idea of what kind of partner would be attractive to them, mostly based on some amalgamation of qualities they find sexually attractive, qualities that their social group values, and qualities that would flatter their ego. But they don’t necessarily know what a great emotional connection feels like.\n\nFor ex: someone might say, what I want is a guy who’s athletic, has a stable job, wants to have children, good relationship with his family, is funny and emotionally aware . I don’t think lists like that are helpful, because you’re probably subconsciously filtering based on those qualities anyway. The real thing people should be actively looking for is strong emotional connection, as in: to what degree can I share who I am with this person, do they get it , how interested are they in who I am, my feelings and thoughts, can we accommodate each other’s preferences, are we good at talking. Once I asked a very happy couple how they knew they were the right for other and the woman said, Well, we were both just really good communicators. And that’s rare. And I was like, wow, it is so rare! I think what I want more than anything else is someone who’s a really phenomenal communicator. How is it that I never noticed that? And doesn't that mean I should try to become an excellent communicator? When I was in my late teens or early 20s I would sometimes be in the early stages of dating someone and feel like there was a glass wall between us, I just didn’t really get them, I didn’t know what they wanted from me, and it was so hard for me to have any clarity about who they really are. But I would be like, well, objectively this person is hot and smart and cool. So why wouldn’t I want to date them? Answer: because you can’t really talk to them, dumbass.\n\nSome of that disconnect was due to compatibility, but some of it was due to my own bad communication. It takes so much practice to get good articulating the deep sentiment behind the shallow one. Another learning moment was when I heard an acquaintance on the phone with a girl he was seeing. She lived in a different country, and he was explaining that he thought he should cancel his upcoming visit because he’d decided that he didn’t want a serious and committed relationship with her. She said that that was fine and he should come anyway, she wanted to see him. And he said, Well, I don’t really know if we’re on the same page. I feel like you’re verbally agreeing with me but you actually hope that if I come visit you might change my mind . I was impressed by his ability to say the subtext out loud. Most of us stop at the obvious thing : she said it was fine, I like her, why shouldn’t I visit? But I think it’s only when we’re able to communicate the precise observation, the actual feeling, that we can make real progress.\n\nBut it’s hard, it’s so hard, because we’re not taught how to ask hard questions of both ourselves and others. We believe that social reality is more important than individual reality, that being with someone who makes you look good is better than being with someone who makes you feel good. And we live in a time where we have more optionality and less transparency than ever before, where changing social norms have created highly competitive marriage markets (more on this later).

we stopped making Einsteins - by Erik Hoel","link":"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins?s=r","content":"I think the most depressing fact about humanity is that during the 2000s most of the world was handed essentially free access to the entirety of knowledge and that didn’t trigger a golden age.\n\nThink about the advent of the internet long enough and it seems impossible to not start throwing away preconceptions about how genius is produced. If genius were just a matter of genetic ability, then in the past century, as the world’s population increased dramatically, and as mass education skyrocketed, and as racial and gender barriers came thundering down across the globe, and particularly in the last few decades as free information saturated our society, we should have seen a genius boom—an efflorescence of the best mathematicians, the greatest scientists, the most awe-inspiring artists.\n\nIf a renaissance be too grand for you, will you at least admit we should have expected some sort of a bump?\n\nAnd yet, this great real-world experiment has seen, not just no effect, but perhaps the exact opposite effect of a decline of genius. Consider how rare true world-historic geniuses are now-a-days, and how different it was in the past. In “ Where Have All the Great Books Gone? ” Tanner Greer uses Oswald Spengler, the original chronicler of the decline of genius back in 1914, to point out our current genius downturn.\n\n[Spengler] repeatedly describes Tolstoy (d. 1910), Ibsen (d. 1906), Nietzsche (d. 1900), Hertz (d. 1894), Dostoevsky (d. 1881), Marx (d. 1883), and Maxwell (1879) as figures of defining “world-historical” importance: in other words, as working on the same plane as Plato, Archimedes, Ovid, Shakespeare, and Newton. He does not argue their merits; to him it is obvious that these are the men who deserve to be thought of as “world-historical” figures, and it is clear from the way he makes his arguments that he expects that his own readers already agree with him.\n\nPonder that! Spengler began writing Decline of the West in 1914. Tolstoy was only four years dead when Spengler started his book; Marx was only 30 years deceased. But Spengler could state, with the full expectation that his audience would not question him, that these men belonged in global pantheon of humanity’s greatest figures. But Spengler was hardly alone in this sort of judgement. Ten years later John Erskine would teach his course on the great works of the Western tradition—which was the granddaddy of the Columbia Common Core, the St. John’s curriculum, and the Great Books of the Western World series—and it included all of the names mentioned above as well. To this Erskine would add the names William James, Sigmund Freud, Thomas Hardy, and Charles Darwin. . .\n\nIs there anyone who died in the last decade you could make that sort of claim for?\n\nHow about for the last two decades?\n\nThe last three?\n\nOr is there anyone at all who is still living today that might be described this way?\n\nIf you disagree, I’ll certainly admit that finding irrefutable evidence for a decline of genius is difficult—intellectual contributions are extremely hard to quantify, the definition of genius is always up for debate, and any discussion will necessarily elide all sorts of points and counterpoints. But the numbers, at least at first glance, seem to support the anecdotal. Here’s a chart from Cold Takes’ “ Where’s Today’s Beethoven? ” Below, we can see the number of acclaimed scientists (in blue) and artists (in red), divided by the effective population (total human population with the education and access to contribute to these fields).\n\nThis particular dataset ends at 1950, but the downward trend is clear. And Strange Loop Canon put together this graph of geniuses based on Wikipedia mentions.\n\nThese charts don’t even quantify the effective population explosion that the internet represented (and its unsettling concomitant lack of a genius boom).\n\nOne might, of course, reply that there are still many Einsteins, they just don’t come off as Einsteins because ideas are so much harder to find now. This “ideas are getting harder to find” argument does indeed have some data to support it , although not everyone agrees . Yet, even if ideas are getting harder to find (to some degree), does it actually fully explain our dearth of geniuses? Surely, ideas didn’t get harder to find in the last twenty-five years to exactly such a degree it completely nullified the explosion of free information to pretty much everyone on Earth? And “ideas are getting harder to find” seems especially unconvincing outside the hard sciences in domains like music or fiction.\n\nWe may be uncomfortable with it being pointed out, but the absence of genius is a major problem. Global cultural and intellectual exhaustion are an existential risk to the longterm viability of humanity. Geniuses prevent that from happening; they renew us, rejuvenate and reinvigorate us. We shouldn’t be shy about it.\n\nSo, where are all the Einsteins?\n\nThe answer must lie in education somewhere. And if we look into research on different education strategies and their effectiveness, we do indeed see all sorts of debates about best practices, learning styles, class size, monetary policy, and equality. But mostly we see, actually, that none of it matters much. Education researcher and fellow Substack writer Freddie deBoer points out that\n\n. . . winning a lottery to attend a supposedly better school in Chicago makes no difference on educational outcomes. In New York? Makes no difference . What determines college completion rates, high school quality? No, that makes no difference ; what matters is “preentry ability.” How about private vs. public schools? Corrected for underlying demographic differences, it makes no difference . Parents in many cities are obsessive about getting their kids into competitive exam high schools, but when you adjust for differences in ability, attending them makes no difference . The kids who just missed the cut score and the kids who just beat it have very similar underlying ability and so it should not surprise us in the least that they have very similar outcomes, despite going to very different schools. (The perception that these schools matter is based on exactly the same bad logic that Harvard benefits from.) Similarly, highly sought-after government schools in Kenya make no difference . Winning the lottery to choose your middle school in China? Makes no difference .\n\nMany have taken this null effect of schools to be a sign of genetic determinism, wherein some innate ability, like IQ, is all that matters, and education is, at best, just the delivery of a repository of facts.\n\nI don’t think this is the case. For paradoxically there exists an agreed-upon and specific answer to the single best way to educate children, a way that has clear, obvious, and strong effects. The problem is that this answer is unacceptable. The superior method of education is deeply unfair and privileges those at the very top of the socioeconomic ladder. It’s an answer that was well-known historically, and is also observed by education researchers today: tutoring.\n\nTutoring, one-on-one instruction, dramatically improves student’s abilities and scores. In education research this effect is sometimes called “ Bloom’s 2-sigma problem ” because in the 1980s the researcher Benjamin Bloom found that tutored students\n\n. . performed two standard deviations better than students who learn via conventional instructional methods—that is, \"the average tutored student was above 98% of the students in the control class.”\n\nHowever, despite its well-known effectiveness, tutoring’s modern incarnation almost universally concerns specific tests: in America the Advanced Placements (AP) tests, the SATs, and the GREs form the holy trinity of private tutoring. Meaning that contemporary tutoring, the most effective method of education, is overwhelmingly targeted at a small set of measurables that look good on a college resume.\n\nThis is only a narrow version of the tutoring that was done historically. If we go back in time tutoring had a much broader scope, acting as the main method of early education, at least for the elite.\n\nLet us call this past form aristocratic tutoring, to distinguish it from a tutor you meet in a coffeeshop to go over SAT math problems while the clock ticks down. It’s also different than “tiger parenting,” which is specifically focused around the resume padding that’s needed for kids to meet the impossible requirements for high-tier colleges. Aristocratic tutoring was not focused on measurables. Historically, it usually involved a paid adult tutor, who was an expert in the field, spending significant time with a young child or teenager, instructing them but also engaging them in discussions, often in a live-in capacity, fostering both knowledge but also engagement with intellectual subjects and fields. As the name suggests it was something reserved mostly for aristocrats, which means, no way around it, it was deeply inequitable.\n\nIt’s a tradition that goes back as far as one can find. For example, consider one of the greatest statesmen of all time and one of the few true philosopher-kings, the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Will Durant, in The Story of Civilization: Vol III, Caesar and Christ, said of Aurelius’s education that:\n\nNever was a boy so persistently educated. . . Marcus liked games and sports, even bird snaring and hunting, and some efforts were made to train his body as well as his mind and character. But seventeen tutors in childhood are a heavy handicap. Four grammarians, four rhetors, one jurist, and eight philosophers divided his soul among them. The most famous of these teachers was M. Cornelius Fronto, who taught him rhetoric . . . Marcus love him, lavished upon him all the kindnesses of an affectionate and royal pupil, and exchanged with him letters of intimate charm. . .\n\nSpanning kingdoms and continents aristocratic tutoring had a several-millennia long run. If we fast forward almost 2,000 years we can find Bertrand Russell, one of the undeniable geniuses of the 20th century, who was a classic case of aristocratic tutoring—raised by his rich grandparents, he didn’t even attend school until he was 16 , and had a revolving door of tutors to equal Marcus’s. Many of whom were impressive scientists and intellectuals in their own right, e.g., J. Stuart, one of Russell’s tutors, had himself been a student of Lord Kelvin (that “ Kelvin ”). Russell, thanks to his detailed autobiography, gives us a clear impression of what aristocratic tutoring was like. Here’s from the graphic novel adaption of Russell’s life, Logicomix :\n\nThe same sort of idyllic learning situation was true for Russell’s famous compatriot, Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was privately tutored at home until he was 14. Name a genius and find a tutor: the governesses of John von Neumann taught him languages, and he had other later tutors as well. Even in the cases where the children weren’t entirely homeschooled, up until the latter half of the 20th century aristocratic tutors were a casual and constant supplement to traditional education. Consider the easy nature by which Darwin, at the age of only 16 and already in university, personally hired John Edmonstone, a former slave and black freedman, to give him lessons on taxidermy outside of his classes (lessons later key to his specimen collections on The Beagle). The young Darwin described Edmonstone in his letters as someone who\n\n. . . gained his livelihood by stuffing birds, which he did excellently: he gave me lessons for payment, and I used often to sit with him, for he was a very pleasant and intelligent man.\n\nWhen you go back further, into the 1600s and 1700s, aristocratic tutors are the norm, often members of the aristocracy themselves. Voltaire’s tutor when he was young was the educated and worldly abbe de Chateauneuf, who was also his godfather. In turn, Voltaire was tutor to Émilie du Châtelet, an early female scientist and mathematician (notorious for her harsh demands of her tutors). Ada Lovelace, inventor of the first algorithm, was tutored as a youth by Mary Somerville, another early female scientist (indeed, the term “scientist” was coined specifically to refer to Somerville in a gender-neutral way, rather than the previously-used “man of science”).\n\nThe great philosopher himself, Descartes, literally died from tutoring—at the age of 53 he was giving lessons to Queen Christiana at the ungodly hour of 5 A.M., and the morning walk to the cold castle (which he hated) gave him pneumonia. But most of the time life as a tutor was essentially a cushy patronage job, wherein you instilled a sense of intellectual discovery into a young child in return for a hefty salary that left most of your free time intact—surely that’s what the tutors living on the Tolstoy estate must have felt, whiling away the evening hours chasing the local peasant girls after educating the young writer in the morning.\n\nIndeed, it’s remarkable how common aristocratic tutors were. Essentially universal. You may have heard of the Grand Tour that young European aristocrats took part in , traveling from country to country, visiting universities and partaking of the various cultures and cuisines and sights. But did you know the young aristocrats always took their tutors along with them?\n\nThe young man (or woman) would not be traveling alone. Often it was the tutor who had already spent time educating the boy that was attached to the youngster in his (or her) travels. It could also be a specially appointed traveling tutor who was to supervise the journey.\n\nPerhaps the clearest example in history of a genius constructed by tutoring comes from the case of John Stuart Mill: philosopher, economist, politician, early feminist, and all-around Renaissance man. His father, already a famous intellectual, raised John explicitly to be a genius capable of carrying on the cause of philosophical utilitarianism, purposefully keeping the young John away from children his own age. The result was:\n\nStarting with Greek at age three and Latin at age eight, Mill had absorbed most of the classical canon by age twelve—along with algebra, Euclid, and the major Scottish and English historians. In his early teenage years, he studied political economy, logic, and calculus, utilising his spare time to digest treatises on experimental science as an amusement. At age fifteen—upon returning from a year-long trip to France, a nation he would eventually call home—he started work on the major treatises of philosophy, psychology and government. All this was conducted under the strict daily supervision of his father. . .\n\nThis last part is a common pattern: the line between parent and tutor is often a blurry one, and it is precisely in this way that the aristocratic style of tutoring sometimes bled into the lives of the non-aristocratic. Karl Marx’s father (who was rich enough to own vineyards) privately tutored him up to the age of 12, his official schooling starting only after. Or consider the later case of Hannah Arendt, a titan of 20th century philosophy; raised upper-middle class and Jewish in Germany during the rise of Hitler, she was no aristocrat, but she received independent tutoring from rabbis and professors at various points in her young life, and, perhaps far more relevantly, her own mother acted in the role of a classic aristocratic tutor :\n\nHannah Arendt's mother, who considered herself progressive, sought to raise her daughter along strict Goethean lines, which amongst other things, involved the reading of the complete works of Goethe. . . Goethe, at the time, was considered the essential mentor of Bildung (education), the conscious formation of mind, body and spirit. . . Hannah's developmental progress (Entwicklung) was carefully documented by her mother in a book, which she titled Unser Kind (Our Child) and measured her against the benchmark of what was then considered normale Entwicklung (\"normal development\").\n\nAnother example of a case where parents acted as aristocratic tutors: Virginia Woolf. While Woolf famously did not get a formal education, she was instead rigorously homeschooled .\n\nWhile she was growing up, Woolf did not attend school. However, she had a tutor who educated her in English literature and the classics. Her father took an interest in her education as well, and giving Woolf and her siblings private lessons in which he recommended literature and worked on improving their writing.\n\nWith these examples in mind, it’s likely that at a significant contributing factor for the phenomenon of genius running in families is that genius family members act as aristocratic tutors, encouraging learning, the life of the mind, and inculcating the pursuit of the higher mysteries in the young. When Bertrand Russell’s older brother introduced him to geometry at the age of 11, Russell later wrote in his autobiography that it was:\n\n. . . one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love.\n\nIs that really solely his innate genetic facility, or was mathematics colored by the love of his older brother?\n\nRecently I was discussing with a friend the hypothesis that aristocratic tutoring (of the kind we don’t do anymore) is the only known consistent method to at least occasionally produce geniuses, to which he objected “What about Einstein?” A great point. Einstein’s reputation makes him seem one the most democratic of geniuses, a term he’s synonymous with; Einstein emphasizes the innateness of genius, its capability of coming from anywhere, even a lowly patent clerk. Isn’t there that story of him getting low grades in middle school?\n\nWell, it turns out most of the school stuff is exaggerated or apocryphal, and Einstein had multiple tutors growing up in subjects like mathematics and philosophy, such as his uncle, Jakob Einstein, who taught him algebra. In fact, there was a family tutor of the Einsteins who went by the name Max Talmud (possibly the best name of a tutor ever), and it was indeed Max Talmud who introduced the young 12-year-old Albert to geometry, prefacing young Albert’s eventual transformation of our understanding of space and time into something geometric. Maybe we don’t make Einsteins anymore because we don’t make Max Talmuds anymore.\n\nI’m certainly not saying that aristocratic tutoring is the only path to genius. There are people like Ramanujan, whose father was a clerk, and who was one of the greatest mathematical minds of all time (although I’ll note briefly that his home did lodge college students, who, it’s been suggested, may have acted as informal tutors). Some geniuses weren’t tutored, although verifying an absence is surprisingly difficult; tutoring is often not deigned to be mentioned except in detailed biographies. Certainly though, it appears that would-be-genius children had extremely abnormal amounts of one-on-one time with intellectually-inclined adults, who often introduced them to advanced topics far beyond their age. Once you begin looking, tutors pop up like mushrooms around historical geniuses.\n\nThe traditional line for why essentially all intellectuals used to be aristocrats is that they were the only people with the leisure time to pursue the life of the mind. But what if it was never solely about leisure, but also a style of education that has fallen out of favor?\n\nFor the decrease in genius sure does seem to coincide with the end of the aristocracy. Europe looms large in the history of geniuses, and for many reasons, but perhaps also its centuries-long tradition of tutored aristocracies. And this stretched quite late into the modern age. For instance, if I were forced at gunpoint to name the two greatest minds of the 20th century, I’d pick Bertrand Russell and John von Neumann. Is it really a coincidence that both were basically aristocrats? “Von” is, after all, a title. They were relics, anachronisms in a century that was shamefully and rapidly moving away from their kind. Aliens from an older world.\n\nNow consider our current situation. Despite all the language professing otherwise, in general the education system of the United States is based entirely on genetic determinism. A child is born assumed to have innate traits, including, for example, a preference as to what they want to be when they grow up (somehow just waiting fully-formed inside of their six-year-old selves). Then they are thrown into the school system, a competitive academic meritocracy wrapped in an obtuse hierarchical bureaucracy, a structure in which they will spend most of their young adult life, forced to learn mostly from their peers, who know as little as they do. Those who can’t sit through it are given drugs until they can. If they happen to test well or their parents spend the money, they might end up in slightly smaller classes, and with slightly better teachers, and with slightly smarter peers, but the structure will be the same. The first real intellectuals that most children meet in person are their college professors—already at eighteen and stuck in a class with dozens of other people (even at Harvard, introductory courses are often in the hundreds). Is it any surprise that such methods don’t reliably produce geniuses? Is it not anathema to how humans normally become interested in things? We sequestered children from great minds, and, perhaps it’s worth briefly noting, we also sequestered great minds from children.\n\nToday, tutoring is seen mostly as a corrective to failures within the bureaucratic structures of eduction, like an intervention to help out a course, grade, or test. In general, those doing well in school don’t get tutoring—it’s like we’re applying the secret genius sauce solely to the kids who aren’t going to be geniuses.\n\nMight technology swoop in to the rescue once more? Perhaps aristocratic tutoring doesn’t have to be solely for aristocrats. Recent research has shown the two-sigma effect of tutoring using AI tutors compared to traditional online courses. Perhaps in the future once could imagine personalized AI governesses and AI tutors. But by then, will we even need human geniuses?\n\nReturning to now, while online courses are growing in popularity, the grand experiment that was the introduction of the internet tells us that access to information counts for little in producing genius—perhaps almost nothing. As great as YouTube math tutorials are, they themselves haven’t triggered a golden age of mathematicians. Instead, what’s necessary for genius historically is early engagement with, not access to, intellectual subjects. And, for humans, engagement is a social phenomenon; particularly for children, this requires interactions with adults who can not just give them individual attention, but also model for them what serious intellectual engagement looks like. Think of how influential the in-his-twenties Max Talmud must have seemed to a preteen Einstein, handing him great books by the likes of Spinoza and Euclid.\n\nCould you hire a Max Talmud for your own family? I can certainly imagine a start-up specializing in online aristocratic tutoring, geared not toward tests or college resume padding but toward fundamentals, completely orthogonal to the norm of academic mass-production. This would actually fit in with some of other recent movements, like the “ slow food ” movement. There has already been a significant rise in homeschooling and even “unschooling” (which sounds like something that could, in some cases, essentially be parental-driven aristocratic tutoring). Yet, for such a start-up the problem is obvious: tutoring highlights economic privilege. And as Tocqueville pointed out, the rejection of aristocracy is a foundation of the American ethos. It’s telling I felt uncomfortable writing this essay, despite being confident it’s true.\n\nSo, even if costs were reachable for the upper-middle class, would such a system be allowed to exist?\n\nNot everything improves with time. There are a number of things that people did better in the past, both because of lost wisdom but also simply because in the past things weren’t mass-produced. Beautiful older dresses, hand-stitched rugs, even kitchen appliances used to be sturdier and last longer. You can go purchase a mass-produced cheap samurai sword online, but you’d be a fool to use it in a fight against a blade of 20-times folded steel, even if the latter were ancient. Stradivari violins, hand-crafted by members of the Italian Stradivari family, are legendarily considered to have a superior and unique sound compared to violins made with even the most modern techniques.\n\nA child going from governesses teaching them multiple languages to renowned scholars tutoring them in advanced mathematics is similarly not replicable in today’s world. In turning education into a system of mass production we created a superbly democratic system that made the majority of people, and the world as a whole, much better off. It was the right decision. But we lost the most elegant and beautiful minds, those mental Stradivari, who were created via an artisanal process.\n\nThe unfortunate consequence is that, in a very real sense, our intellectual culture is filled with figures who are essentially mass-produced ersatz knock-offs of their aristocratic forebearers.

Center","link":"https://www.recurse.com/social-rules","content":"RC has four social rules. They help create a friendly, intellectual environment where you can spend as much of your energy as possible on programming.\n\nThe social rules name subtle behaviors that put other people down or show how much we know instead of supporting each other’s learning. They work together with the self-directives to make RC an even better place to learn and grow.\n\nFor example, working at the edge of your abilities requires taking emotional risks, and the social rules help create an environment where it’s safe to do that. Letting someone know that they impacted you by breaking a social rule and accepting that feedback gracefully when you’re the one who messed up are important ways to learn generously. This allows everyone to keep working and growing together.\n\nOne thing that often surprises people about the social rules is that we expect people to break them from time to time. This means they’re different from our code of conduct , which covers behaviors that are never acceptable, like abuse, discrimination, and harassment.\n\nAlice: I just installed Linux on my computer!\n\nA well-actually is when you correct someone about something that’s not relevant to the conversation or tangential to what they’re trying to say. They’re bad because they aren’t helpful, break the flow of conversation, and focus attention on the person making the well actually.\n\nThis rule can be a bit tricky because there isn’t a clear line between relevant to the conversation and not. Sometimes your correction might actually be necessary, and it could still come off as annoying when you make it. The best rule of thumb is, if you’re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens. You can always say it later if it turns out there’s no way for the conversation to move forward without your correction.\n\nCarol: Wait, you’ve never used the command line?\n\nFeigned surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn’t know something. Responding with surprise in this situation makes people feel bad for not knowing things and less likely to ask questions in the future, which makes it harder for them to learn.\n\nNo feigning surprise isn’t a great name. When someone acts surprised when you don’t know something, it doesn’t matter whether they’re pretending to be surprised or actually surprised. The effect is the same: the next time you have a question, you’re more likely to keep your mouth shut. An accurate name for this rule would be no acting surprised when someone doesn’t know something, but it’s a mouthful, and at this point, the current name has stuck.\n\nBob: What’s the name of the string copy function?\n\nEve: (from across the room) You should use strlcpy. It’s safer.\n\nBackseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room (or across the online chat) without really joining or engaging in a conversation. Because you haven’t been participating in the conversation, it’s easy to miss something important and give advice that’s not actually helpful. Even if your advice is correct, it’s rude to bust into a conversation without asking. If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join.\n\nCarol: Windows is hard to use.\n\nBob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it.\n\nSubtle -isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice. They are small things that make others feel unwelcome, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. Subtle -isms make people feel like they don’t belong at RC. We want to create an environment where everyone can focus all their energy on programming. It’s hard to do that if you’re regularly being made to wonder whether you belong.\n\nSubtle -isms can also be things that you do instead of say. This includes things like boxing out the only woman at the whiteboard during a discussion or assuming someone isn’t a programmer because of their race or gender.\n\nThe fourth social rule is more complicated than the others. Not everyone agrees on what constitutes a subtle -ism. Subtle -isms are baked into society in ways that can make them hard to recognize. And not everyone experiences subtle -isms in the same way: subtle homophobia won’t hurt someone who’s straight in the same way it hurts someone who’s gay.\n\nThere’s another part of no subtle -isms: If you see racism, sexism, etc. outside of RC, please don’t bring it in. For example, please don’t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Tech Person Y. Everyone who comes to RC should have the same opportunity to focus on programming, and people from oppressed groups often find discussions of racism, sexism, etc. particularly hard to tune out. There are many places to discuss and debate these issues, but there are few where people can avoid them. RC is one of those places.\n\nThe social rules are lightweight. You should not be afraid of breaking a social rule. These are things that everyone does, and breaking one doesn’t make you a bad person. If someone says, \"hey, you just feigned surprise,\" or \"that’s subtly sexist,\" don’t worry. Just apologize, reflect for a second, and move on.\n\nThe social rules aren’t for punishing people. They help make RC a pleasant environment where you are free to be yourself, tackle things outside your comfort zone, and focus on programming.\n\nThe social rules don’t cover harassment or discrimination. For that, we have a separate code of conduct enforced by the RC faculty. All members of the RC community are expected to abide by our code of conduct.","tokenFrequency":{"anoth":1,"subtl":10,"thing":9,"join":2,"comfort":1,"take":1,"abil":1,"behavior":2,"safer":1,"assum":1,"code":3,"shut":1,"sure":1,"isn't":3,"person":3,"selfdirect":1,"other":3,"overhear":1,"show":1,"mom":1,"exampl":2,"keep":2,"it":6,"mean":1,"rule":13,"made":1,"program":4,"onlin":1,"said":1,"grow":2,"kind":1,"haven't":1,"strlcpi":1,"mistak":1,"lob":1,"relev":2,"clear":1,"work":3,"turn":1,"intellectu":1,"pleas":2,"togeth":2,"you'v":1,"convers":8,"issu":1,"situat":1,"opportun":1,"four":1,"room":2,"time":3,"feel":3,"that":3,"harder":1,"best":2,"backseat":1,"make":10,"abid":1,"safe":1,"know":6,"aren't":2,"carol":2,"risk":1,"prejudic":1,"easi":2,"less":1,"punish":1,"thumb":1,"stuck":1,"communiti":1,"better":1,"respond":1,"advic":3,"break":5,"place":3,"tri":1,"express":1,"conduct":3,"discuss":4,"part":1,"etc":2,"expect":2,"member":1,"comment":1,"outsid":2,"attent":1,"well":1,"say":4,"tune":1,"you'r":4,"alway":1,"see":2,"start":1,"what":1,"enforc":1,"focus":4,"they'r":4,"current":1,"gender":1,"act":3,"belong":2,"unwelcom":1,"might":1,"line":2,"ageism":1,"drive":1,"separ":1,"hurt":2,"great":1,"recogn":1,"ism":7,"homophobia":2,"help":6,"across":3,"happen":1,"necessari":1,"effect":1,"accept":2,"agre":1,"actual":4,"friend":1,"energi":2,"someth":6,"bake":1,"still":1,"bob":2,"right":1,"never":2,"apolog":1,"question":2,"one":4,"instead":2,"whether":3,"accur":1,"everyon":6,"":22,"racism":3,"often":2,"surpris":10,"transphobia":1,"come":2,"command":1,"string":1,"tackl":1,"creat":3,"grace":1,"avoid":1,"fourth":1,"rude":1,"annoy":1,"oppress":1,"window":2,"edg":1,"pleasant":1,"discrimin":2,"generous":1,"bring":1,"use":5,"later":1,"possibl":1,"someon":9,"alic":1,"social":10,"function":1,"don't":6,"want":1,"rc":9,"wellactu":1,"eve":1,"point":1,"ask":3,"hold":1,"gay":1,"won't":1,"copi":1,"faculti":1,"harass":2,"free":1,"next":1,"mess":1,"much":2,"worri":1,"move":2,"societi":1,"instal":1,"spend":1,"learn":4,"who":2,"also":1,"need":1,"pretend":1,"constitut":1,"linux":1,"futur":1,"subt":1,"reflect":1,"find":1,"zone":1,"would":1,"wonder":1,"includ":1,"forward":1,"wait":1,"import":2,"sexist":1,"impact":1,"tech":1,"bit":1,"matter":1,"random":1,"doesn't":4,"complic":1,"second":1,"cover":2,"bad":3,"sexism":3,"particular":1,"afraid":1,"like":5,"comput":1,"whiteboard":1,"flow":1,"peopl":8,"mouth":2,"chat":1,"even":3,"regular":1,"differ":1,"programm":1,"latest":1,"feedback":1,"woman":1,"hard":4,"tricki":1,"bias":1,"group":1,"support":1,"there":2,"sometim":2,"without":3,"way":6,"name":5,"abus":1,"could":2,"race":1,"environ":4,"tangenti":1,"straight":1,"offens":1,"let":1,"give":1,"particip":1,"allow":1,"hey":1,"put":1,"miss":1,"lightweight":1,"mani":1,"emot":1,"bust":1,"engag":1,"small":1,"debat":1,"feign":3,"box":1,"correct":4,"requir":1,"experi":1,"realli":1}},"18974":{"id":"18974","title":"How Silicon Valley Broke the Economy | The Nation","link":"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/silicon-valley-history-book-review","content":"One of Apple cofounder Steve Jobs’s most audacious marketing triumphs is rarely mentioned in the paeans to his genius that remain a staple of business content farms. In 1982, Jobs offered to donate a computer to every K–12 school in America, provided Congress pass a bill giving Apple substantial tax write-offs for the donations. When he arrived in Washington, DC, to lobby for what became known as the Apple Bill, the 28-year-old CEO looked “more like a summer intern than the head of a $600-million-a-year corporation,” according to The Washington Post, but he already showed signs of his famous arrogance. He barraged the legislators with white papers and proclaimed that they “would be crazy not to take us up on this.” Jobs knew the strength of his hand: A mania for computer literacy was sweeping the nation as an answer to the competitive threats of globalization and the reescalation of the Cold War’s technology and space races. Yet even as preparing students for the Information Age became a national priority, the Reagan era’s budget cuts meant that few schools could afford a brand-new $2,400 Apple II computer. Books in Review The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America By Margaret O’Mara Buy this book\n\nThe Apple Bill passed the House overwhelmingly but then died in the Senate after a bureaucratic snafu for which Jobs forever blamed Republican Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, then chair of the Finance Committee. Yet all was not lost: A similar bill passed in California, and Apple flooded its home state with almost 10,000 computers. Apple’s success in California gave it a leg up in the lucrative education market as states around the country began to computerize their classrooms. But education was not radically transformed, unless you count a spike in The Oregon Trail–related deaths from dysentery. If anything, those who have studied the rapid introduction of computers into classrooms in the 1980s and ’90s tend to conclude that it exacerbated inequities. Elite students and schools zoomed smoothly into cyberspace, while poorer schools fell further behind, bogged down by a lack of training and resources.\n\nA young, charismatic geek hawks his wares using bold promises of social progress but actually makes things worse and gets extremely rich in the process—today it is easy to see the story of the Apple Bill as a stand-in for the history of the digital revolution as a whole. The growing concern about the role that technology plays in our lives and society is fueled in no small part by a growing realization that we have been duped. We were told that computerizing everything would lead to greater prosperity, personal empowerment, collective understanding, even the ability to transcend the limits of the physical realm and create a big, beautiful global brain made out of electrons. Instead, our extreme dependence on technology seems to have mainly enriched and empowered a handful of tech companies at the expense of everyone else. The panic over Facebook’s impact on democracy sparked by Donald Trump’s election in a haze of fake news and Russian bots felt like the national version of the personal anxiety that seizes many of us when we find ourselves snapping away from our phone for what seems like the 1,000th time in an hour and contemplating how our lives are being stolen by a screen. We are stuck in a really bad system.\n\nThis realization has led to a justifiable anger and derision aimed at the architects of this system. Silicon Valley executives and engineers are taken to task every week in the op-ed pages of our largest newspapers. We are told that their irresponsibility and greed have undermined our freedom and degraded our democratic institutions. While it is gratifying to see tech billionaires get a (very small) portion of their comeuppance, we often forget that until very recently, Silicon Valley was hailed by almost everyone as creating the path toward a brilliant future. Perhaps we should pause and contemplate how this situation came to be, lest we make the same mistakes again. The story of how Silicon Valley ended up at the center of the American dream in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, as well as the ambiguous reality behind its own techno-​utopian dreams, is the subject of Margaret O’Mara’s sweeping new history, The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America. In it, she puts Silicon Valley into the context of a larger story about postwar America’s economic and social transformations, highlighting its connections with the mainstream rather than the cultural quirks and business practices that set it apart. The Code urges us to consider Silicon Valley’s shortcomings as America’s shortcomings, even if it fails to interrogate them as deeply as our current crisis—and the role that technology played in bringing it about—seems to warrant.\n\nSilicon Valley entered the public consciousness in the 1970s as something of a charmed place. The first recorded mention of Silicon Valley was in a 1971 article by a writer for a technology newspaper reporting on the region’s semiconductor industry, which was booming despite the economic doldrums that had descended on most of the country. As the Rust Belt foundered and Detroit crumbled, Silicon Valley soared to heights barely conveyed by the metrics that O’Mara rattles off in the opening pages of The Code: “Three billion smartphones. Two billion social media users. Two trillion-dollar companies” and “the richest people in the history of humanity.” Many people have attempted to divine the secret of Silicon Valley’s success. The consensus became that the Valley had pioneered a form of quicksilver entrepreneurialism perfectly suited to the Information Age. It was fast, flexible, meritocratic, and open to new ways of doing things. It allowed brilliant young people to turn crazy ideas into world-changing companies practically overnight. Silicon Valley came to represent the innovative power of capitalism freed from the clutches of uptight men in midcentury business suits, bestowed upon the masses by a new, appealing folk hero: the cherub-faced start-up founder hacking away in his dorm room.\n\nThe Code both bolsters and revises this story. On the one hand, O’Mara, a historian at the University of Washington, is clearly enamored with tales of entrepreneurial derring-do. From the “traitorous eight” who broke dramatically from the Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in 1957 to start Fairchild Semiconductor and create the modern silicon transistor to the well-documented story of Facebook’s founding, the major milestones of Silicon Valley history are told in heroic terms that can seem gratingly out of touch, given what we know about how it all turned out. In her portrayal of Silicon Valley’s tech titans, O’Mara emphasizes virtuous qualities like determination, ingenuity, and humanistic concern, while hints of darker motives are studiously ignored. We learn that a “visionary and relentless” Jeff Bezos continued to drive a beat-up Honda Accord even as he became a billionaire, but his reported remark to an Amazon sales team that they ought to treat small publishers the way a lion treats a sickly gazelle is apparently not deemed worthy of the historical record. But at the same time, O’Mara helps us understand why Silicon Valley’s economic dominance can’t be chalked up solely to the grit and smarts of entrepreneurs battling it out in the free market. At every stage of its development, she shows how the booming tech industry was aided and abetted by a wide swath of American society both inside and outside the Valley. Marketing gurus shaped the tech companies’ images, educators evangelized for technology in schools, best-selling futurists preached personalized tech as a means toward personal liberation. What emerges in The Code is less the story of a tribe of misfits working against the grain than the simultaneous alignment of the country’s political, cultural, and technical elites around the view that Silicon Valley held the key to the future.\n\nAbove all, O’Mara highlights the profound role that the US government played in Silicon Valley’s rise. At the end of World War II, the region was still the sleepy, sun-drenched Santa Clara Valley, home to farms and orchards, an upstart Stanford University, and a scattering of small electronics and aerospace firms. Then came the space and arms races, given new urgency in 1957 with the launch of Sputnik, which suggested a serious Soviet advantage. Millions of dollars in government funding flooded technology companies and universities around the country. An outsize portion went to Northern California’s burgeoning tech industry, thanks in large part to Stanford’s far-sighted provost Frederick Terman, who reshaped the university into a hub for engineering and the applied sciences.

While these early companies relied on what O’Mara calls the Valley’s “ecosystem” of fresh-faced engineers seeking freedom and sunshine in California, venture capitalists sniffing out a profitable new industry, and lawyers, construction companies, and real estate agents jumping to serve their somewhat quirky ways, she makes it clear that the lifeblood pumping through it all was government money. Fairchild Semiconductor’s biggest clients for its new silicon chips were NASA, which put them in the Apollo rockets, and the Defense Department, which stuck them in Minuteman nuclear missiles. The brains of all of today’s devices have their origin in the United States’ drive to defeat the Soviet Union in the Cold War.\n\nBut the role of public funding in the creation of Silicon Valley is not the big government success story a good liberal might be tempted to consider it. As O’Mara points out, during the Cold War American leaders deliberately pushed public funds to private industry rather than government programs because they thought the market was the best way to spur technological progress while avoiding the specter of centralized planning, which had come to smack of communist tyranny. In the years that followed, this belief in the market as the means to achieve the goals of liberal democracy spread to nearly every aspect of life and society, from public education and health care to social justice, solidifying into the creed we now call neoliberalism. As the role of the state was eclipsed by the market, Silicon Valley—full of brilliant entrepreneurs devising technologies that promised to revolutionize everything they touched—was well positioned to step into the void.\n\nThe earliest start-up founders hardly seemed eager to assume the mantle of social visionary that their successors, today’s flashy celebrity technologists, happily take up. They were buttoned-down engineers who reflected the cool practicality of their major government and corporate clients. As the 1960s wore on, they were increasingly out of touch. Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement and the protests against the Vietnam War, the major concern in Silicon Valley’s manicured technology parks was a Johnson-era drop in military spending. The relatively few techies who were political at the time were conservative.\n\nThings started to change in the 1970s. The ’60s made a belated arrival in the Valley as a younger generation of geeks steeped in countercultural values began to apply them to the development of computer technology. The weight of Silicon Valley’s culture shifted from the conservative suits to long-haired techno-utopians with dreams of radically reorganizing society through technology. This shift was perhaps best embodied by Lee Felsenstein, a former self-described “child radical” who cut his teeth running communications operations for anti-war and civil rights protests before going on to develop the Tom Swift Terminal, one of the earliest personal computers. Felsenstein believed that giving everyday people access to computers could liberate them from the crushing hierarchy of modern industrial society by breaking the monopoly on information held by corporations and government bureaucracies. “To change the rules, change the tools,” he liked to say. Whereas Silicon Valley had traditionally developed tools for the Man, these techies wanted to make tools to undermine him. They created a loose-knit network of hobbyist groups, drop-in computer centers, and DIY publications to share knowledge and work toward the ideal of personal liberation through technology. Their dreams seemed increasingly achievable as computers shrank from massive, room-filling mainframes to the smaller-room-filling minicomputers to, finally, in 1975, the first commercially viable personal computer, the Altair.\n\nYet as O’Mara shows, the techno-utopians did not ultimately constitute such a radical break from the past. While their calls to democratize computing may have echoed Marxist cries to seize the means of production, most were capitalists at heart. To advance the personal computer “revolution,” they founded start-ups, trade magazines, and business forums, relying on funding from venture capital funds often with roots in the old money elite. Jobs became the most celebrated entrepreneur of the era by embodying the discordant figures of both the cowboy capitalist and the touchy-feely hippie, an image crafted in large part by the marketing guru Regis McKenna. Silicon Valley soon became an industry that looked a lot like those that had come before. It was nearly as white and male as they were. Its engineers worked soul-crushing hours and blew off steam with boozy pool parties. And its most successful company, Microsoft, clawed its way to the top through ruthless monopolistic tactics.\n\nPerhaps the strongest case against the supposed subversiveness of the personal computer pioneers is how quickly they were embraced by those in power. As profits rose and spectacular IPOs seized headlines throughout the 1980s, Silicon Valley was championed by the rising stars of supply-side economics, who hitched their drive for tax cuts and deregulation to tech’s venture-capital-fueled rocket ship. The groundwork was laid in 1978, when the Valley’s venture capitalists formed an alliance with the Republicans to kill then-President Jimmy Carter’s proposed increase in the capital gains tax. They beta-​tested Reaganomics by advancing the dubious argument that millionaires’ making slightly less money on their investments might stifle technological innovation by limiting the supply of capital available to start-ups. And they carried the day.\n\nAs president, Ronald Reagan doubled down with tax cuts and wild technophilia. In a truly trippy speech to students at Moscow State University in 1988, he hailed the transcendent possibilities of the new economy epitomized by Silicon Valley, predicting a future in which “human innovation increasingly makes physical resources obsolete.” Meanwhile, the market-friendly New Democrats embraced the tech industry so enthusiastically that they became known, to their chagrin, as Atari Democrats. The media turned Silicon Valley entrepreneurs into international celebrities with flattering profiles and cover stories—living proof that the mix of technological innovation, risk taking, corporate social responsibility, and lack of regulation that defined Silicon Valley in the popular imagination was the template for unending growth and prosperity, even in an era of deindustrialization and globalization.\n\nThe near-universal celebration of Silicon Valley as an avatar of free-market capitalism in the 1980s helped ensure that the market would guide the Internet’s development in the 1990s, as it became the cutting-edge technology that promised to change everything. The Internet began as an academic resource, first as ARPANET, funded and overseen by the Department of Defense, and later as the National Science Foundation’s NSFNET. And while Al Gore didn’t invent the Internet, he did spearhead the push to privatize it: As the Clinton administration’s “technology czar,” he helped develop its landmark National Information Infrastructure (NII) plan, which emphasized the role of private industry and the importance of telecommunications deregulation in constructing America’s “information superhighway.” Not surprisingly, Gore would later do a little-known turn as a venture capitalist with the prestigious Valley firm Kleiner Perkins, becoming very wealthy in the process. In response to his NII plan, the advocacy group Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility warned of a possible corporate takeover of the Internet. “An imaginative view of the risks of an NII designed without sufficient attention to public-interest needs can be found in the modern genre of dystopian fiction known as ‘cyberpunk,’” they wrote. “Cyberpunk novelists depict a world in which a handful of multinational corporations have seized control, not only of the physical world, but of the virtual world of cyberspace.” Who can deny that today’s commercial Internet has largely fulfilled this cyberpunk nightmare? Someone should ask Gore what he thinks.\n\nDespite offering evidence to the contrary, O’Mara narrates her tale of Silicon Valley’s rise as, ultimately, a success story. At the end of the book, we see it as the envy of other states around the country and other countries around the world, an “exuberantly capitalist, slightly anarchic tech ecosystem that had evolved over several generations.” Throughout the book, she highlights the many issues that have sparked increasing public consternation with Big Tech of late, from its lack of diversity to its stupendous concentration of wealth, but these are framed in the end as unfortunate side effects of the headlong rush to create a new and brilliant future. She hardly mentions the revelations by the National Security Agency whistle-blower Edward Snowden of the US government’s chilling capacity to siphon users’ most intimate information from Silicon Valley’s platforms and the voraciousness with which it has done so. Nor does she grapple with Uber, which built its multibillion-dollar leviathan on the backs of meagerly paid drivers. The fact that in order to carry out almost anything online we must subject ourselves to a hypercommodified hellscape of targeted advertising and algorithmic sorting does not appear to be a huge cause for concern. But these and many other aspects of our digital landscape have made me wonder if a technical complex born out of Cold War militarism and mainstreamed in a free-market frenzy might not be fundamentally always at odds with human flourishing. O’Mara suggests at the end of her book that Silicon Valley’s flaws might be redeemed by a new, more enlightened, and more diverse generation of techies. But haven’t we heard this story before?\n\nIf there is a larger lesson to learn from The Code, it is that technology cannot be separated from the social and political contexts in which it is created. The major currents in society shape and guide the creation of a system that appears to spring from the minds of its inventors alone. Militarism and unbridled capitalism remain among the most powerful forces in the United States, and to my mind, there is no reason to believe that a new generation of techies might resist them any more effectively than the previous ones. The question of fixing Silicon Valley is inseparable from the question of fixing the system of postwar American capitalism, of which it is perhaps the purest expression. Some believe that the problems we see are bugs that might be fixed with a patch. Others think the code is so bad at its core that a radical rewrite is the only answer. Although The Code was written for people in the first group, it offers an important lesson for those of us in the second: Silicon Valley is as much a symptom as it is a cause of our current crisis. Resisting its bad influence on society will ultimately prove meaningless if we cannot also formulate a vision of a better world—one with a more humane relationship to technology—to counteract it. And, alas, there is no app for

Blog Post 3: Become a person who Actually Does Things — Neel Nanda","link":"https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/become-a-person-who-actually-does-things","content":"Mini Blog Post 3: Become a person who Actually Does Things\n\nThere are two kinds of people in the world: People who actually do things, and people who don’t.\n\nNow I’ve got the unnecessarily provocative opening line out of the way, what do I actually mean by this? To achieve a goal, this breaks down into two parts: figure out what needs to be done, and actually do it.\n\nAs stated, this sounds completely trivial. But I think there’s a really important and non-obvious point in here. Some part of me is convinced that the main bottleneck for achieving my goals is being smart, coming up with the best plan, getting all of the necessarily information. And this is true! It doesn’t matter how good you are at doing things, if what you’re doing is crap. But it also doesn’t matter how good my plan is if I never act upon it.\n\nAnd it’s really easy to miss this point. It’s easy to always think “I can do this tomorrow” or “this is not a priority” or “this would never work”. And it’s hard, because sometimes those thoughts are correct. But I find that, unless I put in active effort, I’m the kind of person who’ll always have those thoughts. I’ll never actually act upon my goals, change things about my life.\n\nOne of the main symptoms of this is that I’m always aware of problems in my life, and will often be aware of them for a very long time. I’ll notice that I don’t exercise enough, that I’m not enjoying the courses I’m studying, that I really dislike being single, that I don’t have enough time to do what I find most fulfilling. But there won’t be a connection in my mind from “this is a problem” to “what am I going to do about it”. It’s not that I think through the problem, and conclude that I can’t do anything, it’s that it never feels like there’s a question to be asked in the first place! And I think this is a problem that extends far beyond me - I notice some amount of this in most of my friends, and I think it’s incredibly widespread. There seems to be a mental block between “things are not as I want them to be” and “I can actually do something about this”.\n\nI think this really sucks, and can be one of the biggest meta-problems holding you back. But the reason I’m writing this post is not to complain about how much it sucks, it’s because I think this is a solvable problem. Being the kind of person who does things, an agent , is a skill, and I think it is a trainable skill. And this is hard, and won’t work perfectly, but there’s a lot of room for progress. And this is one of the most valuable skills I’ve ever tried developing.\n\nThe main symptom is that, in the moment, acting upon your desires never feels urgent. It never feels important, and can be put off. Or it never feels possible, the problem just feels like a fact of life. And so a solution must center on solving the problem in the moment. And the solution that worked for me, is to make it part of your identity to be an agent. Make it a point of principle to do things, not because the thing is necessarily the perfect action, but because I choose the life where I do things, over the life where I always wait for the perfect opportunity.\n\nNotice the small problems, and fix them. Notice when everyone isn’t enjoying what they’re doing, and be the first person to voice this. Notice when the jug of water is empty, and be the one to fill it. Notice when you say “oh, I can do this tomorrow” and do it today. Notice when you think “I should get round to this some time” or “I’ve always wanted to learn juggling” and actually do it. Notice when something is inefficient, notice the thing nobody is doing, and be the person who does it!\n\nThe point of this, is that I avoid the paralysing perfectionism and uncertainty by changing the question I am answering. It doesn’t matter if I’m not doing the right thing, because what I’m doing isn’t that important. I can close off the paralysing thoughts, not by answering them on their own terms, but by realising that the choices I make today affect the kind of person I’ll be for the rest of my life. And that that’s far more important than whatever trivial bullshit is going in my life today. And thus, I train the habit of actually doing things. Figuring out the right thing to do is also a vital skill, but can come second. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\nAnd it doesn’t even matter if I do make the wrong or imperfect choice in all of the day-to-day mundanity. What matters is that, when that one golden opportunity comes along, I am the kind of person who will take it. A thousand tiny losses are nothing against the big win that really counts.\n\nIf there’s one thing you take from this post, let it be this: notice the next time you agonise over a choice, or pass up an opportunity. And ask yourself not “what is the right decision” but rather “which decision will get me closer to the kind of person I want to be”.","tokenFrequency":{"mental":1,"correct":1,"fill":1,"won't":2,"get":3,"mean":1,"extend":1,"they'r":1,"moment":2,"choos":1,"often":1,"can't":1,"solut":2,"crap":1,"close":1,"goal":3,"uncertainti":1,"exercis":1,"true":1,"i'v":2,"break":1,"take":2,"juggling”":1,"don't":4,"also":2,"be”":2,"it”":1,"rather":1,"noth":1,"mini":1,"activ":1,"blog":1,"find":2,"seem":1,"“thing":1,"everyon":1,"let":2,"unless":1,"need":1,"paralys":2,"alway":5,"progress":1,"this”":1,"opportun":3,"state":1,"pass":1,"singl":1,"lot":1,"trainabl":1,"“oh":1,"go":2,"thought":3,"say":1,"peopl":3,"golden":1,"habit":1,"awar":2,"priority”":1,"chang":2,"nobodi":1,"whatev":1,"best":1,"thousand":1,"right":3,"bullshit":1,"want":3,"sound":1,"unnecessarili":1,"“i":3,"block":1,"win":1,"i'll":3,"would":1,"conclud":1,"tini":1,"line":1,"plan":2,"decision”":1,"perfection":1,"round":1,"put":2,"main":3,"studi":1,"center":1,"train":1,"count":1,"friend":1,"think":9,"place":1,"tri":1,"actual":8,"answer":2,"bottleneck":1,"cours":1,"it":7,"thing":13,"much":1,"work”":1,"amount":1,"vital":1,"long":1,"“what":2,"complain":1,"thus":1,"easi":2,"symptom":2,"connect":1,"choic":3,"provoc":1,"i'm":7,"suck":2,"possibl":1,"action":1,"rest":1,"kind":6,"complet":1,"notic":10,"never":7,"wrong":1,"back":1,"come":3,"part":3,"feel":5,"enemi":1,"second":1,"small":1,"ident":1,"inform":1,"agent":2,"realis":1,"smart":1,"life":7,"time":3,"time”":1,"trivial":2,"who'll":1,"convinc":1,"realli":5,"open":1,"imperfect":1,"mundan":1,"“which":1,"enough":2,"next":1,"metaproblem":1,"done":1,"skill":4,"isn't":2,"there":4,"mind":1,"widespread":1,"beyond":1,"necessarili":2,"one":6,"you'r":1,"enjoy":2,"post":3,"affect":1,"empti":1,"problem":7,"ever":1,"miss":1,"voic":1,"problem”":1,"work":2,"nonobvi":1,"fact":1,"got":1,"fix":1,"learn":1,"principl":1,"today":3,"achiev":2,"sometim":1,"desir":1,"matter":5,"like":2,"fulfil":1,"solv":1,"solvabl":1,"“i'v":1,"becom":1,"urgent":1,"that":1,"incred":1,"room":1,"even":1,"biggest":1,"person":8,"wait":1,"figur":2,"upon":3,"":13,"way":1,"someth":2,"ineffici":1,"make":4,"decis":1,"reason":1,"effort":1,"world":1,"ask":2,"good":3,"term":1,"daytoday":1,"anyth":1,"point":4,"hard":2,"jug":1,"avoid":1,"“this":3,"dislik":1,"write":1,"import":4,"loss":1,"hold":1,"develop":1,"agonis":1,"far":2,"must":1,"tomorrow”":2,"doesn't":4,"closer":1,"first":2,"along":1,"question":2,"big":1,"act":3,"valuabl":1,"water":1,"two":2,"perfect":4}},"19295":{"id":"19295","title":"Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Engineers: Introduction | Dark Forest Blog","link":"https://blog.zkga.me/intro-to-zksnarks","content":"In this post, we’re going to talk about zkSNARKs, which are a particular brand of Zero Knowledge Proof that’s becoming increasingly important in the blockchain space.\n\nWe’ll cover how they’re used and what they’re useful for, and we’ll take a look at a basic zkSNARK in a SNARK-building language called Circom.\n\nWe assume that you’re encountered prime fields before, and remember their basic properties. If you can calculate \\(4 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 6\\) in \\(\\mathbb{F}_7\\), you’re good to go.\n\nA zero knowledge protocol is a protocol that allows you to prove that you know some specific mathematical fact, without revealing any information about the fact itself. The proof generated in a zero knowledge protocol is called a zero knowledge proof.\n\nSome examples of “mathematical facts” that we can create zero knowledge proofs for include things like:\n\nThe idea of a zero knowledge protocol might seem paradoxical at first glance: how can I prove I know something without showing you the thing that I know? However, it turns out that we actually use zero knowledge protocols all the time! For example, familiar tools like digital signatures are actually zero knowledge proofs. By signing a message, I prove that I know the private key that corresponds to a widely-known public key, but I don’t give away any information about the private key itself. In fact, public-key encryption only works because it is a zero knowledge protocol; if signatures revealed information about your private key, then malicious actors would be able to impersonate you by analyzing your signatures and recovering your private key.\n\nSlightly more formally, suppose that you’ve computed \\(f(\\cdot) = y\\) for some publicly known function \\(f\\) and some secret input \\(\\cdot\\). A zero-knowledge protocol for the function \\(f\\) would allow you to prove to others that you know a secret input to \\(f\\) that results in \\(y\\), without revealing this secret input \\(\\cdot\\).\n\nFor more on ZKPs, check out this post .\n\nLike we mentioned above, ZKPs are protocols that allow you to prove knowledge of a specific mathematical fact: discrete log, knowledge of private key, knowledge of three-coloring, etc. However, it’s important to note that early ZKPs only allowed you to prove one kind of mathematical fact at the time. That is, cryptographers developed one protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of discrete log, another protocol which you could use to prove knowledge of three-coloring, and another protocol for digital signatures. But what if we want to generate zero knowledge proofs for arbitrary mathematical functions? For example - what if I want a zero knowledge protocol that would allow me to prove that I know the pre-image of a SHA256 hash output? It would be intractable if, for every use case, I had to go to a cryptographer and ask them to custom-write me a new protocol.\n\nzkSNARKs solve this problem. A zkSNARK is a gadget that can be used to generate a ZKP for any mathematical function. Basically, you feed the “code” of a function \\(f\\) into a zkSNARK, and the SNARK creates a protocol that allows you to generate zero-knowledge proofs for \\(f\\).\n\nAs an example, say we have a fake “hash” function \\(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\\) that we’d like to generate zero knowledge proofs for. First, we can use a zkSNARK to generate a ZKP for \\(h\\). Then, we can use this generated ZKP to prove claims like “I know a value \\(\\cdot\\) such that \\(h(\\cdot) = 67\\)” - without revealing \\(\\cdot\\). zkSNARKs also guarantee that this process is “succinct” and “non-interactive”: we can create this proof in linear time, and others can verify it in constant time, without needing to ask additional questions of us (the prover). Together, these properties form a zkSNARK: a Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge.\n\nThese properties makes SNARKs useful for blockchain applications, where users can create proofs locally, and then upload short proofs for constant-time verification inside a smart contract, where computation is expensive.\n\nA central mechanic in Dark Forest is that the cryptographic “fog of war.” The fog of war ensures that you don’t automatically know where all players, planets, and other points of interests are in the universe; you have to spend computational resources to discover them. This mechanic is secured by zkSNARKs.\n\nIn a universe with a fog of war, the locations of all players are private and hidden from each other. This means that players don’t upload the coordinates of their planets to the Ethereum blockchain, which can be publicly inspected. Instead, each player uploads the hash of their location to the blockchain. This ensures that players stay “committed” to a specific location, but also that the location can’t be determined from inspection of the Ethereum data layer.\n\nWithout zkSNARKs, there’s an obvious attack vector - if a player uploads a random string of bytes that doesn’t correspond to a real and valid location, and the integrity of the game is broken. To prevent this, Dark Forest requires players to submit zkSNARKs with every move to ensure that players are indeed submitting hashes corresponding to valid coordinates that they have knowledge of.\n\nWhen players make moves, they’re also required to submit ZK proofs that their moves are “valid” - you can’t move too far or too fast. Without zkSNARKs, a malicious player could make illegal “teleport” moves by claiming that the hash they are moving from is next to the hash they’re moving to, even if the two locations are actually on opposite sides of the universe. Once again, requiring ZK proofs keeps players honest. To use a chess analogy, the required ZK proofs basically tell the contract, “I’m moving my knight; I’m not going to tell you where I moved my knight from, or where I moved it to, but this proof proves that it did in fact move in a legal L-shape.”\n\nWe’ll dive deeper into the Dark Forest construction and SNARKs in a future blog post!\n\nLike we mentioned above, SNARKs are gadgets which take in a function and output a ZKP for said function. So how do we “feed” a function to a SNARK?\n\nSNARKs functions are written as circuits in the Circom language. Here’s an example circuit for our “fake” hash function, \\(h(x) = x^3 - x + 7\\).\n\nOur zkSNARK takes in this circuit, chews it up, and spits out a proving key and a verifying key. The proving key allows a prover who is computing BadHash(x) = out to generate a proof that they do indeed know the pre-image of out . The verifying key allows anyone to inspect that proof, along with out , and conclude that the prover did honestly carry out the computation with a known secret input.\n\nConcretely, suppose that the prover computes BadHash(4) = 67 . The prover publishes their proof, along with out = 67 , to the verifier; however, they do not publish the secret input x = 4 . The verifier of this proof knows the source code of the BadHash circuit, and also receives out = 67 and a proof from the prover. The verifier can then inspect the proof to verify that the prover did indeed compute some valid x, x_squared, and x_cubed to arrive at out . However, the verifier won’t know the specific values that the prover used ( x = 4 , x_squared = 16 , x_cubed = 64 ) - just that these values were computed correctly.\n\nThere are two things which make SNARK circuits different from normal “functions” that we’re used to.\n\nFirst, you’ll notice that BadHash only uses three operations: multiplication, addition, and subtraction. At the base level, SNARK constraints are limited to only these operations. There are ways to do operations like division and modulo, but they all ultimately involve breaking operations down into sums and products. The fact that we’re limited to these operations is part of what makes SNARK programming thorny.\n\nThe second challenge is that each signal in a SNARK is an element of a prime field, and all operations happen inside that prime field. The most obvious implication of this is that there is no native notion of decimals, fractions, negative numbers, or numbers bigger than 77 digits. If you want one of these, you have to make them out of positive integers smaller than p . Another implication is that our operators “wrap around”: the result of 3 - 5 is p - 2 , which is a 77 digit number. The prime is large enough (254) that most of the time this doesn’t matter, but occasionally it can cause subtle correctness bugs.\n\nTo actually make proofs, we use a library called SnarkJS , built by Jordi Baylina and Iden3. SnarkJS uses your circuit to generate proving and verification code in JavaScript and Solidity, as well as protocol paramters and proving and verification keys. This is out of the scope of this post, but you can find a tutorial on it here .\n\nIn the next posts, we’ll talk about the execution model of SNARKs, including the difference between calculation and constraint, and how to do operations like division and modulo.","tokenFrequency":{"badhash4":1,"addit":2,"“noninteractive”":1,"increas":1,"tutori":1,"“succinct”":1,"you'll":1,"might":1,"here":1,"time":5,"broken":1,"prover":8,"implic":2,"want":3,"publish":2,"other":2,"instead":1,"said":1,"sha256":1,"kind":1,"challeng":1,"can't":2,"threecolor":2,"side":1,"inform":3,"there":1,"becom":1,"bug":1,"insid":2,"data":1,"form":1,"take":3,"calcul":2,"away":1,"would":4,"say":1,"hcdot":1,"you'v":1,"output":2,"smart":1,"ethereum":2,"well":1,"real":1,"paramt":1,"code":2,"string":1,"legal":1,"“mathemat":1,"fog":2,"hidden":1,"go":4,"war":2,"three":1,"univers":3,"concret":1,"need":1,"exampl":5,"“wrap":1,"show":1,"badhash":2,"work":1,"iden3":1,"zero":13,"we'd":1,"formal":1,"point":1,"feed":1,"“hash”":1,"noninteract":1,"fact":7,"happen":1,"requir":4,"languag":2,"togeth":1,"check":1,"locat":6,"we'r":3,"bigger":1,"zk":3,"without":7,"obvious":2,"paradox":1,"break":1,"prevent":1,"chess":1,"field":3,"67”":1,"messag":1,"stay":1,"contract":2,"occasion":1,"allow":8,"determin":1,"expens":1,"far":1,"keep":1,"good":1,"decim":1,"byte":1,"war”":1,"hash":6,"seem":1,"particular":1,"doesn't":2,"protocol":15,"circuit":6,"254":1,"basic":4,"first":3,"recov":1,"malici":2,"constant":1,"program":1,"everi":2,"input":5,"negat":1,"notic":1,"like":8,"intract":1,"67":3,"assum":1,"badhashx":1,"snarkj":2,"suppos":2,"solv":1,"77":2,"oper":8,"sourc":1,"inde":3,"written":1,"key":11,"built":1,"linear":1,"talk":2,"actor":1,"scope":1,"local":1,"discov":1,"privat":6,"construct":1,"zeroknowledg":2,"thorni":1,"“code”":1,"valu":3,"creat":4,"ultim":1,"“committed”":1,"find":1,"constraint":2,"involv":1,"guarante":1,"publickey":1,"problem":1,"comput":8,"sign":1,"normal":1,"notion":1,"analyz":1,"includ":2,"applic":1,"signatur":4,"know":11,"call":3,"coordin":2,"ensur":3,"ask":2,"dark":3,"around”":1,"":49,"proof":22,"64":1,"familiar":1,"fcdot":1,"function":11,"part":1,"idea":1,"they'r":4,"player":11,"secret":5,"howev":4,"secur":1,"cdot":5,"lshape”":1,"receiv":1,"we'll":4,"tool":1,"glanc":1,"sum":1,"process":1,"new":1,"gadget":2,"actual":4,"short":1,"look":1,"knowledg":20,"fake":1,"import":2,"limit":2,"anoth":3,"interest":1,"forest":3,"multipl":1,"could":3,"circom":2,"properti":3,"librari":1,"even":1,"widelyknown":1,"valid":3,"level":1,"customwrit":1,"us":1,"model":1,"smaller":1,"along":2,"question":1,"signal":1,"product":1,"resourc":1,"correct":2,"known":2,"“fake”":1,"don't":3,"facts”":1,"turn":1,"user":1,"imperson":1,"note":1,"attack":1,"knight":2,"cover":1,"posit":1,"mean":1,"hx":2,"equiv":1,"succinct":1,"subtract":1,"javascript":1,"give":1,"jordi":1,"verif":3,"reveal":4,"xsquar":2,"public":3,"element":1,"upload":4,"discret":2,"next":2,"rememb":1,"encount":1,"preimag":2,"matter":1,"inspect":4,"that":1,"futur":1,"spit":1,"abl":1,"etc":1,"analog":1,"“i":1,"result":2,"case":1,"you'r":2,"anyon":1,"zkps":3,"xcube":2,"way":1,"opposit":1,"generat":9,"“feed”":1,"base":1,"make":7,"baylina":1,"modulo":2,"digit":4,"slight":1,"mathbbf7":1,"snark":11,"16":1,"x^3":2,"it":1,"nativ":1,"zksnark":13,"differ":2,"“functions”":1,"prime":4,"larg":1,"mechan":2,"encrypt":1,"mathemat":5,"spend":1,"brand":1,"post":5,"automat":1,"cryptograph":3,"“teleport”":1,"planet":2,"random":1,"use":16,"execut":1,"log":2,"arriv":1,"caus":1,"“valid”":1,"honest":2,"zkp":4,"deeper":1,"blockchain":4,"enough":1,"arbitrari":1,"argument":1,"second":1,"specif":4,"game":1,"develop":1,"solid":1,"fraction":1,"submit":3,"chew":1,"dive":1,"prove":15,"conclud":1,"divis":2,"snarkbuild":1,"tell":2,"illeg":1,"two":2,"space":1,"integ":1,"won't":1,"claim":2,"layer":1,"central":1,"“i'm":1,"move":11,"earli":1,"“fog":1,"blog":1,"i'm":1,"number":3,"constanttim":1,"carri":1,"thing":3,"fast":1,"integr":1,"subtl":1,"mention":2,"also":4,"one":3,"someth":1,"verifi":8,"vector":1,"correspond":3}},"3182":{"id":"3182","title":"World's Hardest Problems","link":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vb8WWbsVyEJzl66_qqtZfFr2uLL07Y7SJH5XKldjDPY/edit","content":"JavaScript isn't enabled in your browser, so this file can't be opened.

But there’s one thing that we tend to overlook, and that is AI like any other technology is a double-edged sword that could have negative implications on our human-and-digital rights and cause harm if it falls into the wrong hands. The abuse of AI technologies, the risks associated with it needs to be addressed urgently, and we need to draw the line somewhere.\n\n“AI is a tool. The choice about how it gets deployed is ours. “ — Oren Etzioni\n\nA DeepFake nudie app called DeepNude went viral in the past few weeks and it’s the latest example of AI-generated deepfakes being used to create compromising images of unsuspecting women. And just after two days of its launch, the anonymous creator claimed that it has been hacked and decided to pull the plug on his invention saying “ The World is not yet ready. “ he also released a statement on Twitter saying that they will not be granting anyone its use and will not be releasing any other versions.\n\nLater on GitHub proceeded to remove the software source code from its platform — But unfortunately, the software has been reverse-engineered and could surface anywhere on the web. A recent report from HuffPost highlighted how being targeted by deepfake pornography and nudes can upend someone’s life. Now anyone could find themselves a victim of revenge porn, without ever having taken a nude photo. these images can be used to shame, harass, intimidate, and silence women. There are forums where men can pay experts to create deepfakes of co-workers, friends, or family members, but tools like DeepNude make it easy to create such images in private and at the touch of a button. A product like this is extremely dangerous and it threatens the internet’s openness as a safe space for everyone, especially women.\n\nEarlier this year, OpenAI announced they would not release the full version of an AI technology that can automatically write realistic texts, based partly on the content of 8 million web pages. “Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model.” they wrote , calling it an experiment in “responsible disclosure”. We need to be seeing more of this acknowledgment of the risks and dangers of malicious AI applications and to think responsibly about the impacts they could have on our lives and human-experience before releasing them.\n\nDigital rights specialists, technologists, journalists and researchers have taken gradual steps over the past years towards urging companies, governments, military, and law enforcement agencies to acknowledge the ethical quandaries, inaccuracies and risks involved. And now more than ever, we need to establish a universal standard that emphasizes and tackles the ethical challenges of AI. Most importantly we need to start being skeptical about technology and deepen our understanding of AI for a healthier ecosystem and a bright narrative of a future that nurtures and sustains both humanity and technology.\n\nLove podcasts or audiobooks?

Col. Stanislav Petrov, that it could say with “high reliability” that an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had been launched and was headed toward the Soviet Union. First, it was just one missile, but then another, and another, until the system reported that a total of five Minuteman ICBMs had been launched.\n\n“Petrov had to make a decision: Would he report an incoming American strike?” my colleague Max Fisher explained . “If he did, Soviet nuclear doctrine called for a full nuclear retaliation; there would be no time to double-check the warning system, much less seek negotiations with the US.”\n\nReporting it would have made a certain degree of sense. The Reagan administration had a far more hardline stance against the Soviets than the Carter, Ford, or Nixon administrations before it. Months earlier President Reagan had announced the Strategic Defense Initiative (mockingly dubbed “Star Wars,” a plan to shoot down ballistic missiles before they reached the US), and his administration was in the process of deploying Pershing II nuclear-armed missiles to West Germany and Great Britain , which were capable of striking the Soviet Union. There were reasons for Petrov to think Reagan’s brinkmanship had escalated to an actual nuclear exchange.\n\nBut Petrov did not report the incoming strike. He and others on his staff concluded that what they were seeing was a false alarm. And it was; the system mistook the sun’s reflection off clouds for a missile . Petrov prevented a nuclear war between the Soviets, who had 35,804 nuclear warheads in 1983 , and the US, which had 23,305.\n\nA 1979 report by Congress’s Office of Technology Assessment estimated that a full-scale Soviet assault on the US would kill 35 to 77 percent of the US population — or between 82 million and 180 million people in 1983. The inevitable US counterstrike would kill 20 to 40 percent of the Soviet population, or between 54 million and 108 million people. The combined death toll there (between 136 million and 288 million) swamps the death toll of any war, genocide, or other violent catastrophe in human history. Proportional to world population, it would be rivaled only by the An Lushan rebellion in eighth-century China and the Mongol conquests of the 13th century .\n\nAnd it’s likely hundreds of millions more would have died once the conflict disrupted global temperatures and severely hampered agriculture. International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War put the potential death toll from starvation at about 2 billion .\n\nPreventing the deaths of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people was a costly decision for Petrov. If he had been wrong, and he somehow survived the American nuclear strike, he likely would’ve been executed for treason. Even though he was right, he was, according to the Washington Post’s David Hoffman , “relentlessly interrogated afterward [and] never rewarded for his decision.”\n\nPetrov was not the only Russian official who’s saved the world. On October 27, 1962, Vasili Arkhipov, a Soviet navy officer, was in a nuclear submarine near Cuba when US naval forces started dropping depth charges (a kind of explosive targeting submarines) on him. Two senior officers on the submarine thought that a nuclear war could’ve already begun and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo at a US vessel. But all three senior officers had to agree for the missile to fire, and Arkhipov dissented, preventing a nuclear exchange and potentially preventing the end of the world.\n\nEven more recently, on January 25, 1995, Russian early warning radars suggested that an American first strike was incoming . President Boris Yeltsin was alerted and given a suitcase with instructions for launching a nuclear strike at the US. Russian nuclear forces were given an alert to increase combat readiness. Yeltsin eventually declined to launch a counterstrike — which is good, because this was another false alarm. It turns out that Russian early warning systems had picked up a Norwegian-US joint research rocket, launched by scientists studying the northern lights.\n\nBut September 26, Stanislav Petrov Day, is as good a time as any to celebrate the ordinary officers who took a stand when it counted to prevent hundreds of millions of deaths. And it’s as good a time as any to remember that as long as the US and Russia retain massive nuclear arsenals, these kinds of close calls will remain possible — and in the future, a false alarm could result in an accidental first strike.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

A PT cruiser slammed into the side of my car, crossing 3 lanes of the highway at 70 mph. Unlucky timing in that there was nothing I could do to react or prevent the car from hitting me… but also very lucky. Lucky that I was wearing my glasses when the windshield broke and the glass shattered on top of me. Lucky my car didn’t crush me when it flipped or spun, eventually landing on the highway barrier. Lucky to have lived, walking away from the accident with just minor bruising and a concussion. The paramedics and witnesses on the scene were the first to tell me it was a miracle I survived.\n\nAnyone who has a near-death experience typically walks away a “new person” – it’s frankly hard not to. That morning I was driving into NYC to look at apartments and start my “new life” as a 20-something. Then I was upside down wondering if I’d live or even be able to get out of my car, let alone start a new life.\n\nA lot has changed in a year. I sleep less. I dream bigger. I love fiercely. I’m more impatient than I’ve ever been. I hate being asked “where do you see yourself in 5-10 years.” I used to be a self-declared type-A planner \u0026 have well-thought out answers to just about everything… now I just think about the present, the next few months, and what I can control now. It keeps me sane and grounded.\n\nThe biggest thing I’ve learned is that most people take time for granted. And this is perpetuated in conversations, culture, and even the workplace – especially for young people. “What’s the rush?”... “You’re only 24, ​​your time will come”... “Be patient”... “Take your time”... A year ago I nodded my head and agreed.\n\nToday, I don’t. I make no assumptions that I’ll have the privilege of being here in 6 months, a year, or 20 years. There’s a sense of urgency in everything I do now that’s hard to fully comprehend – to move up in life, to make an impact, to fall in love, to be taken seriously, to be kind. I have so many ideas and things I want to do and accomplish, but not enough time. I don’t think there will ever be enough time.\n\nThe reality is that there are so many unknowns in life and things you can’t control, but you can control the present – how you treat others, how you spend your time, the energy you put out into the world. Life is too short to be miserable or to wait for your future to happen.\n\nMy accident sent me on a bit of a spiral, initially in a bad way – I spent a week recovering from all the bruises, trauma, and my concussion just thinking and reflecting on everything in my life – the good, and the bad. I didn’t even cry the day of the accident – it took almost a full year for me to break down crying about it, with a TikTok video/trend sending me into a full on breakdown when I was visiting Miami in January. The accident made me question a lot of things in my life, and I quickly made changes (for better, or for worse).\n\nAs a result, I experienced loss in a different way this past year – at times it was loss in confidence in myself, loss in routine and healthy habits, loss in trust in the people I looked up to, and even loss in direction at times because of external expectations and pressures. But all of this made me grow up… a lot. I’m a very different person today than I was a year ago in that car. I’m confident in myself, my purpose, and following my own path – even if it’s untraditional or makes people uncomfortable. More than ever, I’m steadfast in fighting for what I believe is right.\n\nNext week, I turn 25… a quarter of a century old. I still have a lot to learn, experience, and do in my life. And I’ll be wasting no time.","tokenFrequency":{"uncomfort":1,"car":6,"treat":1,"–":10,"wit":1,"neardeath":1,"typic":1,"it":2,"full":2,"everything…":1,"enough":2,"accid":5,"extern":1,"glass":2,"wait":1,"“new":2,"hard":2,"march":1,"25…":1,"24":1,"agre":1,"move":1,"young…":1,"spiral":1,"me…":1,"convers":1,"privileg":1,"direct":1,"apart":1,"cruiser":1,"let":1,"assumpt":1,"time":10,"come”":1,"bad":2,"impact":1,"cross":1,"routin":1,"that":1,"nod":1,"love":2,"perpetu":1,"miser":1,"quick":1,"look":2,"could":1,"workplac":1,"experi":2,"minor":1,"morn":1,"happen":1,"“what":1,"today":3,"unlucki":1,"fierc":1,"“be":1,"confid":2,"untradit":1,"recov":1,"tiktok":1,"sens":1,"world":1,"past":1,"dream":1,"up…":1,"shatter":1,"frank":1,"scene":1,"purpos":1,"miracl":1,"send":1,"drive":1,"accomplish":1,"top":1,"27th":1,"hit":1,"lucki":4,"see":1,"70":1,"differ":2,"lot":4,"expect":1,"way":2,"miami":1,"sleep":1,"futur":1,"windshield":1,"time”":1,"spent":1,"old":1,"didn't":2,"":10,"want":1,"walk":2,"follow":1,"think":3,"20":1,"upsid":1,"bit":1,"live":2,"taken":1,"initi":1,"eventu":1,"week":2,"right":1,"centuri":1,"sent":1,"wellthought":1,"learn":2,"i'm":4,"bigger":1,"510":1,"place":1,"unknown":1,"made":3,"paramed":1,"realiti":1,"take":1,"ago":3,"ground":1,"experienc":1,"biggest":1,"believ":1,"serious":1,"20someth":1,"break":1,"urgenc":1,"mean":1,"there":1,"ever":3,"also":1,"anyon":1,"head":1,"flip":1,"turn":1,"videotrend":1,"reflect":1,"wors":1,"especi":1,"other":1,"mani":2,"use":1,"trauma":1,"don't":2,"barrier":1,"land":1,"januari":1,"sane":1,"get":1,"put":1,"noth":1,"present":2,"path":1,"person”":1,"idea":1,"planner":1,"life”":1,"quarter":1,"wrong":2,"make":3,"month":2,"“you'r":1,"slam":1,"comprehend":1,"better":1,"typea":1,"steadfast":1,"patient”":1,"alon":1,"near":1,"result":1,"selfdeclar":1,"visit":1,"answer":1,"habit":1,"kind":1,"lane":1,"day":1,"start":2,"pressur":1,"breakdown":1,"short":1,"spun":1,"broke":1,"tell":1,"spend":1,"ask":1,"freak":1,"highway":2,"year":8,"cri":2,"fall":1,"pt":1,"control":3,"chang":2,"still":1,"took":1,"trust":1,"years”":1,"“where":1,"crush":1,"good":1,"can't":1,"i'd":1,"​​your":1,"react":1,"young":1,"life":8,"cultur":1,"abl":1,"next":2,"concuss":2,"impati":1,"grant":1,"side":1,"question":1,"rush”":1,"less":1,"surviv":1,"mph":1,"energi":1,"away":2,"wonder":1,"i'v":2,"i'll":2,"prevent":1,"thing":4,"bruis":2,"grow":1,"peopl":4,"nyc":1,"loss":5,"“take":1,"fight":1,"end":1,"fulli":1,"everyth":2,"first":1,"new":1,"wast":1,"person":1,"hate":1,"almost":1,"healthi":1,"keep":1,"wear":1,"even":5}},"21752":{"id":"21752","title":"Overlooked Problems - Adaobi’s Newsletter","link":"https://adaobi.substack.com/p/overlooked-problems?s=w","content":"Overlooked Problems\n\nThese are a list of problems I think don’t get enough attention but are worth solving. Therefore you won’t find major problems like climate change on here because these are problems generally accepted as highly important and are being worked on a lot (although more can be done).\n\nTo prove and predict a person's ability is a very powerful thing. It controls who works where, what influence they have over what, what resources they get access to etc. Relying on brand names and biased qualitative data to make important decisions such as these seems woefully mismatched. I’ve written more about this topic here .\n\nBeyond plays and musicals making life that much more enjoyable, they also act as fuel for better action. When you leave a good show you feel a deeper connection with emotions words can’t yet describe. This deeper sense of connection acts as fuel for action in the real world. A good example of this is Hamilton. After seeing it you can’t help but feel a sense of urgency. This caused me to 1) dream bigger and 2) pursue these dreams as quickly as possible. In times of crisis it’s still the show I run back to.\n\nUnfortunately, since Hamilton It’s been a while since I have seen a really good play or musical. To be clear I have not seen a ridiculous amount of shows but from speaking with friends who have, we mostly share the same feeling.\n\nMy friend Charles is working on this, and I think he has some really great ideas. If you’d like to support him in solving this problem please reach out to him!\n\nWhat comes after the professional critic\n\nRelating to my points about good plays and musicals, a lot of the shows I have watched have been at the recommendation of highly praised reviews from professional critics. Reflecting back on my experience the reviews were truly terrible from an informational point of view. They were just filled with a lot of fancy words, sentences that didn’t mean anything and generally came across as fake deep.\n\nI don’t really understand the professional critic’s incentive structure, but I do have to wonder if this plays a role in just how ridiculous they can be. I suppose the real question is why do we give them so much power and what comes next?\n\nHaving kidney failure is horrible. The current most effective solution is a living donor transplant, however finding a living donor is rare and going the deceased donor route comes with a long wait time. In either case, both solutions come with an expiration date of 10-20 years until you need another.\n\nThe most ideal solution would be restoring my organ back to full health, however the science is not quite there yet. Until then growing organs made of one's own cells should be the priority. Yes, surgery sucks, but not having the expiration date of your organ looming over you makes it worth it. That and removing the need for immunosuppressive medication and all the wonderful things that come with it.\n\nA lot of people have accumulated tokens that will no longer appreciate in value, however that does not mean they are not valuable. In most cases a person usually has 1) a spendable* amount of money spread across a high number of “shit coins” that can’t be spent all through one transaction or 2) Have a shitcoin that has small spendable value, but the gas fees are too high to justify the spend.\n\nIf crypto is going to become a big thing then I would like to be able to at least spend it, especially since most of my everyday transactions aren’t more than £20.\n\nPutting Theranos aside, if someone were able to figure this out (with ideally a drop of blood), that would help a lot with catching diseases early. Speaking for myself I know for sure this would have.\n\nNasty things. Having a needle in your arm permanently as a means of giving medication \u0026 taking blood is not great. Personally, I can’t think of a way to solve this problem, but the fact remains that it is extremely unpleasant and it would be nice to see some improvement in this area.\n\nWhy are MRI and CT scans so big? Why can hospitals only afford to have so few? Given how essential they are for diagnosing a whole bunch of medical issues, surely we should be working towards making them as cheap and accessible as possible? In an ideal world wouldn’t it be nice, maybe even life saving, if you could screen yourself much more often at the comfort of your own home?\n\nGiven the well documented relationship between unhealthy food and disease, it seems criminal that healthier options are not affordable and available in impoverished areas, especially given that they are more likely to be unable to afford treatment for these diseases.\n\nI have never worked in government so I will never truly understand how tough the job is or all the constraints they have to work with. That being said, as with anything, there is always room for improvement.\n\nGiven how much the government spends each year you would expect a massive change in the quality of life over the last 10 years, but that doesn’t seem to be the case (for me anyways).\n\nPutting aside the poor value for money, I just do not trust the people in government to make decisions on my behalf. They have not given me any reason to, and doubt they ever will. The only thing that gives me hope is that “government” was not always like this. Like most things in nature it evolves - so what comes next?\n\nCurrent conventional wisdom dictates that the average person should focus on one thing, with only a few being able to handle the many. I actually think the opposite. I think most people are really good generalists, and only a few people are (and should be) specialists. I think if more people were encouraged to pursue their multiple interests the world would be more interesting.\n\nAlthough the traumas of racism are heavily discussed, there is one area I feel isn’t talked about enough, and that is the theft of genius that comes with it.\n\nAs a Black woman you can expect to experience these 3 things in life:\n\n1) Societal pressure to use your resources to enable the betterment of your people\n\n2) Internal pressure to use your resources to enable the betterment of your people\n\n3) Have all your interests, hopes, dreams pigeonholed by society into being Black and being a woman.\n\nThese three things rob us of the ability to build, dream and just do for the sake of it. A good, but unfortunate, example of lost genius is Miss Nina Simone.\n\nAlthough the path she ended up on was successful by most people's standards, it wasn't the path she wanted for herself. She wanted to be a highly regarded classical pianist, and she was very gifted. However, Curtis Institute of Music school rejected her, in what is now widely believed to be due to racism. What life could she have had if the world did not rob her of that genius? What could her contribution to the world have looked like?\n\nUnfortunately Miss Nina Simone is not the last lost genius, and won’t be for a while as long as racism, sexism and a bunch of other ism’s continue to exist.\n\nA lot of things aren’t created because it doesn’t make money or doesn’t make enough money to sustain its own cost. It makes you wonder what wonderful things we are all missing out on because of this. Fortunately this is a problem that is getting more attention via the creation of more lenient grant giving organizations. Still, there isn’t enough, hence why it is on this list.\n\nScale of impact as an incentive\n\nSimilar to what has been written above, a lot of things aren’t created because its impact won’t reach a large enough scale. Again, the question is what wonderful things are multiple individuals missing out on because of this?\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Thorn was founded in 2012 by Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore to combat online child abuse. Potts adds, \"We built Spotlight because we wanted to use advanced technology to help law enforcement turn the tables and find these children faster.\"\n\nSpotlight's sophisticated machine-learning capabilities save time for overworked, under-resourced investigators by automatically flagging ads likely to represent at-risk children and keeping law enforcement agents from getting lost in a sea of online data. The app does this on a serverless Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture that includes Amazon Rekognition , a deep learning–based image and video analysis service, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) C5 instances .

The organization collaborates with law enforcement agencies, tech companies, and nonprofits. A virtual team based in the U.S., Thorn employs 25 people.\n\nA 2012 Thorn survey of child sex-trafficking survivors found that 75 percent had been sold online, most of them through escort websites. One way for law enforcement agents to catch traffickers and rescue kids would be to identify and investigate escort ads that seem to feature minors, but there are many obstacles to doing this.\n\nOne of the most significant obstacles is the massive volume of these ads. As Thorn started work on a tool that could help investigators identify children being exploited, more than 150,000 new escort ads were being posted online every day in the United States. Problems of scale like this cry out for automated processes, but another big obstacle is the fact that escort ad data is anything but consistent: traffickers use code words, slang, and reused content to complicate detection by machines.\n\nTo help investigators overcome these and other hurdles, Thorn collaborated with AWS and Digital Reasoning, a company specializing in cognitive-computing solutions, to build Spotlight. Spotlight's machine-learning models analyze new escort ads in real time and use intelligent image analysis and natural-language processing (NLP) to flag those that match risk profiles developed in cooperation with law enforcement agencies. Officers can set customized alerts and search Spotlight’s constantly growing database of ads to aid in their investigations.\n\nSpotlight’s analytics pipeline begins with a third-party solution that ingests more than 100,000 new online escort ads each day, storing text and image data as objects in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets. AWS Lambda functions orchestrate Amazon Simple Queueing Service (Amazon SQS) to queue new ads for processing by the app's analytics engine, Digital Reasoning Synthesys. The solution uses Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send alerts to law enforcement agents.\n\nSpotlight's machine-learning models are trained and run on Amazon EC2 C5 instances. Powered by 3.0 GHz Intel Xeon Scalable processors, Amazon EC2 C5 instances offer a memory-to-vCPU ratio that is ideal for demanding inference applications. Spotlight, which is offered free of charge to law enforcement and allied organizations, uses Amazon Cognito to provide a secure user directory that can scale to millions of users.\n\nAmazon Rekognition, which uses deep learning to accurately identify objects, people, activities, and events in images and videos stored in Amazon S3, is at the heart of one of Spotlight’s most crucial capabilities. Facial analysis in Amazon Rekognition helps investigators find photos of the same person that have been edited to defeat less intelligent image-search engines.\n\n\"We tested multiple facial-recognition services and found Amazon Rekognition was extremely accurate,\" says Kristin Boorse, the director of product management for Thorn. \"It didn't make sense to build our own facial-recognition service when AWS already offers a best-in-breed solution like Amazon Rekognition. The Amazon Rekognition team has been very responsive in helping us address any challenges we encounter.\"\n\nSince 2016 alone, Spotlight has helped officers in the United States and Canada open more than 21,000 trafficking cases and identify about 18,000 victims, including more than 6,000 children.\n\n\"Our law enforcement partners say Spotlight helps officers identify child sex-trafficking ads much faster than the old paper-and-pencil methods,\" says Brooke Istook, director of strategy and operations at Thorn. \"With the flexibility and easy integration of AWS, we can experiment and prototype new products like Spotlight that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive to develop. On AWS, we can also respond to feature requests from officers in weeks or days—not a level of responsiveness public-sector agencies are used to seeing.\"\n\nCombating online child sex trafficking is a team effort, according to Istook. \" All of our technology partners are making crucial contributions to this fight. Spotlight could never have been so successful without substantial investment and support from AWS, or the underlying technologies that Intel has created.”\n\nAWS support for Internet Explorer ends on 07/31/2022.

But many critical insights will only emerge in the context of a serious creative problem that’s not about the system itself. This is a key claim of Insight through making .\n\nThat sounds like standard practice: of course systems have to be evaluated! But most system designers don’t take “serious” seriously: Tool-makers usually lack connection to a serious context of use . Observing how your theories (represented in systems) interact with reality can yield insights which help improve your theories. The character of those insights will depend on the context in which the system was used. If the system isn’t used seriously, the insights will be more like those which a pure theorist could have seen. Those were possible without actually building a system.\n\nPixar’s a good example of an organization which creates serious contexts of use, which in turn drive system design: Pixar’s movies and technology development act as coupled flywheels .\n\nGreat tool-makers are often not great tool-users, and vice-versa\n\nGroups researching tools for thought need enough capacity to build prototypes suitable for serious work\n\nPowerful enabling environments usually arise as a byproduct of projects pursuing their own intrinsically meaningful purposes\n\nMatuschak, A., \u0026 Nielsen, M. (2019). How can we develop transformative tools for thought? Retrieved December 2, 2019, from https://numinous.productions/ttft\n\nConcretely: suppose you want to build tools for subject X (say X = differential geometry). Unless you are deeply involved in practicing that subject, it’s going to be extremely difficult to build good tools. It’ll be much like trying to build new tools for carpentry without actually doing any carpentry yourself. This is perhaps part of why tools like Mathematica work quite well – the principal designer, Stephen Wolfram, has genuine research interests in mathematics and physics. Of course, not all parts of Mathematica work equally well; some parts feel like toys, and it seems likely those are the ones not being used seriously internal to the company.\n\nIt aims us at relevant problems, not just exercises or toy-scale problems. It keeps us honest about success and failure, so that we don’t fool ourselves so easily. It makes us face the wholeproblem, not just the easy or mathematical parts. In computational geometry, for example, we can’t avoid the cases of collinear point triples or coplanar point quadru- ples. We can’t assume away ill-conditioned cases. Facing the whole problem in turn forces us to learn or develop new computer science, often in areas we otherwise never would have addressed. Besides all of that, it is just plain fun to look over the shoulders of those discovering how proteins work, or designing submarines, or fabricating on the nanometer scale.\n\nSoftware-based researchers often strive to build systems containing high-level ideas that are likely to generalize, since those make for more compelling academic papers. However, we believe that trying to be too general actually hinders scale and sustainability. To build long-lasting software that can organically grow a large userbase, one must instead start specific.\n\nIn 2009 we created Python Tutor with a very specific goal in mind: to provide a convenient way for students and instructors (such as ourselves) to walk through Python code step-by-step and see the values of variables.\n\nThe Apollo program was an incredibly powerful Enabling environment , but it did not emerge from a project aiming to give scientists lots of great opportunities for personal growth. Rather, it was about putting people on the moon (and, er, saving the world from the Soviets). The enabling environment was a byproduct of that deeply meaningful effort.\n\nLikewise, when Pixar created its revolutionary animation tools, many teams had been working on computer graphics for years, but Pixar’s systems emerged from a zealous pursuit of a storytelling dream: Pixar’s movies and technology development act as coupled flywheels .\n\nCathedrals! University research labs! Mathematica! They all follow this pattern.\n\nPractically speaking, such contexts provide deeply meaningful feedback: Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious contexts of use . They also avoid the issues described in Authored environments are significantly colored by authors’ motivations . But perhaps most importantly, these projects also provide the intense personal connection which makes great work possible.\n\nIs it possible to make the tail wag the dog? To initiate a project pursuing some intrinsically meaningful purpose in order to reap the enabling environments which emerge in that context? It’s not clear. The most likely failure mode is that the resulting project wouldn’t really create the intense personal connection required. But this is what we’re trying for with Ladder .\n\nBuilding on Seymour Papert. (2005). You Can’t Think About Thinking Without Thinking About Thinking About Something. Contemporary Issues in Technology and Teacher Education, 5(3), 366–367. : you can’t teach children “logical thinking” in a vacuum, in an abstract sense; in the same way, you can’t make “tools for thought” in an abstract sense. You have to make a tool for thinking about something in particular; likewise, you have to understand logical thinking about something in particular.\n\nThe most powerful tools are not developed in isolation. Rather, they arise as part of projects done for their own, intrinsic reasons. Think of the art of stained glass windows, developed in service of God in the great cathedrals. Or of the development of computer animation in service of story by Pixar. These larger goals orient the development of the tools, ensuring they can be used seriously. This sounds like a platitude, but is often violated. “Tools” for mathematics or art or etc are often developed by people who are not deeply active in the area themselves. Unless they do extremely intensive user research—effectively, a collaboration with serious users—it’s extremely difficult for them to build anything other than plausible-seeming toys.\n\nTo this end, we will develop a series of ambitious media projects. These will—indeed, must!—be intrinsically worth doing in their own right. But they will also serve as a vehicle for the development of tools for thought.\n\nDNA origami is a powerful emerging tool; it didn’t come out of a field centered on tool-making, but rather Paul Rothemund invented it as a means to the end of making self-assembling computers. The Scanning Tunneling Microscope didn’t come out of the field of microscopy, but rather Heinrich Rohrer wanted to help his colleagues fabricate Josephson junctions and needed a better spectrometer. (see also Shawn Douglas on DNA origami)\n\nQuote from Alan Kay in that same email:\n\n::I don’t think you can start with “text” or “programming” and get very far::. I think it’s always better to have something important and big you want to do better with — eventually this provides clues to various kinds of media (including “languages”) that need to be invented to help. This is what people miss. McCarthy wasn’t trying to invent Lisp, he was trying to create ways to make an “Advice Taker”. Doug wasn’t trying to do hypertext, he was trying to synergize human effort for good.","tokenFrequency":{"use":7,"compel":1,"order":1,"mean":1,"goal":2,"interest":1,"transform":1,"abstract":2,"physic":1,"depend":1,"growth":1,"often":5,"issu":2,"look":1,"give":1,"god":1,"enabl":4,"make":9,"users—it":1,"provid":4,"howev":1,"realiti":1,"instructor":1,"wasn't":2,"servic":2,"sens":2,"project":7,"sinc":1,"build":9,"code":1,"kay":1,"tunnel":1,"–":1,"zealous":1,"synerg":1,"thought":3,"worth":1,"coplanar":1,"53":1,"environ":5,"prototyp":2,"help":3,"serious":10,"human":1,"sound":2,"thought”":1,"it'll":1,"repres":1,"vacuum":1,"capac":1,"quit":1,"point":2,"ambiti":1,"improv":1,"strive":1,"signific":1,"connect":3,"retriev":1,"research":4,"coupl":2,"email":1,"instead":1,"mathematica":3,"great":6,"byproduct":2,"matuschak":1,"“advic":1,"must":1,"claim":1,"we'r":1,"origami":2,"apollo":1,"thinking”":1,"initi":1,"research—effect":1,"etc":1,"believ":1,"ples":1,"relev":1,"feel":1,"storytel":1,"tool":12,"observ":1,"highlevel":1,"student":1,"rohrer":1,"mani":2,"come":2,"viceversa":1,"meaning":4,"must—b":1,"tripl":1,"success":1,"toyscal":1,"specif":2,"actual":3,"without":3,"pure":1,"dog":1,"collabor":1,"wholeproblem":1,"opportun":1,"longlast":1,"suitabl":1,"result":1,"python":2,"interact":1,"center":1,"lot":1,"intrins":4,"difficult":2,"pixar":6,"reason":1,"genuin":1,"realli":1,"intern":1,"design":5,"way":3,"go":1,"pattern":1,"forc":1,"evalu":2,"scienc":1,"er":1,"stepbystep":1,"“text”":1,"wouldn't":1,"fun":1,"usual":2,"flywheel":2,"“logic":1,"suppos":1,"that":1,"group":1,"save":1,"media":2,"“tool":1,"logic":1,"—":1,"big":1,"soviet":1,"enough":1,"illcondit":1,"insight":6,"theorist":1,"system":11,"new":2,"softwar":1,"taker”":1,"mind":1,"purpos":2,"program":1,"toolus":1,"comput":5,"paul":1,"see":2,"intens":3,"ensur":1,"never":1,"2005":1,"emerg":5,"critic":1,"concret":1,"think":9,"besid":1,"plausibleseem":1,"httpsnuminousproductionsttft":1,"window":1,"366–367":1,"carpentri":2,"it":3,"tri":7,"softwarebas":1,"art":2,"“tools”":1,"selfassembl":1,"effort":2,"develop":11,"organ":2,"peopl":3,"wag":1,"deepli":4,"paper":1,"easili":1,"face":2,"submarin":1,"exercis":1,"area":2,"plain":1,"miss":1,"better":3,"far":1,"vehicl":1,"differenti":1,"drive":1,"someth":4,"technolog":3,"stori":1,"various":1,"colleagu":1,"univers":1,"anim":2,"assum":1,"spectromet":1,"stephen":1,"general":2,"involv":1,"":30,"dna":2,"alway":1,"mode":1,"us":4,"kind":1,"decemb":1,"allow":1,"microscop":1,"take":1,"speak":1,"effect":1,"clue":1,"practic":3,"seem":1,"heinrich":1,"larg":1,"context":7,"josephson":1,"tutor":1,"like":9,"nielsen":1,"fabric":2,"“serious”":1,"alan":1,"aim":2,"grow":1,"includ":1,"moon":1,"glass":1,"teacher":1,"failur":2,"well":2,"seen":1,"toolmak":3,"learn":1,"variabl":1,"discov":1,"team":1,"scrappi":2,"address":1,"invent":3,"drawn":1,"protein":1,"iter":1,"stain":1,"away":1,"rather":4,"doug":1,"want":3,"can't":5,"avoid":2,"put":1,"follow":1,"charact":1,"exampl":2,"junction":1,"easi":1,"motiv":1,"theori":2,"keep":1,"cathedr":2,"could":1,"seri":1,"author":2,"mccarthi":1,"pursuit":1,"aris":2,"act":2,"incred":1,"eventu":1,"don't":3,"contain":1,"unless":2,"quot":1,"isol":1,"year":1,"requir":2,"case":2,"orient":1,"work":6,"quadru":1,"isn't":1,"honest":1,"cours":2,"feedback":1,"person":3,"movi":2,"anyth":1,"subject":2,"collinear":1,"didn't":2,"scan":1,"lack":1,"walk":1,"otherwis":1,"dream":1,"ladder":1,"quick":1,"possibl":3,"userbas":1,"likewis":2,"microscopi":1,"perhap":2,"say":1,"conveni":1,"start":2,"done":1,"color":1,"user":1,"standard":1,"shawn":1,"“languages”":1,"platitud":1,"world":1,"dougla":1,"right":1,"describ":1,"violat":1,"2019":2,"nanomet":1,"part":5,"fool":1,"reap":1,"tail":1,"contemporari":1,"princip":1,"power":4,"import":2,"scale":2,"hinder":1,"serv":1,"will—inde":1,"toy":2,"whole":1,"mathemat":3,"geometri":2,"creativ":1,"good":3,"seymour":1,"lab":1,"idea":1,"also":4,"2009":1,"problem":4,"graphic":1,"children":1,"activ":1,"key":1,"papert":1,"one":2,"sustain":1,"understand":1,"teach":1,"scientist":1,"valu":1,"yield":1,"would":1,"hypertext":1,"creat":5,"wolfram":1,"get":1,"shoulder":1,"compani":1,"end":2,"pursu":2,"rothemund":1,"educ":1,"academ":1,"revolutionari":1,"turn":2,"“programming”":1,"need":3,"particular":2,"clear":1,"lisp":1,"field":2,"equal":1,"extrem":3,"much":1,"larger":1}},"20450":{"id":"20450","title":"The 3 Levels of Wealth","link":"https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2018/08/the-3-levels-of-wealth","content":"Slack is a lot like Twitter from my vantage point.\n\nIt’s a service I use all the time. It’s become an integral part of my life from both a work and social perspective. Every time I talk to someone else who uses the service they share my love for the platform. And it’s almost impossible to explain its usefulness to someone who has never used it before.\n\nSlack has been one of the big reasons RWM is able to have offices around the country. It’s more or less replaced internal email at our firm and allowed us to more effectively communicate and share ideas with one another across state lines and time zones.\n\nThe initial idea behind the messaging company was actually something of a fluke.\n\nStewart Butterfield and team had tried unsuccessfully for a number of years to get a multiplayer online game off the ground. When he finally pulled the plug and shut down the effort, he realized their next venture could come from the communications system they used while setting up the game.\n\nThat communication platform allowed various members of the team to have conversations on different topics, in different groups and archived every conversation so they could look back if necessary. In 2012, this became Slack, which now has upwards of 8 million daily users.\n\nThe company was valued at $5 billion after its last round of fundraising, making founder Butterfield a rich man.\n\nOn a recent episode of How I Built This with Guy Raz , Butterfield was asked how this enormous wealth has impacted his life. He told Raz, “beyond a certain level of wealth it doesn’t make your life any better.”\n\nHe went on to list what he considers to be the three levels of wealth:\n\nLevel 1. I’m not stressed out about debt: People who no longer have to worry about their credit card debt or student loans.\n\nLevel 2. I don’t care what stuff costs in restaurants: How much you spend on a particular meal isn’t impacted by your finances.\n\nLevel 3. I don’t care what a vacation costs: People who don’t care how expensive the hotel is or which flight they go on.\n\nThis was a new way of looking at this and it got me thinking about where most Americans find themselves on this scale.\n\nData from a recent report from the Congressional Budget Office shows people at the top of the income scale have experienced the most gains in their ability to not care about vacation costs since 1979:\n\nThe top 20% of earners saw their income rise almost 70% while the top 1% was three times higher than that. While the top 20% saw gains of almost 70%, the bottom 80% saw gains of just 27%.\n\nData from Pew Research breaks down the share of households in five different income levels since the 1970s:\n\nIt appears there are more people who don’t have to worry about how much they spend on vacations, fewer people who don’t have to worry about how much they spend at a restaurant and more people who have to worry about debt.\n\nOn the one hand, it’s nice that more people are now in the upper middle and highest income brackets than in the 70s and 80s. On the other hand, it’s not a great look that there are now more people on the lowest rung.\n\nThe middle class has seen the greatest decline in this time, but according to a Gallup poll , most people in the upper class don’t even realize they’ve made it to the top:\n\nPew also broke things out in terms of middle and upper-income classes by the number of people in a household:\n\nThe fact that you need to make more money to support a larger family could be one of the reasons fertility rates are dropping so precipitously in the U.S.\n\nIncome is not the same thing as wealth, so it makes sense to look at the net worth numbers as well.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve , as of 2016, the average net worth of American families is just shy of $100,000. But the median wealth for the top 10% is over $1.6 million while the top 1% holds almost 40% of the country’s wealth.\n\nThe Fed also broke out the net worth figures by various percentiles:\n\nThe Great Recession and the ensuing recovery have had a massive impact on household wealth depending on where you fall. The Minneapolis Fed just released a study that shows how damaging the crisis was on the bottom 50% and how wonderfully the top 10% has made out:\n\nMuch of this wealth disparity comes from the fact that the top 10% of households own 84% of the stock market, which is up from 77% in the early-2000s. I’m afraid two enormous crashes over a 10 year period has likely led an entire segment of the population to shun the stock market for good.\n\nThese charts don’t tell the whole story of course.\n\nThe standard of living where you choose to reside can have a huge impact on how far any of these income or wealth numbers can get you. And how much or how little you choose to spend of that income or wealth also plays a role. Lifestyle inflation can be a killer if you’re not careful, no matter how much money you make.\n\nButterfield’s three levels of wealth aren’t all-inclusive but I like the fact that he frames them in personal finance terms people can understand.

Here’s why not much has changed—and what might actually work.\n\nOne weekday morning in 2007, Bethanye Blount came into work early to interview a job applicant. A veteran software engineer then in her 30s, Blount held a senior position at the company that runs Second Life, the online virtual world. Good-natured and self-confident, she typically wore the kind of outfit—jeans, hoodie, sneakers—that signals coding gravitas. That day, she might even have been wearing what’s known as the “full-in start-up twin set”: a Second Life T-shirt paired with a Second Life hoodie.\n\nIn short, everything about her indicated that she was a serious technical person. So she was taken aback when the job applicant barely gave her the time of day. He knew her job title. He knew she would play a key role in deciding whether he got hired. Yet every time Blount asked him a question about his skills or tried to steer the conversation to the scope of the job, he blew her off with a flippant comment. Afterward, Blount spoke to another top woman—a vice president—who said he’d treated her the same way.\n\nObviously Second Life wasn’t going to hire this bozo. But what the heck: He was here, and they had a new employee, a man, who needed practice giving interviews, so they sent him in. When the employee emerged, he had an odd look on his face. “I don’t know what just happened,” he said. “I went in there and told him I was new, and all he said was he was so glad I was there: ‘Finally, somebody who knows what’s going on!’ ”\n\nAll Blount could do was laugh—even now, as she looks back on the incident. In the hierarchy of sexist encounters, it didn’t rank very high. Still, it was a reminder that as a woman in tech, she should be prepared to have her authority questioned at any moment, even by some guy trying to get a job at her company.\n\nOne reason her career had gone so well, she thinks, is that she’d made a point of ignoring slights and oafish comments. Awkward silences, too. Over the years, she’s experienced—many times—the sensation of walking up to a group of male colleagues and noticing that they fell quiet, as though they’d been talking about something they didn’t want her to hear. She’s been asked to take notes in meetings. She’s found herself standing in elevators at tech conferences late at night when a guy would decide to get, as she puts it, handsy. When she and a male partner started a company, potential investors almost always directed their questions to him—even when the subject clearly fell in Blount’s area of expertise. It drove him crazy, and Blount had to urge him to curb his irritation. “I didn’t have time to be pissed,” she says.\n\nBut at some point, something inside her broke. Maybe it was being at tech conferences and hearing herself, the “elder stateswoman,” warning younger women to cover their drinks, because such conferences—known for alcohol, after-parties, and hot women at product booths—have been breeding grounds for unwanted sexual advances and assaults, and you never knew whether some jerk might put something in your cocktail. She couldn’t believe that women still had to worry about such things; that they still got asked to fetch coffee; that she still heard talk about how hiring women or people of color entailed “lowering the bar”; that women still, often, felt silenced or attacked when expressing opinions online.\n\n“I am angry that things are no better for a 22-year-old at the beginning of her career than they were for me 25 years ago when I was just starting out,” Blount says. “I made decisions along the way that were easier for me and helped me succeed—don’t bring attention to being a woman, never talk about gender, never talk about ‘these things’ with men,” unless the behavior was particularly egregious. “It helped me get through. But in retrospect I feel I should have done more.”\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nBlount decided it was never too late to start speaking out, and teamed up with other women who had undergone a similar awakening. This past May, they formed a group called Project Include , which aims to provide companies and investors with a template for how to be better. One of her collaborators on the effort, Susan Wu, an entrepreneur and investor, says that when she was teaching herself to code as a teenager, she was too naive to perceive the sexism of internet culture. But as she advanced in her career and moved into investing and big-money venture capitalism, she came to see the elaborate jiu-jitsu it takes for a woman to hold her own. At one party, the founder of a start-up told Wu she’d need to spend “intimate time” with him to get in on his deal. An angel investor leading a different deal told her something similar. She became a master of warm, but firm, self-extrication.\n\nLooking back, Wu is struck by “the countless times I’ve had to move a man’s hand from my thigh (or back or shoulder or hair or arm) during a meeting (or networking event or professional lunch or brainstorming session or pitch meeting) without seeming confrontational (or bitchy or rejecting or demanding or aggressive).” In a land of grand ideas and grander funding proposals, she found that the ability to neatly reject a man’s advances without injuring his ego is “a pretty important skill that I would bet most successful women in our industry have.”\n\nWu learned how to calibrate the temperature of her demeanor: friendly and approachable, neither too intimate nor too distant. She learned the fine art of the three-quarters smile, as well as how to deflect conversation away from her personal life and return it to topics like sports and market strategy. She learned to distinguish between actual predators and well-meaning guys who were just a bit clueless. And yet to not be overly wary, because that, too, can affect career prospects.\n\nThe dozens of women I interviewed for this article love working in tech. They love the problem-solving, the camaraderie, the opportunity for swift advancement and high salaries, the fun of working with the technology itself. They appreciate their many male colleagues who are considerate and supportive. Yet all of them had stories about incidents that, no matter how quick or glancing, chipped away at their sense of belonging and expertise. Indeed, a recent survey called “ Elephant in the Valley ” found that nearly all of the 200-plus senior women in tech who responded had experienced sexist interactions. (And just as the print version of this article went to press, a former Uber engineer added to the evidence of Silicon Valley’s gender problem when she wrote a blog post detailing what she said was a pattern of sexist behavior at the company.)\n\nAs Bethanye Blount’s and Susan Wu’s examples show, succeeding in tech as a woman requires something more treacherous than the old adage about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, only backwards and in high heels. It’s more like doing everything backwards and in heels while some guy is trying to yank at your dress, and another is telling you that a woman can’t dance as well as a man, oh, and could you stop dancing for a moment and bring him something to drink?\n\nSuch undermining is one reason women today hold only about a quarter of U.S. computing and mathematical jobs—a fraction that has actually fallen slightly over the past 15 years, even as women have made big strides in other fields. Women not only are hired in lower numbers than men are; they also leave tech at more than twice the rate men do. It’s not hard to see why. Studies show that women who work in tech are interrupted in meetings more often than men. They are evaluated on their personality in a way that men are not. They are less likely to get funding from venture capitalists, who, studies also show, find pitches delivered by men—especially handsome men—more persuasive. And in a particularly cruel irony, women’s contributions to open-source software are accepted more often than men’s are, but only if their gender is unknown.\n\nFor women of color, the cumulative effect of these slights is compounded by a striking lack of racial diversity—and all that attends it. Stephanie Lampkin, who was a full-stack developer (meaning she had mastered both front-end and back-end systems) by age 15 and majored in engineering at Stanford, has been told when applying for a job that she’s “not technical enough” and should consider sales or marketing—an experience many white women in the field can relate to. But she has also, for instance, been told by a white woman at a conference that her name ought to be Ebony because of the color of her skin.\n\nIn the past several years, Silicon Valley has begun to grapple with these problems, or at least to quantify them. In 2014, Google released data on the number of women and minorities it employed. Other companies followed, including LinkedIn, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, eBay, and Apple. The numbers were not good, and neither was the resulting news coverage, but the companies pledged to spend hundreds of millions of dollars changing their work climates, altering the composition of their leadership, and refining their hiring practices.\n\nAt long last, the industry that has transformed how we learn, think, buy, travel, cook, socialize, live, love, and work seemed ready to turn its disruptive instincts to its own gender inequities—and in the process develop tools and best practices that other, less forward-looking industries could copy, thus improving the lives of working women everywhere.\n\nThree years in, Silicon Valley diversity conferences and training sessions abound; a cottage industry of consultants and software makers has sprung up to offer solutions. Some of those fixes have already started filtering out to workplaces beyond the tech world, because Silicon Valley is nothing if not evangelical. But the transformation hasn’t yet materialized: The industry’s diversity numbers have barely budged, and many women say that while sexism has become somewhat less overt, it’s just as pernicious as ever. Even so, there may be reason for hope as companies begin to figure out what works—and what doesn’t.\n\nWhen Silicon Valley was emerging, after World War II, software programming was considered rote and unglamorous, somewhat secretarial—and therefore suitable for women. The glittering future, it was thought, lay in hardware. But once software revealed its potential—and profitability—the guys flooded in and coding became a male realm.\n\nThe advent of the home computer may have hastened this shift. Early models like the Commodore 64 and the Apple IIc were often marketed as toys. According to Jane Margolis, a researcher at UCLA, families bought them and put them in their sons’ rooms, even when they had technologically inclined daughters. By the time the children of the ’80s and ’90s reached college, many of the boys already knew how to code. Fewer girls did.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. Consider where we are today. More than half of college and university students are women, and the percentage of women entering many stem fields has risen. Computer science is a glaring exception: The percentage of female computer- and information-science majors peaked in 1984, at about 37 percent. It has declined, more or less steadily, ever since. Today it stands at 18 percent.\n\nClaudia Goldin, a Harvard economist, told me that tech would seem to be an attractive field for women, since many companies promise the same advantages—flexibility and reasonable hours—that have drawn women in droves to other professions that were once nearly all male. The big tech companies also offer family-friendly perks like generous paid parental leave; new moms at Google, for instance, get 22 paid weeks. “These should be the best jobs for people who want predictability and flexibility,” Goldin said. “So what’s happening?”\n\nA report by the Center for Talent Innovation found that when women drop out of tech, it’s usually not for family reasons. Nor do they drop out because they dislike the work—to the contrary, they enjoy it and in many cases take new jobs in sectors where they can use their technical skills. Rather, the report concludes that “workplace conditions, a lack of access to key creative roles, and a sense of feeling stalled in one’s career” are the main reasons women leave. “Undermining behavior from managers” is a major factor.\n\nThe hostility of the culture is such an open secret that tweets and essays complaining of sexism tend to begin with a disclaimer acknowledging how shopworn the subject feels. “My least favorite topic in the world is ‘Women in Tech,’ so I am going to make this short,” wrote one blogger, noting that after she started speaking at conferences and contributing to open-source projects, she began to get threatening and abusive emails, including from men who said they “jerked off to my conference talk video.” Another woman tweeted that, while waiting to make a presentation at Pubcon, a prestigious conference, she was told by a male attendee, “Don’t be nervous. You’re hot! No one expects you to do well.”\n\nIn the office, sexism typically takes a subtler form. The women I spoke with described a kind of gaslighting: They find themselves in enviably modern workspaces, surrounded by right-thinking colleagues and much talk of meritocracy, yet feel disparaged in ways that are hard to articulate, let alone prove.\n\nTelle Whitney, the president and CEO of the Anita Borg Institute, a nonprofit that supports women in technology, says gender bias is a big problem in start-ups, which are frequently run by brotherhoods of young men—in many cases friends or roommates—straight out of elite colleges. In 2014, for instance, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel was two years out of Stanford and already leading a $10 billion company when his frat-boy-at-his-misogynistic-worst undergraduate emails were published and went viral. In them, his only slightly younger self joked about shooting lasers at “fat girls,” described a Stanford dean as “dean-julie-show-us-your-tits,” and for good measure, saluted another fraternity because it had decided to “stop being gay.”\n\nBut while start-ups may be the worst offenders, it’s notable how often the staid older companies also make missteps. Just last year, Microsoft hosted a party that featured “schoolgirl” dancers wearing short uniform-type skirts and bra tops, dancing on podiums. The event followed the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco—where, earlier that day, the company had sponsored a Women in Gaming Luncheon to promote a culture of inclusivity.\n\nAnd then there are the public utterances that reveal what some leading men in tech think of women and their abilities. When Sir Michael Moritz, the chair of Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley’s most venerable venture-capital firms, was asked by a Bloomberg reporter why the firm had no female investing partners in the U.S., he responded, “We look very hard,” adding that the firm had “hired a young woman from Stanford who’s every bit as good as her peers.” But, he added, “what we’re not prepared to do is to lower our standards.”\n\nWhen Ellen Pao sued another prominent venture-capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield \u0026 Byers, for gender discrimination, the 2015 trial sent a frisson through the tech world. Former Yahoo President Sue Decker wrote an essay for Recode , the tech-industry website, saying that she had been obsessively following the trial because it resonated so deeply with her. She took her daughters out of school to hear the closing arguments. “I, and most women I know, have been a party to at least some sexist or discriminatory behavior in the workplace,” she wrote, explaining that she and many other women had witnessed things like “locker-room discussion during travel with colleagues,” which they tried to brush aside, since “any individual act seems silly to complain about.” The Pao trial, however, shifted her attitude.\n\nPao lost the case, but the trial was a watershed. Afterward, a group of seven senior women in tech conducted the “Elephant in the Valley” survey. Eighty-four percent of the respondents had been told they were too aggressive; 66 percent had felt excluded from key networking opportunities because of their gender; 90 percent had witnessed sexist behavior at conferences and company off-site meetings; 88 percent had had clients and colleagues direct questions to male peers that should have been addressed to them; and 60 percent had fended off unwanted sexual advances (in most cases from a superior). Of those women, one-third said they had feared for their personal safety.\n\nPao went on to co-found Project Include with Blount, Wu, and others, including Tracy Chou. A software engineer who graduated from Stanford, Chou told me about working at a start-up where a co-founder would often muse that a man they’d just hired would turn out to be better and faster than she was. When Chou discovered a significant flaw in the company’s code and pointed it out, her engineering team dismissed her concerns, saying that they had been using the code for long enough that any problems would have been discovered. Chou persisted, saying she could demonstrate the conditions under which the bug was triggered. Finally, a male co-worker saw that she was right and raised the alarm, whereupon people in the office began to listen. Chou told her team that she knew how to fix the flaw; skeptical, they told her to have two other engineers review the changes and sign off on them, an unusual precaution. Her co-workers rationalized their scrutiny by explaining that the bug was important, and so was the fix.\n\n“I knew it was important,” she told me recently. “That’s why I was trying to flag it.”\n\nFor Chou, even the open-office floor plan was stressful: It meant there was no way to escape a male co-worker who liked to pop up behind her and find fault with her work. She was called “emotional” when she raised technical concerns and was expected to be nice and never complain, even as people around her made excuses for male engineers who were difficult to work with. The company’s one other female engineer felt the same way Chou did—as if they were held to a different standard. It wasn’t overt sexism; it was more like being dismissed and disrespected, “not feeling like we were good enough to be there—even though, objectively speaking, we were.”\n\nThat the tech industry would prove so hostile to women is more than a little counterintuitive. Silicon Valley is populated with progressive, hyper-educated people who talk a lot about making the world better. It’s also a young field, with none of the history of, say, law or medicine, where women were long denied spots in graduate schools intended for “breadwinning men.”\n\n“We don’t have the same histories of exclusion,” says Joelle Emerson, the founder and CEO of Paradigm, a firm in San Francisco that advises companies on diversity and inclusion. But being new comes with its own problems: Because Silicon Valley is a place where a newcomer can unseat the most established player, many people there believe—despite evidence everywhere to the contrary—that tech is a meritocracy. Ironically enough, this very belief can perpetuate inequality. A 2010 study, “The Paradox of Meritocracy in Organizations,” found that in cultures that espouse meritocracy, managers may in fact “show greater bias in favor of men over equally performing women.” In a series of three experiments, the researchers presented participants with profiles of similarly performing individuals of both genders, and asked them to award bonuses. The researchers found that telling participants that their company valued merit-based decisions only increased the likelihood of their giving higher bonuses to the men.\n\nSuch bias may be particularly rife in Silicon Valley because of another of its foundational beliefs: that success in tech depends almost entirely on innate genius. Nobody thinks that of lawyers or accountants or even brain surgeons; while some people clearly have more aptitude than others, it’s accepted that law school is where you learn law and that preparing for and passing the CPA exam is how you become a certified accountant. Surgeons are trained, not born. In contrast, a 2015 study published in Science confirmed that computer science and certain other fields, including physics, math, and philosophy, fetishize “brilliance,” cultivating the idea that potential is inborn. The report concluded that these fields tend to be problematic for women, owing to a stubborn assumption that genius is a male trait.\n\nThe study authors considered several alternative explanations for the low numbers of women in those fields—including that women might not want to work long hours and that there might be more men at the high end of the aptitude spectrum, an idea notoriously put forward in 2005 by then–Harvard President Larry Summers.\n\nBut the data did not support these other theories.\n\n“The more a field valued giftedness, the fewer the female PhDs,” the study found, pointing out that the same pattern held for African Americans. Because both groups still tend to be “stereotyped as lacking innate intellectual talent,” the study concluded, “the extent to which practitioners of a discipline believe that success depends on sheer brilliance is a strong predictor of women’s and African Americans’ representation.”\n\nThat may be why, for years, the tech industry’s gender disparity was considered almost a natural thing. When Tracy Chou was an intern at Google in 2007, she says, people would joke about the fact that the main Mountain View campus was populated mostly by male engineers, and that women tended to be relegated to other parts of the operation, such as marketing. But for all the joking, Chou says, it was strangely difficult to have a conversation about why that was, how women felt about it, and how it could be changed.\n\nIn October 2013, Chou attended the Grace Hopper conference, an annual gathering for women in computing, where Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, warned that the number of women in tech was falling. Chou was startled. She realized that for such a data-driven industry, few reliable diversity statistics were available. That same month, she wrote a post on Medium in which she called on people to share data from their own companies, and she set up a spreadsheet where they could do so. “This thing that had been an open secret in Silicon Valley became open to everybody,” Chou told me.\n\nAt the time, some of the big tech firms were fighting a Freedom of Information Act request from the San Jose Mercury News asking the Department of Labor to release data on the makeup of their workforces. The companies contended that such statistics were a trade secret, and that exposing them would hurt their competitive edge. But Chou was not the only voice calling for transparency. Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow push Coalition were advocating on behalf of both women and people of color, and activist investors began pressuring companies to reveal information about salaries and gender pay gaps.\n\nIn January 2015, in a keynote speech at the International Consumer Electronics Show, in Las Vegas, Brian Krzanich, the CEO of Intel, announced that his company would devote $300 million to diversity efforts over the next five years. Two months later, Apple pledged $50 million to partner with nonprofits that work to improve the pipeline of women and minorities going into tech, and that spring Google announced that it would increase its annual budget for promoting diversity from $115 million to $150 million. This past June, 33 companies signed a pledge to make their workforces more diverse.\n\nAccording to Nancy Lee, Google’s vice president of people operations until she retired in February, the company saw both a business imperative—it is, after all, designing a global product—and a moral one. She points to the “original vision” of Google’s founders, which was that “we’re going to build this company for the long haul. We’re not going to be evil.” Google released detailed information on its workforce, and because “our numbers weren’t great,” Lee told me, other companies felt safe releasing theirs. Google wanted to disclose its data, she said, because “then we’re on the hook. There’s no turning back.”\n\nIndeed. At Google, the initial tally showed that just 17 percent of its technical employees were women. The female technical force was 10 percent at Twitter, 15 percent at Facebook, and 20 percent at Apple. Granted, women currently make up just 18 percent of computer-science majors, but these companies are so well funded and attractive that they should be able to get a disproportionate percentage of the pipeline. The firms resolved to do better, and began looking for new ways to attract and retain women. Their approaches include measures like recruiting from a broader array of colleges and creating more internships. But the flashiest—and most copied—approach is something called unconscious-bias training.\n\nLately, unconscious-bias training has emerged as a ubiquitous fix for Silicon Valley’s diversity deficit. It’s diversity training for the new millennium, in which people are made aware of their own hidden biases. It rests on a large body of social-psychology research—hundreds of studies showing how women and minorities are stereotyped. Google turned to it, Lee told me, in part because the company felt that its engineers would appreciate an approach grounded in social science: “That sort of discipline really, really resonated effectively with the hard scientists we have here.” Facebook put unconscious-bias training front and center in its diversity efforts, too; both companies have posted online videos of their training modules, to offer a model for other workplaces. Since then, talk of unconscious bias has spread through Silicon Valley like—well, like a virus.\n\nOn a Thursday morning last summer, Joelle Emerson, the diversity consultant, visited a midsize start-up to give a talk on unconscious bias. Emerson knows employees don’t like being dragged to diversity-training sessions, so she strives to keep her presentations upbeat and funny and full of intriguing findings, much like a ted Talk. “We as individuals become smarter, better versions of ourselves when we are working on teams that are diverse,” she told the audience, pointing out that when you’re in a meeting with people who don’t share your background or demographic profile, you sit up a little straighter, intellectually. Expecting more pushback, you become more persuasive. “Our brains just function a little bit differently; we’re more vigilant, we’re more careful,” she said, citing a study that found diverse juries demonstrate better recall of courtroom proceedings. Her talk then segued—as many training sessions do—into what’s known as an implicit-association test.\n\nAn implicit-association test is a popular way to demonstrate how unconscious bias works. It was pioneered by Anthony G. Greenwald, a psychology professor at the University of Washington, in 1995. The idea is to have people very quickly sort words and concepts, revealing the implicit, or hidden, associations their brains make and the stereotypes that underlie them.\n\nEmerson started by having everybody practice raising his or her right hand and saying “right,” then raising his or her left hand and saying “left.” “I know it feels condescending that I make you practice, but the goal here is to be as quick as you can,” she said winningly. The audience obeyed, and there was clapping and laughter.\n\nThen she gave the test, flashing a series of words on a screen and having the audience members raise their left hand if the word referred to a male— son , say, or uncle —and their right if it referred to a female. She then flashed words pertaining to science (right hand) or liberal arts (left hand). Next she upped the ante: They had to raise their right hand if the word pertained to a male or to science, and their left hand if it was female- or liberal-arts-related. The audience accomplished this without much trouble. But then came the revelatory moment. “This time we’re going to swap the categories,” Emerson said, instructing the group to raise their left hand if a word was male- or liberal-arts-oriented, and their right hand for a female- or science-leaning term. A series of words flashed on the screen— chemistry , history , sister , son , English , grandpa , math , girl , physics , niece , boy —and the room devolved into chaos and chagrined laughter: People’s brains just wouldn’t go there. They couldn’t keep up.\n\nEmerson explained that regardless of what order the tasks are presented in, about three-quarters of the people who take the test are slower to respond when asked to link women with science and men with liberal arts. She talked about her own first time taking a version of the test, but with the categories of family and work. “I thought, I’m going to nail this ,” she said, but confessed that even with a working mother, a career, and years of immersion in gender research, she had a tendency to associate women with family and men with work. Unconscious bias, revealed.\n\nThe idea that everyone holds biases and that there is nothing wrong with having them is a core tenet of the training. Presenters often point out that bias and stereotyping are a natural, evolutionary defense, a mechanism that goes back to our early human roots: When primitive man saw a snake, he didn’t have time to determine whether it was poisonous or harmless; his brain said Snake! and he reacted. Our brains today take in more than 11 million pieces of information at any given moment; because we can process only about 40 of those consciously, our nonconscious mind takes over, using biases and stereotypes and patterns to filter out the noise.\n\nThe message of these sessions is that snap judgments are usually biased. This is a problem in a field like tech, where hiring managers may have to fill hundreds of positions. Too many decisions are made on gut instinct, the training argues: A time-pressed hiring manager looks at a résumé and sees a certain fraternity or hobby, or a conventionally white or male name, and bang —thanks to the unconscious brain making shortcuts, that person gets an interview. People listen respectfully to that person, while others—women, people of color—are interrupted and scrutinized.\n\nShelley Correll, the faculty director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford, gave her first unconscious-bias talk, at Cornell University, in 2003, when, she says, the topic was mostly of interest to academic departments. Now, she says, demand has spiked as tech companies have adopted the training. “Virtually every company I know of is deploying unconscious-bias training,” says Telle Whitney of the Anita Borg Institute. “It’s a fast and feel-good kind of training that helps you feel like you’re making a difference.”\n\nBut there’s a problem. Unconscious-bias training may not work. Some think it could even backfire. Though the approach is much more congenial than the “sensitivity training” popular in the 1980s and ’90s—in which white men were usually cast as villains—it suffers from the same problem: People resent being made to sit in a chair and listen to somebody telling them how to act. Forcing them to do so can provoke the fundamental human urge to reply: No thanks, I’ll do the opposite.\n\nWorse, repeatedly saying “I am biased and so are you” can make bias seem inescapable, even okay. People feel more accepting of their own bias, or throw their hands up, figuring that nothing can be done.\n\nThey may even become more biased. A 2015 study by Michelle M. Duguid of Cornell University and Melissa C. Thomas-Hunt of the University of Virginia demonstrates the peril of normalizing bad behavior. Stigmatizing certain behaviors, such as littering and alcohol abuse, makes people realize they are acting outside the norm and has proved to be a powerful way of changing these behaviors. Conversely, messages presenting good behavior as a social norm—“the majority of guests reuse their towels”—can make people embrace this behavior.\n\nSo what happens when you say that bias is natural and dwells within all of us? Duguid and Thomas-Hunt found that telling participants that many people hold stereotypes made them more likely to exhibit bias—in the case of the study, against women, overweight people, or the elderly. The researchers also suggest, provocatively, that even just talking too much about gender inequities can serve to normalize them: When you say over and over that women come up against a glass ceiling, people begin to accept that, yes, women come up against a glass ceiling—and that’s just the way it is.\n\nI talked about all these issues with Maxine Williams, the global director of diversity at Facebook, who conducts part of the company’s online training module. Williams is originally from Trinidad and Tobago; in the module, she mentions a study that found that dark-skinned people of color are seen by white job interviewers as less smart than light-skinned people of color. She told me she finds such studies hard to talk about, and had to force herself to do so.\n\nAt Facebook, she says, “managing bias” sessions are “suggested,” not mandated, which she hopes cuts down on any resentment. The goal is to create a culture where, even if you opt out of training, you can’t avoid the lessons, because managers come around talking about bias, and people are encouraged to call out colleagues in meetings when, say, they interrupt someone. “Have you interrupted an interrupter recently?,” Williams likes to ask audiences. She believes that talking about the pervasiveness of bias serves to disabuse people of the meritocracy fallacy.\n\nShe also told me that if you are going to be serious about bias training, you have to create a workplace where people feel safe giving voice to their own biases—where they can admit to thinking that men are better at math, for instance, or that new moms are less committed to their work—a perilous task, she acknowledges. “Once you start going down that road and saying to people, ‘Be open!,’ all sorts of things are going to come out,” Williams said. “We’re going to have to go through this mud together. It means you have to be forgiving as well.” She added that it’s necessary to assume that people, no matter what bias they are confessing, are well intentioned. “Presuming good intent” is crucial.\n\nWhen I mentioned this conversation to Bethanye Blount, who is a former Facebook employee (and thinks it’s a great place to work), she laughed at the “presuming good intent” part. “They’re catering to the engineers,” Blount said—engineers constituting a coveted and often sensitive cohort who like to think of themselves as “special snowflakes” and whom Facebook is smart to handle with care. One of the unspoken advantages of unconscious-bias training is that in an environment where companies are competing for talent, it promises to help attract talented women without scaring away talented men.\n\nI also talked with Bo Ren, a former Facebook employee who’s now a product manager at Tumblr. Ren said the atmosphere at Facebook was tranquil and feel-good on the surface, but—as in all workplaces—there were power dynamics underneath. To succeed anywhere in Silicon Valley, she said, you need to have social credibility, to be able to bring people around to your point of view and get them on board with a new product or solution—to be able to “socialize” your ideas. “You would think all things are equal,” she said, “but these backdoor conversations are happening in settings that women are not invited to. The whole boys’-club thing still applies. If you party with the right people at Burning Man, you’re going to be part of this boys’ club.” As for calling people out in meetings, it sounds like a good idea, she said, but she never saw anyone do it. “It’s just—are you really going to be that person?”\n\nOf late, the problems with unconscious-bias training have become more widely known. None other than Anthony Greenwald, the inventor of the implicit-association test, has expressed his doubts. “Understanding implicit bias does not actually provide you with the tools to do something about it,” he told Forbes . Kara Swisher, a co-founder of Recode , has said that talk about unconscious-bias training is “exhausting to listen to,” and an excuse for not trying hard enough. One tech executive, Mike Eynon, wrote in a Medium post that bias training makes “us white guys feel better” and lets the “privileged realize everyone has bias and they aren’t at fault,” while nothing changes for discriminated groups.\n\nIn 2016, Google reported incremental improvements: 31 percent of its overall workforce is now female, up one percentage point over the previous year. Nineteen percent of technical roles are held by women, also up a percentage point. At Facebook, women’s overall representation went up from 32 percent to 33 percent. In technical roles, women’s representation also increased a single percentage point, from 16 percent to 17 percent.\n\nTelle Whitney points out that for a large workforce like Google’s, a one-percentage-point rise is not peanuts. But while the companies’ commitment seems genuine, the slow pace of change underscores how far they have to go. If they want to truly transform, they may need to take more-drastic measures.\n\nA wealth of apps and software platforms now exists to circumvent unconscious bias. Here are a few of the offerings:\n\nTextio uses data and machine learning to scan job postings and flag phrases that are likely to repel women. Some are obvious: rock star, Ping-Pong, Nerf gun. But Kieran Snyder, Textio’s co-founder, says that other words can exhibit a subtler masculine bias. Examples include language that is what she calls “turned all the way up”: phrases like hard-driving and crush it as well as superlatives like flawless, relentless, and extremely. The software suggests gender-neutral alternatives.\n\nGapJumpers hides résumés and other identifying information, including gender, until job applicants perform a test devised to assess their skills. It’s an attempt to duplicate one of the most renowned studies in the gender-bias genre: In 2000, Claudia Goldin and Cecilia Rouse showed that when major U.S. orchestras allowed musicians to audition behind a screen that hid their gender, the percentage of women selected rose dramatically. They demonstrated that when people are assessed on pure ability, women are much more likely to make the cut.\n\nBlendoor is “Tinder for recruiting,” as its founder, Stephanie Lampkin, calls it. The app lets job candidates and recruiters check each other out: Candidates can see how a company rates on diversity; recruiters can see a person’s skills, education, and work history, but not his or her race, age, and gender.\n\nInterviewing.io offers a free platform that lets engineers do mock technical interviews, giving women (and anyone else who might feel out of place) a chance to practice. It also has software that companies can use to mask applicants’ voices during actual interviews.\n\nUnitive is based on the philosophy of “nudges,” or small changes that have a big effect. It guides managers through the hiring process, finding ways to prevent them from acting on bias. Names and gender are masked during résumé evaluation, for instance, and during interviews the software guides the managers through questions designed to evaluate relevant skills.\n\nLately, a new fix has emerged. Trying to change people’s unconscious attitudes is messy and complicated. But if you can’t easily dispel bias, what you can do is engineer a set of structural changes that prevent people from acting on it. Joelle Emerson talks about this a lot in her presentations, and works with companies to embed the insights of anti-bias training into hiring and promotion processes. One way to head off bias in hiring is to make sure that the job interviewer writes down a defined skill set beforehand, asks every applicant the same questions, and assesses the quality of answers according to a rubric, rather than simply saying, after the fact, “I really liked that person who went to the same school I did and likes ice hockey just as much as I do.”\n\nGoogle has been a proponent of such changes. In his 2015 book, Work Rules! , Laszlo Bock, who was the company’s senior vice president of people operations until last summer, cited a study from the University of Toledo that found that the first 20 seconds often predict the outcome of a 20-minute interview. The problem, he wrote, is that such quick impressions are meaningless. He added that Google strongly encourages interviewers to use a combination of skill assessments and standard questions rather than relying on subjective impressions.\n\nOther experts say that what companies need is an anti-bias checklist. The idea is spreading—Pinterest, for one, has worked with Emerson to develop a six-point checklist that includes measures such as reserving plenty of time for evaluating an employee’s performance, to counteract cognitive shortcuts that can introduce bias. But it’s early days: At Emerson’s talk on unconscious bias last summer, someone in the audience asked her which Silicon Valley companies are managing bias well. “No one,” she said, “because the idea of embedding it into organizational design is pretty new.”\n\nThis being Silicon Valley, new companies have already cropped up to digitize the checklist idea, offering tech solutions to tech’s gender problem: software that masks an applicant’s gender, or that guides hiring managers through a more objective evaluation process. (See the “ Anti-Bias Apps ” sidebar above.)\n\nEven when they work, however, these bias interventions get you only so far. Diversity consultants and advocacy groups say they remain frustrated by tech companies’ unwillingness to change core parts of their culture. It is, for example, a hallowed tradition that in job interviews, engineers are expected to stand up and code on whiteboards, a high-pressure situation that works to the disadvantage of those who feel out of place. Indeed, whiteboard sessions are rife with opportunities for biased judgment. At Stanford, Shelley Correll works with a graduate student who, for his dissertation, sat in on a whiteboarding session in which a problem had an error in it; when one female job candidate sensed this and kept asking questions, evaluators felt that all her questions suggested she wasn’t competent.\n\n“Until we see changes in the way we work, I don’t think we’re going to crack this nut,” Correll says. “I worked with one company that insisted that the best way for good ideas to emerge was to have people on teams screaming their ideas at each other. When you watch these teams work, they literally scream at each other and call each other names. They believe this dynamic is essential to scientific discovery—absolutely essential. I said, ‘Could you at least say you disagree with someone without saying you think they are an idiot?’ ”\n\nThere’s a term for the screaming-and-name-calling approach to scientific discovery. It’s called “constructive confrontation,” and it was pioneered by the company that helped give Silicon Valley its name. That would be Intel, maker of the silicon chip. Intel came into existence in a postwar America in which corporate offices were male as far as the eye could see. It and other early tech companies “were founded exclusively by men, and for better or worse they just had a male sensibility,” says Telle Whitney. As the former Intel CEO Andrew Grove put it in his book Only the Paranoid Survive : “From all the early bickering, we developed a style of ferociously arguing with one another while still remaining friends.”\n\nNow, of course, the talk is of inclusion, not confrontation. And I was surprised to hear Intel—old-fashioned Intel—mentioned as one of the companies successfully innovating around gender. It had been releasing diversity numbers since 2000, though not with as much fanfare as some of its peers, and without much improvement. But in the past couple of years, Intel decided to try a few other approaches, including hiring quotas.\n\nWell, not quotas. You can’t say quotas. At least not in the United States. In some European countries, like Norway, real, actual quotas—for example, a rule saying that 40 percent of a public company’s board members must be female—have worked well; qualified women have been found and the Earth has continued turning. However, in the U.S., hiring quotas are illegal. “We never use the word quota at Intel,” says Danielle Brown, the company’s chief diversity and inclusion officer. Rather, Intel set extremely firm hiring goals. For 2015, it wanted 40 percent of hires to be female or underrepresented minorities.\n\nNow, it’s true that lots of companies have hiring goals. But to make its goals a little more, well, quota-like, Intel introduced money into the equation. In Intel’s annual performance-bonus plan, success in meeting diversity goals factors into whether the company gives employees an across-the-board bonus. (The amounts vary widely but can be substantial.) If diversity efforts succeed, everybody at the company gets a little bit richer.\n\nGranted, Intel has further to go than some other companies, in part because most of its workforce is technical, unlike newer social-media companies. And with about 100,000 employees worldwide and decades of entrenched culture, it’s a slow and hulking ship to turn around.\n\nBut since it began linking bonuses to diversity hiring, Intel has met or exceeded its goals. In 2015, 43 percent of new hires were women and underrepresented minorities, three percentage points above its target. Last year, it upped its goal to 45 percent of new hires, and met it. These changes weren’t just happening at the entry level: 40 percent of new vice presidents were women and underrepresented minorities. Intel’s U.S. workforce in 2014 was just 23.5 percent female. By the middle of last year, the percentage had risen two points, to 25.4 percent.\n\nIntel has also introduced efforts to improve retention, including a “warm line” employees can use to report a problem—feeling stuck in their career, or a conflict with a manager—and have someone look into it. A new initiative will take data from the warm line and from employee exit interviews to give managers customized playbooks. If a group is losing lots of women, for instance, the manager will get data on why they’re leaving and how to address the issue.\n\nIntel isn’t perfect—its $300 million pledge for diversity efforts was seen by some as an effort to rehabilitate its image after the company got caught up in Gamergate, a complex scandal involving much gender-related ugliness. And women who have worked there say Intel’s not immune to the sexism that plagues the industry. But I was struck by how many people talk about the company’s genuine commitment.\n\nElizabeth Land, who worked at Intel for 18 years before leaving in 2015, says the hiring goals did foster some resentment among men. Still, she wishes more companies would adopt a similar approach, to force hiring managers to look beyond their immediate networks. “If you’re willing to spend the effort and the time to find the right senior-level females, you can.”\n\nShelley Correll agrees. “Tying bonuses to diversity outcomes signals that diversity is something the company cares about and thinks is important,” she says. “Managers will take it seriously.” In fact, she points out, the idea has history: PepsiCo did something similar starting in the early 2000s. When, in the second year, the company didn’t meet its goal of 50 percent diversity hires, executive bonuses suffered. But eventually the company’s workforce did become more diverse. From 2001 to 2006, the representation of women and minorities among executives increased from 34 percent to 45 percent.\n\nThere are other reasons for hope: Venture-capital firms have formed specifically to invest in start-ups run by women, and certain colleges—notably Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and Harvey Mudd—have dramatically increased the number of female students in their computer-science programs.\n\nPerhaps most encouraging is that as new companies come along, some of them are preemptively adopting the lessons that places like Intel and Google have already learned. Among these is Slack, the group-messaging company, which is widely praised for having made diversity a priority from early on, rather than having to go back and try to reengineer it in. Last year, when Slack received the TechCrunch award for Fastest Rising Startup, the company sent four black female software engineers—rather than the CEO, Stewart Butterfield (who’s white)—onstage to accept the award. “We’re engineers,” one of the women, Kiné Camara, said, meaningfully. From September 2015 to February 2016, as Slack grew, its technical workforce went from 18 percent to 24 percent female.

Horrific Things Come To Seem Normal ❧ Current Affairs","link":"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/07/how-horrific-things-come-to-seem-normal","content":"How Horrific Things Come To Seem Normal\n\nHow Horrific Things Come To Seem Normal\n\nCoverage of Hitler’s rise gives moral lessons for our time…\n\nThe first mention of Adolf Hitler in the New York Times was on November 21, 1922, buried on page 21. From the headline, one could almost have thought the article was about a cabaret singer or literary celebrity: “NEW POPULAR IDOL RISES IN BAVARIA.” It was not until the fifth sub-headline that the Times mentioned that Bavaria’s new pop idol, in addition to raising a “gray-shirted army armed with blackjacks and revolvers,” was “anti-Red and anti-Semitic.” In the body of the article, the Times correspondent frankly portrayed Hitler’s militarism, acknowledging the tendency of his group to “beat up protesting Socialists and Communists.” But, it said, there are multiple perspectives on Hitler: “[He] is taken seriously by all classes of Bavarians… he is feared by some, enthusiastically hailed as a prophet and political economic savior by others, and watched with interest by the bulk.” Most of the article was spent documenting Hitler’s gifts as a political organizer, noting that “in addition to his oratorical and organizing abilities, has another positive asset: he is a man of the ‘common people,’” who had won the Iron Cross, which for “a common soldier is distinctive evidence of bravery and daring,” and “he is credibly credited with being actuated by lofty, unselfish patriotism.”\n\nThe Times did not dwell too much on Hitler’s agenda, because “Hitler’s program is of less interest than his person and movement,” commenting that he promotes “half a dozen negative ideas clothed in generalities.” Toward the very end, the NYT did make clear that primary among these negative generalities was a murderous loathing of Jews. But, the correspondent said, this was probably just bluster:\n\nThe keynote of his speaking and writing is violent anti-Semitism… so violent are Hitler’s fulminations against Jews that a number of prominent Jewish citizens are said to have sought safe asylum in the Bavarian highlands… But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler’s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitism as a bait to catch followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line… A sophisticated political observer credited Hitler with peculiar cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying: “You can’t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you are leading them.”\n\nReading the New York Times’ coverage of the rise of Adolf Hitler and the progress of the Holocaust is a useful and sobering exercise. If you want to understand how atrocities can be normalized, ignored, and downplayed, and how anyone could “not know” facts that should have been obvious to everyone even at the time, browsing through the NYT archives can help. The Times was not the British Daily Mail (which was openly pro-fascist ). It was then, as it is now, a liberal paper, owned by a Jewish family. But, partly because liberal naivete about political reality made it harder to perceive threats that socialists and communists saw all too well, and partly because the Times’ owners didn’t want to be seen as being somehow biased toward Jews , the Times was timid about accurately portraying the Nazi menace.\n\nThe failure of the Times to report on the Holocaust itself has been widely documented, and is the subject of an entire book, Buried by the Times . The Times reviewer of that book admitted that the paper “was seriously negligent throughout that period,” burying stories about the killings of Jews in the back pages and never giving them space or significance proportionate to their moral importance. The reviewer, however, also partly defended the paper, pointing out that (1) it was not alone in doing this and (2) it could not have known what was going on, because what happened was unprecedented:\n\n[Buried by the Times’ worst failing is] its handling of exactly what people knew and understood in the 1930’s and 40’s as the Nazis drove Jews to their deaths. Concentration camps were nothing new; they’d been around throughout history. Death camps — the Nazis’ contribution to modernity — were unheard of, and the extent of the killing could not have been fathomed… How could Sulzberger or any other newspaper executive have comprehended the extent of what was happening in Europe?\n\nThat argument is highly plausible, and is often invoked when people or institutions are rebuked for their failures: It’s easy to say now that you should have known, but at the time… The phrase “Monday Morning Quarterback” and the word “ahistorical” are sometimes used. But this argument is not self-proving. It’s reasonable to think it might have been impossible to know. The question is whether it actually was. One reason to doubt it is that the New York Times actually did report on all of the facts that its reviewer said were impossible to comprehend. It just treated them as insignificant.\n\nFor instance, the first time the name “Auschwitz” was mentioned in the paper was on July 3, 1944, in a story entitled “Inquiry Confirms Nazi Death Camps: 1,715,000 Jews Said To Have Been Put To Death By Germans.” The story reported that international organizations had “confirmed reports of the existence in Auschwitz and Birkenau in upper Silesia of two ‘extermination camps’” where “Jews are shipped” to be “eradicated.” Front page news, one would hope? More like “midway down page 3.” The front page headlines that day:\n\nMAYOR WOULD TAX ALL RENTS TO END SUBWAY DEFICITS\n\nSimple Money Order Will Be Issued Soon\n\nOPA RAISES PRICES ON COTTON ITEMS, THIRD OF OUTPUT\n\nAnd the big story of the day:\n\nALL RAIL LINES TO MINSK NOW CUT\n\nThe Times had reported on the unfolding Holocaust well before 1944. In November of 1942, the paper published a story with the headline “HIMMLER PROGRAM KILLS POLISH JEWS: Slaughter of 250,000 In Plan To Wipe Out Half of Country This Year Is Reported.” Every fact was reported: “Old persons, children, infants, and cripples among the Jewish population of Poland are being shot, killed by various other methods, or forced to undergo hardships that inevitably cause death… Only 40,000 October ration cards had been printed for the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, where the population last march was 433,000….[The Poland plan is] ‘the first step toward complete liquidation.’… Only the young and relatively strong people are left alive as they provide valuable slave labor.’”\n\nThis report, in which every horror of the Holocaust was laid out for the world to witness, was so important that it made it to page 10. The front page that day was devoted to: the Battle of Stalingrad (important, admittedly!), “EXTORTION CHARGED BY MAYOR IN ROW OVER STIRRUP PUMPS,” “TWO THANKSGIVINGS FOR PACIFIC TROOPS,” and “PRESIDENT WARNS PRODUCTION CHIEFS TO RECONCILE AIMS.” ( Out of 23,000 front-page stories between 1939 and 1945, 11,500 were about World War II itself but only 26 were about the Holocaust.) This means that even in 2005, the New York Times was printing fabricated Holocaust history, suggesting that its writers and editors didn’t know about extermination camps, when the obvious truth is that they didn’t care.\n\nThat may be hard to accept: It couldn’t possibly be true that decent American liberals, or the Jewish owners of a major newspaper, could look at the plain facts of the Holocaust and think a mayoral row over stirrup pumps was more newsworthy. But it’s important to acknowledge that this was the case, and to try to makes sense of it and understand why. If we think that the media’s failure during the Holocaust was a failure to “follow the threads and assemble the big picture,” there’s not much to explain: As an unprecedented crime unfolds, we can only cast limited blame on journalists who weren’t quick enough or savvy enough to sift through the lies and find the truth. If, on the other hand, the news was blaring from the pages of the newspaper, we have evidence of something far more disquieting: the possibility for ordinary Americans to passively stand by and watch the slaughter of millions of innocent people. (The Holocaust is not the only example of this kind of after-the-fact obfuscation of the state of knowledge. In my book Superpredator , I show how Bill Clinton has twisted the facts of the Rwandan Genocide, insisting that his administration was unaware of the scale of what was happening, when the facts of the genocide were actually being reported in major newspapers as they occurred. Once again, it’s so hard to admit that one could be indifferent to something like this that one has to insist one wasn’t aware.)\n\nHow does one simply glance past the slaughter of millions? It’s easy: Overlooking the suffering of others is our default setting. People are abused, tormented, and oppressed every day, and while many of us like to think we’d intervene if a crime were occurring before our eyes, when it’s occurring far away, we have an impressive capacity to put it out of mind. The more different and distant other people are from ourselves, the more difficult it is to stimulate empathy for their pain. During the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Americans were far more moved by the suffering inflicted on their own soldiers than Vietnamese and Iraqi families; the Vietnam War Memorial does not list the name of Vietnamese individuals, after all, even though millions of them died as the result of our war. That may seem to make sense, but it only makes sense because of nationalism, and the belief that it’s natural and acceptable to care more about “our” people than theirs. (For more on American indifference to Vietnamese suffering, see my article on the Vietnam War in Issue 12 of Current Affairs.) My colleague Brianna Rennix and I have written about how little attention the American media pays to horrific violence in Mexico, because Mexican lives simply do not matter very much to Americans. You might be fine with that, but it’s an important part of the explanation for why the Holocaust became just another “poor foreigners being killed” story in the back of the paper.\n\nIf we go back to well before the beginning of the Holocaust, we can see what “not wanting to seem partial” did to coverage of the rise of Hitler. We’ve already seen the ridiculous article in which Hitler’s anti-Semitism was dismissed, with emphasis placed on his courage and patriotism instead. It’s important to note that in that article, the very first mention of Hitler in the paper, it was already very obvious that the “keynote” of Hitler’s speeches was his “violent” hatred of Jews, so violent that it was already causing Jewish Bavarians to flee to the hilltops in 1922. The fact that Hitler’s intentions were obvious and stated plainly from the beginning is worth keeping in mind. Another article from 1922 said that anti-Semitism had become “ rife all over Bavaria ” and that Hitler “parades primarily under the anti-Semitic banner.” Hitler’s “ fundamental principle ” is “anti-Semitism,” the paper reported in 1923. That makes it even more peculiar to read additional early coverage of Hitler that reads like this:\n\nThe new party demands that all Germans get together in a Pan-Germany on the basis of the right of self-determination of nations, the abolition of the treaties of Versailles and Saint Germain, colonies for feeding the German people, a sharp fight against the corrupting Parliamentary system, abolition of unemployment subsidies, State participations in the profits of big industries and enterprises, the creation of a healthy middle class, the death penalty for profiteers, the organization of a people’s army, the creation of a ‘German’ press, religious freedom and a fight against the Jewish-Materialistic spirit.\n\nSorry, what was that last thing again? (They did the same thing again in 1930.)\n\nOr, look at this small item from the Times, from Jan. 1923, which manages not to mention the “violent” and terrifying anti-Semitism that the paper had previously written about:\n\nPlenty of others from the early-to-mid-1920s are similar. They describe Hitler as the leader of the “Bavarian Fascisti” (at the time, still seen as an offshoot of Italian Fascism) but often mention the murderous hatred of Jews only in passing. A short article from 1924, after the Beer Hall Putsch, is called “Hitler Writes Book While In A Prison Cell,” and while it quotes an admirer promising that Hitler “will someday be reckoned among the greatest of his people,” and notes Hitler’s claim that he saved Germany from dictatorship, it says nothing about Hitler’s ideology other than that he “will soon be added to the list of political prisoners who have used their prison term to write books.” Another 1924 article, “Hitler’s Headquarters Are Described By Visitor,” is similarly focused on procedural aspects without interest in the ideological or programmatic substance. Many focus on issues we’d today call “horse race politics”: How are the fascists doing politically? Are they succeeding? Are they failing? Who are their central figures? What do people think of them? Those questions seem reasonable and important, but if they’re not paired with a strong moral sensibility, then one can lose sight of the actual human stakes of the political questions.\n\nAn absolutely astonishing profile of Hitler was published in the Times in 1930. Published on the very same day as an article about how the Nazis were bringing anti-Semitism back to German politics, the profile was so flattering and complimentary toward Hitler as to seem almost intentionally pro-Nazi. Anti-Semitism is mentioned only once, as the last among his “inchoate mixture of ideas” that it is “doubtful… anyone can make much sense out of.” But while the profile dismisses Hitler’s beliefs and program as being unworthy of inquiry, it does have much to say about Hitler the man:\n\nLike many other leaders of important political and social movements, Hitler is a man of the people, a carpenter by trade… Hitler is 41. He is of medium height, wiry, slender, with bristling toothbrush mustache, eyes spurting fire, straight nose, finely chiseled face, and a delicate complexion… His entire being breathes dynamic energy combined with a marked reserve. Four years in the trenches taught him to have no fear of death… It is to the young people… whose hearts and minds burn with a desire to play a part in the life of their country that Hitler and his oratory make their greatest appeal… The effect of Hitler’s eloquence and personality has been well described by a German who attended one of his early meetings in Munich. [The Times then quotes extensively from the flattering first-person account photographed above.]\n\nThis interest in the “personal” over the political would not even ebb after Kristallnacht, nor even in the weeks leading up to World War II: in August 1939, the Times published a profile of Hitler at home, entitled “ Herr Hitler, At Home In The Clouds ,” subtitle: “high up on his favorite mountain, he finds time for politics, solitude, and frequent official parties.” The “handsome” house “has seen many visitors of distinction,” and is “furnished harmoniously according to the best of German traditions,” with “beautiful common rooms, a large central hall,… and a long veranda with sliding class doors leading out onto the sheltered terrace.” We learn about Hitler’s preferred breakfast (“oatmeal porridge and prunes or wholemeal rye bread and honey”), his love of strolls through the mountains, his balance of work and leisure, and his habits with visitors:\n\nHitler sometimes takes a nap, or at any rate retires for a quiet hour of reading or thinking by himself. However, nap or no nap, the Fuhrer leaves his guests and everyday entourage to amuse themselves after their own fashion… [AFTER THIS THERE IS A LONG PART ABOUT HITLER’S TEA PAVILLION]… Hitler can be a good listener and seems to gather a good deal by letting American solo dancers or German film stars talk to him.\n\nThe Times was not alone in publishing stories about Hitler’s private life that declined to mention the “violent anti-Semitism” that was his “fundamental principle.” Life magazine and “even the American Kennel Club magazine [also] published lush, full-color spreads of Hitler’s domestic life.”\n\nA few notable tendencies recur in Times coverage of Hitler during the 1920s and ’30s. It’s not that the actual facts aren’t reported: Almost all of them are there, somewhere in the paper’s pages. It’s that the presentation and emphasis is strange. For example, when Kristallnacht occurred, it made the front page, but the headline was strange: “BERLIN RAIDS REPLY TO DEATH OF ENVOY.” The subheadline was “Nazis Loot Jews’ Shops, Burn City’s Biggest Synagogue To Avenge Paris Embassy Aide.” (“Reply” is a very odd word to choose.) Or look at the way the Times presented the news that 5,000 people had been imprisoned at Dachau in 1933: “Interned men have no complaint of treatment—those who ‘behave’ to be freed after a month.” The body text quoted, without skepticism, the Nazi claim that some prisoners “will be released on probation after a month.” Here, we see another press tendency that persists to this day: printing government claims as fact, even though we know from experience that governments constantly tell lies.\n\nThere’s a certain naivete that runs through all of the coverage. There’s 1923’s “Hitler Virtually Eliminated,” then the 1924 headline “ Hitler Tamed By Prison .” That article is about Hitler’s release back into the wild, and says that Hitler “looked a much sadder and wiser man today” as he left prison. Although he was “once the demi-god of the reactionary extremists,” authorities were “convinced he was no longer to be feared,” and the Times said of his future: “It is believed he will retire to private life and return to Austria.” In 1930, in an article that was literally about how the Nazis were open, unrepentant anti-Semites who were riding the issue to political success, the Times reporter nevertheless concluded “there is no present basis for assuming that the Nazis will attempt to make anti-Semitism a militant issue in their legislative program.” Here’s a final tragic bit of wishful thinking from his appointment as chancellor in 1933: “The composition of the cabinet leaves Herr Hitler no scope for the gratification of any dictatorial ambition.”\n\nWe can, of course, say that these stories only look ridiculous in hindsight, now that we know the course of history. But the threat Hitler posed to Jews was never hidden. It was in our papers, but people didn’t look, and didn’t protest when the United States government turned Jewish refugees back to face their fate. More importantly though is the “fool me once” element: The people who penned these newspaper articles, and the people who read them, are almost all dead. I am not interested in blaming them, or even criticizing the New York Times in particular. I’m interested in pointing out what the moral failures of a prior era can tell us about how we should act in our own time, and what our blind spots might be.\n\nFor me, the central lesson in reading the Times’ coverage is that it’s very easy not to notice that you’re overlooking something horrendous, that your biases and lack of curiosity are keeping you from appreciating things as they actually are. And because this is the case, we always have a duty to investigate the world closely in order to find out whether we may be just as delusional as people from prior eras. The New York Times did not fail to cover the Holocaust adequately because the Holocaust was so “unfathomable” that it was impossible to believe. They failed to cover it because they weren’t concerned enough about the lives of European Jews. Auschwitz was buried next to the classifieds, because the liquidation of millions of disenfranchised minorities in a far-off country was not something people cared about or wanted to hear about. That’s the same reason they could print articles about Hitler that didn’t mention his ideas: They didn’t really think much about his ideas, they were more interested in process than substance, because they didn’t work through the implications of what he was saying, or the potential consequences for other human beings.\n\nI don’t mean to analyze everything through the lens of the “left-liberal divide.” But the Socialists and Communists who protested Hitler in the early days and were beaten up by Brownshirts were under no illusions about what fascism was. And while you don’t need to be a socialist to see threats in the making, you do need to have a clear moral understanding of the world, and a willingness to label things what they are, rather than feigning objectivity and declining to use divisive and alienating language for fear you will look biased.\n\nWhen it comes again, as it very well might, it will not look exactly like it did before. There won’t necessarily be swastikas, and there probably won’t be any goose-stepping. The victims are not likely to be the same; we are now, thank God, sensitive to anti-Semitism and its risks. The question, then, is what we aren’t sensitive to. What won’t we notice until it’s too late? What could get worse and worse, without clearly registering in many people’s minds as an atrocity? Which groups receive the least empathy? In our time, I am especially concerned by the way that “legal status” is used as a proxy for “being a full human person,” since laws themselves are only as humane as the people who happen to be writing and enforcing them. Obsessing over “legality” is very dangerous; as one protest sign I saw pointed out, the people who hid Anne Frank were breaking the law, while the people who killed her were following it. I can envision a world in which “noncitizens” become nonpersons, and nobody notices what happens to nonpersons because nobody sympathizes with those who do not follow the law. If you didn’t want this to be done to you, you should have obeyed.\n\nWe are not in a time resembling 1920s Germany just yet. Hopefully, we will never be again. But if we ever are, a “never again” mentality means understanding how atrocities can be normalized, how moral blind spots can cause us to overlook terrible suffering, and how real objectivity does not just require a sense of superficial balance, but a deep understanding of what matters. The past is frozen in amber. We can’t go back and scream at those who were willfully blind to obvious crimes. But what we can do is try to look at our own era as we look at theirs, to think about what we’ll look like in retrospect, and to try to do what we wish those others would have done. And we can ask if future historians are looking at us across time, pleading with us and asking a question for which we have no good answer: Why didn’t you stop it before it started? Why did you wait until it was too late?\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider subscribing to our magnificent print edition or making a donation .

Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling by Ted Chiang — Subterranean

Subterranean Press Newsletter, Notes from the Underground:\n\nWhen my daughter Nicole was an infant, I read an essay suggesting that it might no longer be necessary to teach children how to read or write, because speech recognition and synthesis would soon render those abilities superfluous. My wife and I were horrified by the idea, and we resolved that, no matter how sophisticated technology became, our daughter’s skills would always rest on the bedrock of traditional literacy.\n\nIt turned out that we and the essayist were both half correct: now that she’s an adult, Nicole can read as well as I can. But there is a sense in which she has lost the ability to write. She doesn’t dictate her messages and ask a virtual secretary to read back to her what she last said, the way that essayist predicted; Nicole subvocalizes, her retinal projector displays the words in her field of vision, and she makes revisions using a combination of gestures and eye movements. For all practical purposes, she can write. But take away the assistive software and give her nothing but a keyboard like the one I remain faithful to, and she’d have difficulty spelling out many of the words in this very sentence. Under those specific circumstances, English becomes a bit like a second language to her, one that she can speak fluently but can only barely write.\n\nIt may sound like I’m disappointed in Nicole’s intellectual achievements, but that’s absolutely not the case. She’s smart and dedicated to her job at an art museum when she could be earning more money elsewhere, and I’ve always been proud of her accomplishments. But there is still the past me who would have been appalled to see his daughter lose her ability to spell, and I can’t deny that I am continuous with him.\n\nIt’s been more than twenty years since I read that essay, and in that period our lives have undergone countless changes that I couldn’t have predicted. The most catastrophic one was when Nicole’s mother Angela declared that she deserved a more interesting life than the one we were giving her, and spent the next decade criss-crossing the globe. But the changes leading to Nicole’s current form of literacy were more ordinary and gradual: a succession of software gadgets that not only promised but in fact delivered utility and convenience, and I didn’t object to any of them at the times of their introduction.\n\nSo it hasn’t been my habit to engage in doomsaying whenever a new product is announced; I’ve welcomed new technology as much as anyone. But when Whetstone released its new search tool Remem, it raised concerns for me in a way none of its predecessors did.\n\nMillions of people, some my age but most younger, have been keeping lifelogs for years, wearing personal cams that capture continuous video of their entire lives. People consult their lifelogs for a variety of reasons—everything from reliving favorite moments to tracking down the cause of allergic reactions—but only intermittently; no one wants to spend all their time formulating queries and sifting through the results. Lifelogs are the most complete photo album imaginable, but like most photo albums, they lie dormant except on special occasions. Now Whetstone aims to change all of that; they claim Remem’s algorithms can search the entire haystack by the time you’ve finished saying “needle.”\n\nRemem monitors your conversation for references to past events, and then displays video of that event in the lower left corner of your field of vision. If you say “remember dancing the conga at that wedding?”, Remem will bring up the video. If the person you’re talking to says “the last time we were at the beach,” Remem will bring up the video. And it’s not only for use when speaking with someone else; Remem also monitors your subvocalizations. If you read the words “the first Szechuan restaurant you ate at,” your vocal cords will move as if you’re reading aloud, and Remem will bring up the relevant video.\n\nThere’s no denying the usefulness of software that can actually answer the question “where did I put my keys?” But Whetstone is positioning Remem as more than a handy virtual assistant: they want it to take the place of your natural memory.\n\nIt was the summer of Jijingi’s thirteenth year when a European came to live in the village. The dusty harmattan winds had just begun blowing from the north when Sabe, the elder who was regarded as chief by all the local families, made the announcement.\n\nEveryone’s initial reaction was alarm, of course. “What have we done wrong?” Jijingi’s father asked Sabe.\n\nEuropeans had first come to Tivland many years ago, and while some elders said one day they’d leave and life would return to the ways of the past, until that day arrived it was necessary for the Tiv to get along with them. This had meant many changes in the way the Tiv did things, but it had never meant Europeans living among them before. The usual reason for Europeans to come to the village was to collect taxes for the roads they had built; they visited some clans more often because the people refused to pay taxes, but that hadn’t happened in the Shangev clan. Sabe and the other clan elders had agreed that paying the taxes was the best strategy.\n\nSabe told everyone not to worry. “This European is a missionary; that means all he does is pray. He has no authority to punish us, but our making him welcome will please the men in the administration.”\n\nHe ordered two huts built for the missionary, a sleeping hut and a reception hut. Over the course of the next several days everyone took time off from harvesting the guinea-corn to help lay bricks, sink posts into the ground, weave grass into thatch for the roof. It was during the final step, pounding the floor, that the missionary arrived. His porters appeared first, the boxes they carried visible from a distance as they threaded their way between the cassava fields; the missionary himself was the last to appear, apparently exhausted even though he carried nothing. His name was Moseby, and he thanked everyone who had worked on the huts. He tried to help, but it quickly became clear that he didn’t know how to do anything, so eventually he just sat in the shade of a locust bean tree and wiped his head with a piece of cloth.\n\nJijingi watched the missionary with curiosity. The man opened one of his boxes and took out what at first looked like a block of wood, but then he split it open and Jijingi realized it was a tightly bound sheaf of papers. Jijingi had seen paper before; when the Europeans collected taxes, they gave paper in return so that the village had proof of what they’d paid. But the paper that the missionary was looking at was obviously of a different sort, and must have had some other purpose.\n\nThe man noticed Jijingi looking at him, and invited him to come closer. “My name is Moseby,” he said. “What is your name?”\n\n“I am Jijingi, and my father is Orga of the Shangev clan.”\n\nMoseby spread open the sheaf of paper and gestured toward it. “Have you heard the story of Adam?” he asked. “Adam was the first man. We are all children of Adam.”\n\n“Here we are descendants of Shangev,” said Jijingi. “And everyone in Tivland is a descendant of Tiv.”\n\n“Yes, but your ancestor Tiv was descended from Adam, just as my ancestors were. We are all brothers. Do you understand?”\n\nThe missionary spoke as if his tongue were too large for his mouth, but Jijingi could tell what he was saying. “Yes, I understand.”\n\nMoseby smiled, and pointed at the paper. “This paper tells the story of Adam.”\n\n“It is an art that we Europeans know. When a man speaks, we make marks on the paper. When another man looks at the paper later, he sees the marks and knows what sounds the first man made. In that way the second man can hear what the first man said.”\n\nJijingi remembered something his father had told him about old Gbegba, who was the most skilled in bushcraft. “Where you or I would see nothing but some disturbed grass, he can see that a leopard had killed a cane rat at that spot and carried it off,” his father said. Gbegba was able to look at the ground and know what had happened even though he had not been present. This art of the Europeans must be similar: those who were skilled in interpreting the marks could hear a story even if they hadn’t been there when it was told.\n\n“Tell me the story that the paper tells,” he said.\n\nMoseby told him a story about Adam and his wife being tricked by a snake. Then he asked Jijingi, “How do you like it?”\n\n“You’re a poor storyteller, but the story was interesting enough.”\n\nMoseby laughed. “You are right, I am not good at the Tiv language. But this is a good story. It is the oldest story we have. It was first told long before your ancestor Tiv was born.”\n\nJijingi was dubious. “That paper can’t be so old.”\n\n“No, this paper is not. But the marks on it were copied from older paper. And those marks were copied from older paper. And so forth many times.”\n\nThat would be impressive, if true. Jijingi liked stories, and older stories were often the best. “How many stories do you have there?”\n\n“Very many.” Moseby flipped through the sheaf of papers, and Jijingi could see each sheet was covered with marks from edge to edge; there must be many, many stories there.\n\n“This art you spoke of, interpreting marks on paper; is it only for Europeans?”\n\n“No, I can teach it to you. Would you like that?”\n\nAs a journalist, I have long appreciated the usefulness of lifelogging for determining the facts of the matter. There is scarcely a legal proceeding, criminal or civil, that doesn’t make use of someone’s lifelog, and rightly so. When the public interest is involved, finding out what actually happened is important; justice is an essential part of the social contract, and you can’t have justice until you know the truth.\n\nHowever, I’ve been much more skeptical about the use of lifelogging in purely personal situations. When lifelogging first became popular, there were couples who thought they could use it to settle arguments over who had actually said what, using the video record to prove they were right. But finding the right clip of video often wasn’t easy, and all but the most determined gave up on doing so. The inconvenience acted as a barrier, limiting the searching of lifelogs to those situations in which effort was warranted, namely situations in which justice was the motivating factor.\n\nNow with Remem, finding the exact moment has become easy, and lifelogs that previously lay all but ignored are now being scrutinized as if they were crime scenes, thickly strewn with evidence for use in domestic squabbles.\n\nI typically write for the news section, but I’ve written feature stories as well, and so when I pitched an article about the potential downsides of Remem to my managing editor, he gave me the go-ahead. My first interview was with a married couple whom I’ll call Joel and Deirdre, an architect and a painter, respectively. It wasn’t hard to get them talking about Remem.\n\n“Joel is always saying that he knew it all along,” said Deirdre, “even when he didn’t. It used to drive me crazy, because I couldn’t get him to admit he used to believe something else. Now I can. For example, recently we were talking about the McKittridge kidnapping case.”\n\nShe sent me the video of one argument she had with Joel. My retinal projector displayed footage of a cocktail party; it’s from Deirdre’s point of view, and Joel is telling a number of people, “It was pretty clear that he was guilty from the day he was arrested.”\n\nDeirdre’s voice: “You didn’t always think that. For months you argued that he was innocent.”\n\nJoel shakes his head. “No, you’re misremembering. I said that even people who are obviously guilty deserve a fair trial.”\n\n“That’s not what you said. You said he was being railroaded.”\n\n“You’re thinking of someone else; that wasn’t me.”\n\n“No, it was you. Look.” A separate video window opened up, an excerpt of her lifelog that she looked up and broadcast to the people they’ve been talking with. Within the nested video, Joel and Deirdre are sitting in a café, and Joel is saying, “He’s a scapegoat. The police needed to reassure the public, so they arrested a convenient suspect. Now he’s done for.” Deidre replies, “You don’t think there’s any chance of him being acquitted?” and Joel answers, “Not unless he can afford a high-powered defense team, and I’ll bet you he can’t. People in his position will never get a fair trial.”\n\nI closed both windows, and Deirdre said, “Without Remem, I’d never be able to convince him that he changed his position. Now I have proof.”\n\n“Fine, you were right that time,” said Joel. “But you didn’t have to do that in front of our friends.”\n\n“You correct me in front of our friends all the time. You’re telling me I can’t do the same?”\n\nHere was the line at which the pursuit of truth ceased to be an intrinsic good. When the only persons affected have a personal relationship with each other, other priorities are often more important, and a forensic pursuit of the truth could be harmful. Did it really matter whose idea it was to take the vacation that turned out so disastrously? Did you need to know which partner was more forgetful about completing errands the other person asked of them? I was no expert on marriage, but I knew what marriage counselors said: pinpointing blame wasn’t the answer. Instead, couples needed to acknowledge each other’s feelings and address their problems as a team.\n\nNext I spoke with a spokesperson from Whetstone, Erica Meyers. For a while she gave me a typically corporate spiel about the benefits of Remem. “Making information more accessible is an intrinsic good,” she says. “Ubiquitous video has revolutionized law enforcement. Businesses become more effective when they adopt good record-keeping practices. The same thing happens to us as individuals when our memories become more accurate: we get better, not just at doing our jobs, but at living our lives.”\n\nWhen I asked her about couples like Joel and Deirdre, she said, “If your marriage is solid, Remem isn’t going to hurt it. But if you’re the type of person who’s constantly trying to prove that you’re right and your spouse is wrong, then your marriage is going to be in trouble whether you use Remem or not.”\n\nI conceded that she may have had a point in this particular case. But, I asked her, didn’t she think Remem created greater opportunities for those types of arguments to arise, even in solid marriages, by making it easier for people to keep score?\n\n“Not at all,” she said. “Remem didn’t give them a scorekeeping mentality; they developed that on their own. Another couple could just as easily use Remem to realize that they’ve both misremembered things, and become more forgiving when that sort of mistake happens. I predict the latter scenario will be the more common one with our customers as a whole.”\n\nI wished I could share Erica Meyers’ optimism, but I knew that new technology didn’t always bring out the best in people. Who hasn’t wished they could prove that their version of events was the correct one? I could easily see myself using Remem the way Deirdre did, and I wasn’t at all certain that doing so would be good for me. Anyone who has wasted hours surfing the internet knows that technology can encourage bad habits.\n\nMoseby gave a sermon every seven days, on the day devoted to resting and brewing and drinking beer. He seemed to disapprove of the beer drinking, but he didn’t want to speak on one of the days of work, so the day of beer brewing was the only one left. He talked about the European god, and told people that following his rules would improve their lives, but his explanations of how that would do so weren’t particularly persuasive.\n\nBut Moseby also had some skill at dispensing medicine, and he was willing to learn how to work in the fields, so gradually people grew more accepting of him, and Jijingi’s father let him visit Moseby occasionally to learn the art of writing. Moseby offered to teach the other children as well, and for a time Jijingi’s age-mates came along, mostly to prove to each other that they weren’t afraid of being near a European. Before long the other boys grew bored and left, but because Jijingi remained interested in writing and his father thought it would keep the Europeans happy, he was eventually permitted to go every day.\n\nMoseby explained to Jijingi how each sound a person spoke could be indicated with different marks on the paper. The marks were arranged in rows like plants in a field; you looked at the marks as if you were walking down a row, made the sound each mark indicated, and you would find yourself speaking what the original person had said. Moseby showed him how to make each of the different marks on a sheet of paper, using a tiny wooden rod that had a core of soot.\n\nIn a typical lesson, Moseby would speak, and then write what he had said: “When night comes I shall sleep.” Tugh mba a ile yo me yav. “There are two persons.” Ioruv mban mba uhar. Jijingi carefully copied the writing on his sheet of paper, and when he was done, Moseby would look at his paper.\n\n“Very good. But you need to leave spaces when you write.”\n\n“I have.” Jijingi pointed at the gap between each row.\n\n“No, that is not what I mean. Do you see the spaces within each line?” He pointed at his own paper.\n\nJijingi understood. “Your marks are clumped together, while mine are arranged evenly.”\n\n“These are not just clumps of marks. They are… I do not know what you call them.” He picked up a thin sheaf of paper from his table and flipped through it. “I do not see it here. Where I come from, we call them ‘words.’ When we write, we leave spaces between the words.”\n\n“How can I explain it?” He thought a moment. “If you speak slowly, you pause very briefly after each word. That’s why we leave a space in those places when we write. Like this: How. Many. Years. Old. Are. You?” He wrote on his paper as he spoke, leaving a space every time he paused: Anyom a ou kuma a me?\n\n“But you speak slowly because you’re a foreigner. I’m Tiv, so I don’t pause when I speak. Shouldn’t my writing be the same?”\n\n“It does not matter how fast you speak. Words are the same whether you speak quickly or slowly.”\n\n“Then why did you say you pause after each word?”\n\n“That is the easiest way to find them. Try saying this very slowly.” He pointed at what he’d just written.\n\nJijingi spoke very slowly, the way a man might when trying to hide his drunkenness. “Why is there no space in between an and yom ?”\n\n“ Anyom is one word. You do not pause in the middle of it.”\n\nMoseby sighed. “I will think more about how to explain what I mean. For now, just leave spaces in the places where I leave spaces.”\n\nWhat a strange art writing was. When sowing a field, it was best to have the seed yams spaced evenly; Jijingi’s father would have beaten him if he’d clumped the yams the way the Moseby clumped his marks on paper. But he had resolved to learn this art as best he could, and if that meant clumping his marks, he would do so.\n\nIt was only many lessons later that Jijingi finally understood where he should leave spaces, and what Moseby meant when he said “word.” You could not find the places where words began and ended by listening. The sounds a person made while speaking were as smooth and unbroken as the hide of a goat’s leg, but the words were like the bones underneath the meat, and the space between them was the joint where you’d cut if you wanted to separate it into pieces. By leaving spaces when he wrote, Moseby was making visible the bones in what he said.\n\nJijingi realized that, if he thought hard about it, he was now able to identify the words when people spoke in an ordinary conversation. The sounds that came from a person’s mouth hadn’t changed, but he understood them differently; he was aware of the pieces from which the whole was made. He himself had been speaking in words all along. He just hadn’t known it until now.\n\nThe ease of searching that Remem provides is impressive enough, but that merely scratches the surface of what Whetstone sees as the product’s potential. When Deirdre fact-checked her husband’s previous statements, she was posing explicit queries to Remem. But Whetstone expects that, as people become accustomed to their product, queries will take the place of ordinary acts of recall, and Remem will be integrated into their very thought processes. Once that happens, we will become cognitive cyborgs, effectively incapable of misremembering anything; digital video stored on error-corrected silicon will take over the role once filled by our fallible temporal lobes.\n\nWhat might it be like to have a perfect memory? Arguably the individual with the best memory ever documented was Solomon Shereshevskii, who lived in Russia during the first half of the twentieth century. The psychologists who tested him found that he could hear a series of words or numbers once and remember it months or even years later. With no knowledge of Italian, Shereshevskii was able to quote stanzas of The Divine Comedy that had been read to him fifteen years earlier.\n\nBut having a perfect memory wasn’t the blessing one might imagine it to be. Reading a passage of text evoked so many images in Shereshevskii’s mind that he often couldn’t focus on what it actually said, and his awareness of innumerable specific examples made it difficult for him to understand abstract concepts. At times, he tried to deliberately forget things. He wrote down numbers he no longer wanted to remember on slips of paper and then burnt them, a kind of slash-and-burn approach to clearing out the undergrowth of his mind, but to no avail.\n\nWhen I raised the possibility that a perfect memory might be a handicap to Whetstone’s spokesperson, Erica Meyers, she had a ready reply. “This is no different from the concerns people used to have about retinal projectors,” she said. “They worried that seeing updates constantly would be distracting or overwhelming, but we’ve all adapted to them.”\n\nI didn’t mention that not everyone considered that a positive development.\n\n“And Remem is entirely customizable,” she continued. “If at any time you find it’s doing too many searches for your needs, you can decrease its level of responsiveness. But according to our customer analytics, our users haven’t been doing that. As they become more comfortable with it, they’re finding that Remem becomes more helpful the more responsive it is.”\n\nBut even if Remem wasn’t constantly crowding your field of vision with unwanted imagery of the past, I wondered if there weren’t issues raised simply by having that imagery be perfect.\n\n“Forgive and forget” goes the expression, and for our idealized magnanimous selves, that was all you needed. But for our actual selves the relationship between those two actions wasn’t so straightforward. In most cases we had to forget a little bit before we could forgive; when we no longer experienced the pain as fresh, the insult was easier to forgive, which in turn made it less memorable, and so on. It was this psychological feedback loop that made initially infuriating offences seem pardonable in the mirror of hindsight.\n\nWhat I feared was that Remem would make it impossible for this feedback loop to get rolling. By fixing every detail of an insult in indelible video, it could prevent the softening that’s needed for forgiveness to begin. I thought back to what Erica Meyers said about Remem’s inability to hurt solid marriages. Implicit in that assertion was a claim about what qualified as a solid marriage. If someone’s marriage was built on—as ironic as it might sound—a cornerstone of forgetfulness, what right did Whetstone have to shatter that?\n\nThe issue wasn’t confined to marriages; all sorts of relationships rely on forgiving and forgetting. My daughter Nicole has always been strong-willed; rambunctious when she was a child, openly defiant as an adolescent. She and I had many furious arguments during her teen years, arguments that we have mostly been able to put behind us, and now our relationship is pretty good. If we’d had Remem, would we still be speaking to each other?\n\nI don’t mean to say that forgetting is the only way to mend relationships. While I can no longer recall most of the arguments Nicole and I had—and I’m grateful that I can’t—one of the arguments I remember clearly is one that spurred me to be a better father.\n\nIt was when Nicole was sixteen, a junior in high school. It had been two years since her mother Angela had left, probably the two hardest years of both our lives. I don’t remember what started the argument—something trivial, no doubt—but it escalated and before long Nicole was taking her anger at Angela out on me.\n\n“You’re the reason she left! You drove her away! You can leave too, for all I care. I sure as hell would be better off without you.” And to demonstrate her point, she stormed out of the house.\n\nI knew it wasn’t premeditated malice on her part—I don’t think she engaged in much premeditation in anything during that phase of her life—but she couldn’t have come up with a more hurtful accusation if she’d tried. I’d been devastated by Angela’s departure, and I was constantly wondering what I could have done differently to keep her.\n\nNicole didn’t come back until the next day, and that night was one of soul searching for me. While I didn’t believe I was responsible for her mother leaving us, Nicole’s accusation still served as a wake-up call. I hadn’t been conscious of it, but I realized that I had been thinking of myself as the greatest victim of Angela’s departure, wallowing in self-pity over just how unreasonable my situation was. It hadn’t even been my idea to have children; it was Angela who’d wanted to be a parent, and now she had left me holding the bag. What sane world would leave me with sole responsibility for raising an adolescent girl? How could a job that was so difficult be entrusted to someone with no experience whatsoever?\n\nNicole’s accusation made me realize her predicament was worse than mine. At least I had volunteered for this duty, albeit long ago and without full appreciation for what I was getting into. Nicole had been drafted into her role, with no say whatsoever. If there was anyone who had a right to be resentful, it was her. And while I thought I’d been doing a good job of being a father, obviously I needed to do better.\n\nI turned myself around. Our relationship didn’t improve overnight, but over the years I was able to work myself back into Nicole’s good graces. I remember the way she hugged me at her college graduation, and I realized my years of effort had paid off.\n\nWould those years of repair have been possible with Remem? Even if each of us could have refrained from throwing the other’s bad behavior in their faces, the opportunity to privately rewatch video of our arguments seems like it could be pernicious. Vivid reminders of the way she and I yelled at each other in the past might have kept our anger fresh, and prevented us from rebuilding our relationship.\n\nJijingi wanted to write down some of the stories of where the Tiv people came from, but the storytellers spoke rapidly, and he wasn’t able to write fast enough to keep up with them. Moseby said he would get better with practice, but Jijingi despaired that he’d ever become fast enough.\n\nThen, one summer a European woman named Reiss came to visit the village. Moseby said she was “a person who learns about other people” but could not explain what that meant, only that she wanted to learn about Tivland. She asked questions of everyone, not just the elders but young men, too, even women and children, and she wrote down everything they told her. She didn’t try to get anyone to adopt European practices; where Moseby had insisted that there were no such thing as curses and that everything was God’s will, Reiss asked about how curses worked, and listened attentively to explanations of how your kin on your father’s side could curse you while your kin on your mother’s side could protect you from curses.\n\nOne evening Kokwa, the best storyteller in the village, told the story of how the Tiv people split into different lineages, and Reiss had written it down exactly as he told it. Later she had recopied the story using a machine she poked at noisily with her fingers, so that she had a copy that was clean and easy to read. When Jijingi asked if she would make another copy for him, she agreed, much to his excitement.\n\nThe paper version of the story was curiously disappointing. Jijingi remembered that when he had first learned about writing, he’d imagined it would enable him to see a storytelling performance as vividly as if he were there. But writing didn’t do that. When Kokwa told the story, he didn’t merely use words; he used the sound of his voice, the movement of his hands, the light in his eyes. He told you the story with his whole body, and you understood it the same way. None of that was captured on paper; only the bare words could be written down. And reading just the words gave you only a hint of the experience of listening to Kokwa himself, as if one were licking the pot in which okra had been cooked instead of eating the okra itself.\n\nJijingi was still glad to have the paper version, and would read it from time to time. It was a good story, worthy of being recorded on paper. Not everything written on paper was so worthy. During his sermons Moseby would read aloud stories from his book, and they were often good stories, but he also read aloud words he had written down just a few days before, and those were often not stories at all, merely claims that learning more about the European god would improve the lives of the Tiv people.\n\nOne day, when Moseby had been eloquent, Jijingi complimented him. “I know you think highly of all your sermons, but today’s sermon was a good one.”\n\n“Thank you,” said Moseby, smiling. After a moment, he asked, “Why do you say I think highly of all my sermons?”\n\n“Because you expect that people will want to read them many years from now.”\n\n“I don’t expect that. What makes you think that?”\n\n“You write them all down before you even deliver them. Before even one person has heard a sermon, you have written it down for future generations.”\n\nMoseby laughed. “No, that is not why I write them down.”\n\n“Why, then?” He knew it wasn’t for people far away to read them, because sometimes messengers came to the village to deliver paper to Moseby, and he never sent his sermons back with them.\n\n“I write the words down so I do not forget what I want to say when I give the sermon.”\n\n“How could you forget what you want to say? You and I are speaking right now, and neither of us needs paper to do so.”\n\n“A sermon is different from conversation.” Moseby paused to consider. “I want to be sure I give my sermons as well as possible. I won’t forget what I want to say, but I might forget the best way to say it. If I write it down, I don’t have to worry. But writing the words down does more than help me remember. It helps me think.”\n\n“How does writing help you think?”\n\n“That is a good question,” he said. “It is strange, isn’t it? I do not know how to explain it, but writing helps me decide what I want to say. Where I come from, there’s a very old proverb: verba volant, scripta manent. In Tiv you would say, ‘spoken words fly away, written words remain.’ Does that make sense?”\n\n“Yes,” Jijingi said, just to be polite; it made no sense at all. The missionary wasn’t old enough to be senile, but his memory must be terrible and he didn’t want to admit it. Jijingi told his age-mates about this, and they joked about it amongst themselves for days. Whenever they exchanged gossip, they would add, “Will you remember that? This will help you,” and mimic Moseby writing at his table.\n\nOn an evening the following year, Kokwa announced he would tell the story of how the Tiv split into different lineages. Jijingi brought out the paper version he had, so he could read the story at the same time Kokwa told it. Sometimes he could follow along, but it was often confusing because Kokwa’s words didn’t match what was written on the paper. After Kokwa was finished, Jijingi said to him, “You didn’t tell the story the same way you told it last year.”\n\n“Nonsense,” said Kokwa. “When I tell a story it doesn’t change, no matter how much time passes. Ask me to tell it twenty years from today, and I will tell it exactly the same.”\n\nJijingi pointed at the paper he held. “This paper is the story you told last year, and there were many differences.” He picked one he remembered. “Last time you said, ‘the Uyengi captured the women and children and carried them off as slaves.’ This time you said, ‘they made slaves of the women, but they did not stop there: they even made slaves of the children.’”\n\n“It is the same story, but you’ve changed the way you tell it.”\n\n“No,” said Kokwa, “I told it just as I told it before.”\n\nJijingi didn’t want to try to explain what words were. Instead he said, “If you told it as you did before, you would say ‘the Uyengi captured the women and children and carried them off as slaves’ every time.”\n\nFor a moment Kokwa stared at him, and then he laughed. “Is this what you think is important, now that you’ve learned the art of writing?”\n\nSabe, who had been listening to them, chided Kokwa. “It’s not your place to judge Jijingi. The hare favors one food, the hippo favors another. Let each spend his time as he pleases.”\n\n“Of course, Sabe, of course,” said Kokwa, but he threw a derisive glance at Jijingi.\n\nAfterwards, Jijingi remembered the proverb Moseby had mentioned. Even though Kokwa was telling the same story, he might arrange the words differently each time he told it; he was skilled enough as a storyteller that the arrangement of words didn’t matter. It was different for Moseby, who never acted anything out when he gave his sermons; for him, the words were what was important. Jijingi realized that Moseby wrote down his sermons not because his memory was terrible, but because he was looking for a specific arrangement of words. Once he found the one he wanted, he could hold on to it for as long as he needed.\n\nOut of curiosity, Jijingi tried imagining he had to deliver a sermon, and began writing down what he would say. Seated on the root of a mango tree with the notebook Moseby had given him, he composed a sermon on tsav , the quality that enabled some men to have power over others, and a subject which Moseby hadn’t understood and had dismissed as foolishness. He read his first attempt to one of his age-mates, who pronounced it terrible, leading them to have a brief shoving match, but afterwards Jijingi had to admit his age-mate was right. He tried writing out his sermon a second time and then a third before he became tired of it and moved on to other topics.\n\nAs he practiced his writing, Jijingi came to understand what Moseby had meant; writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn’t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.\n\nPsychologists make a distinction between semantic memory—knowledge of general facts—and episodic memory—recollection of personal experiences. We’ve been using technological supplements for semantic memory ever since the invention of writing: first books, then search engines. By contrast, we’ve historically resisted such aids when it comes to episodic memory; few people have ever kept as many diaries or photo albums as they did ordinary books. The obvious reason is convenience; if we wanted a book on the birds of North America, we could consult one that an ornithologist has written, but if we wanted a daily diary, we had to write it for ourselves. But I also wonder if another reason is that, subconsciously, we regarded our episodic memories as such an integral part of our identities that we were reluctant to externalize them, to relegate them to books on a shelf or files on a computer.\n\nThat may be about to change. For years parents have been recording their children’s every moment, so even if children weren’t wearing personal cams, their lifelogs were effectively already being compiled. Now parents are having their children wear retinal projectors at younger and younger ages so they can reap the benefits of assistive software agents sooner. Imagine what will happen if children begin using Remem to access those lifelogs: their mode of cognition will diverge from ours because the act of recall will be different. Rather than thinking of an event from her past and seeing it with her mind’s eye, a child will subvocalize a reference to it and watch video footage with her physical eyes. Episodic memory will become entirely technologically mediated.\n\nAn obvious drawback to such reliance is the possibility that people might become virtual amnesiacs whenever the software crashes. But just as worrying to me as the prospect of technological failure was that of technological success: how will it change a person’s conception of herself when she’s only seen her past through the unblinking eye of a video camera? Just as there’s a feedback loop in softening harsh memories, there’s also one at work in the romanticization of childhood memories, and disrupting that process will have consequences.\n\nThe earliest birthday I remember is my fourth; I remember blowing out the candles on my cake, the thrill of tearing the wrapping paper off the presents. There’s no video of the event, but there are snapshots in the family album, and they are consistent with what I remember. In fact, I suspect I no longer remember the day itself. It’s more likely that I manufactured the memory when I was first shown the snapshots and over time, I’ve imbued it with the emotion I imagine I felt that day. Little by little, over repeated instances of recall, I’ve created a happy memory for myself.\n\nAnother of my earliest memories is of playing on the living room rug, pushing toy cars around, while my grandmother worked at her sewing machine; she would occasionally turn and smile warmly at me. There are no photos of that moment, so I know the recollection is mine and mine alone. It is a lovely, idyllic memory. Would I want to be presented with actual footage of that afternoon? No; absolutely not.\n\nRegarding the role of truth in autobiography, the critic Roy Pascal wrote, “On the one side are the truths of fact, on the other the truth of the writer’s feeling, and where the two coincide cannot be decided by any outside authority in advance.” Our memories are private autobiographies, and that afternoon with my grandmother features prominently in mine because of the feelings associated with it. What if video footage revealed that my grandmother’s smile was in fact perfunctory, that she was actually frustrated because her sewing wasn’t going well? What’s important to me about that memory is the happiness I associated with it, and I wouldn’t want that jeopardized.\n\nIt seemed to me that continuous video of my entire childhood would be full of facts but devoid of feeling, simply because cameras couldn’t capture the emotional dimension of events. As far as the camera was concerned, that afternoon with my grandmother would be indistinguishable from a hundred others. And if I’d grown up with access to all the video footage, there’d have been no way for me to assign more emotional weight to any particular day, no nucleus around which nostalgia could accrete.\n\nAnd what will the consequences be when people can claim to remember their infancy? I could readily imagine a situation where, if you ask a young person what her earliest memory is, she will simply look baffled; after all, she has video dating back to the day of her birth. The inability to remember the first few years of one’s life—what psychologists call childhood amnesia—might soon be a thing of the past. No more would parents tell their children anecdotes beginning with the words “You don’t remember this because you were just a toddler when it happened.” It’ll be as if childhood amnesia is a characteristic of humanity’s childhood, and in ouroboric fashion, our youth will vanish from our memories.\n\nPart of me wanted to stop this, to protect children’s ability to see the beginning of their lives filtered through gauze, to keep those origin stories from being replaced by cold, desaturated video. But maybe they will feel just as warmly about their lossless digital memories as I do of my imperfect, organic memories.\n\nPeople are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we’ve lived; they’re the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments. Which is why, even when we’ve experienced the same events as other individuals, we never constructed identical narratives: the criteria used for selecting moments were different for each of us, and a reflection of our personalities. Each of us noticed the details that caught our attention and remembered what was important to us, and the narratives we built shaped our personalities in turn.\n\nBut, I wondered, if everyone remembered everything, would our differences get shaved away? What would happen to our sense of selves? It seemed to me that a perfect memory couldn’t be a narrative any more than unedited security-cam footage could be a feature film.\n\nWhen Jijingi was twenty, an officer from the administration came to the village to speak with Sabe. He had brought with him a young Tiv man who had attended the mission school in Katsina-Ala. The administration wanted to have a written record of all the disputes brought before the tribal courts, so they were assigning each chief one of these youths to act as a scribe. Sabe had Jijingi come forward, and to the officer he said, “I know you don’t have enough scribes for all of Tivland. Jijingi here has learned to write; he can act as our scribe, and you can send your boy to another village.” The officer tested Jijingi’s ability to write, but Moseby had taught him well, and eventually the officer agreed to have him be Sabe’s scribe.\n\nAfter the officer had left, Jijingi asked Sabe why he hadn’t wanted the boy from Katsina-Ala to be his scribe.\n\n“No one who comes from the mission school can be trusted,” said Sabe.\n\n“Why not? Did the Europeans make them liars?”\n\n“They’re partly to blame, but so are we. When the Europeans collected boys for the mission school years ago, most elders gave them the ones they wanted to get rid of, the layabouts and malcontents. Now those boys have returned, and they feel no kinship with anyone. They wield their knowledge of writing like a long gun; they demand their chiefs find them wives, or else they’ll write lies about them and have the Europeans depose them.”\n\nJijingi knew a boy who was always complaining and looking for ways to avoid work; it would be a disaster if someone like him had power over Sabe. “Can’t you tell the Europeans about this?”\n\n“Many have,” Sabe answered. “It was Maisho of the Kwande clan who warned me about the scribes; they were installed in Kwande villages first. Maisho was fortunate that the Europeans believed him instead of his scribe’s lies, but he knows of other chiefs who were not so lucky; the Europeans often believe paper over people. I don’t wish to take the chance.” He looked at Jijingi seriously. “You are my kin, Jijingi, and kin to everyone in this village. I trust you to write down what I say.”\n\nTribal court was held every month, from morning until late afternoon for three days in a row, and it always attracted an audience, sometimes one so large that Sabe had to demand everyone sit to allow the breeze to reach the center of the circle. Jijingi sat next to Sabe and recorded the details of each dispute in a book the officer had left. It was a good job; he was paid out of the fees collected from the disputants, and he was given not just a chair but a small table too, which he could use for writing even when court wasn’t in session. The complaints Sabe heard were varied—one might be about a stolen bicycle, another might be about whether a man was responsible for his neighbor’s crops failing—but most had to do with wives. For one such dispute, Jijingi wrote down the following:\n\nUmem’s wife Girgi has run away from home and gone back to her kin. Her kinsman Anongo has tried to convince her to stay with her husband, but Girgi refuses, and there is no more Anongo can do. Umem demands the return of the £11 he paid as bridewealth. Anongo says he has no money at the moment, and moreover that he was only paid £6.\n\nSabe requested witnesses for both sides. Anongo says he has witnesses, but they have gone on a trip. Umem produces a witness, who is sworn in. He testifies that he himself counted the £11 that Umem paid to Anongo.\n\nSabe asks Girgi to return to her husband and be a good wife, but she says she has had all that she can stand of him. Sabe instructs Anongo to repay Umem £11, the first payment to be in three months when his crops are saleable. Anongo agrees.\n\nIt was the final dispute of the day, by which time Sabe was clearly tired. “Selling vegetables to pay back bridewealth,” he said afterwards, shaking his head. “This wouldn’t have happened when I was a boy.”\n\nJijingi knew what he meant. In the past, the elders said, you conducted exchanges with similar items: if you wanted a goat, you could trade chickens for it; if you wanted to marry a woman, you promised one of your kinswomen to her family. Then the Europeans said they would no longer accept vegetables as payment for taxes, insisting that it be paid in coin. Before long, everything could be exchanged for money; you could use it to buy everything from a calabash to a wife. The elders considered it absurd.\n\n“The old ways are vanishing,” agreed Jijingi. He didn’t say that young people preferred things this way, because the Europeans had also decreed that bridewealth could only be paid if the woman consented to the marriage. In the past, a young woman might be promised to an old man with leprous hands and rotting teeth, and have no choice but to marry him. Now a woman could marry the man she favored, as long as he could afford to pay the bridewealth. Jijingi himself was saving money to marry.\n\nMoseby came to watch sometimes, but he found the proceedings confusing, and often asked Jijingi questions afterwards.\n\n“For example, there was the dispute between Umem and Anongo over how much bridewealth was owed. Why was only the witness sworn in?” asked Moseby.\n\n“To ensure that he said precisely what happened.”\n\n“But if Umem and Anongo were sworn in, that would have ensured they said precisely what happened too. Anongo was able to lie because he was not sworn in.”\n\n“Anongo didn’t lie,” said Jijingi. “He said what he considered right, just as Umem did.”\n\n“But what Anongo said wasn’t the same as what the witness said.”\n\n“But that doesn’t mean he was lying.” Then Jijingi remembered something about the European language, and understood Moseby’s confusion. “Our language has two words for what in your language is called ‘true.’ There is what’s right, mimi , and what’s precise, vough . In a dispute the principals say what they consider right; they speak mimi . The witnesses, however, are sworn to say precisely what happened; they speak vough . When Sabe has heard what happened can he decide what action is mimi for everyone. But it’s not lying if the principals don’t speak vough , as long as they speak mimi .”\n\nMoseby clearly disapproved. “In the land I come from, everyone who testifies in court must swear to speak vough , even the principals.”\n\nJijingi didn’t see the point of that, but all he said was, “Every tribe has its own customs.”\n\n“Yes, customs may vary, but the truth is the truth; it doesn’t change from one person to another. And remember what the Bible says: the truth shall set you free.”\n\n“I remember,” said Jijingi. Moseby had said that it was knowing God’s truth that had made the Europeans so successful. There was no denying their wealth or power, but who knew what was the cause?\n\nIn order to write about Remem, it was only fair that I try it out myself. The problem was that I didn’t have a lifelog for it to index; typically I only activated my personal cam when I was conducting an interview or covering an event. But I’ve certainly spent time in the presence of people who kept lifelogs, and I could make use of what they’d recorded. While all lifelogging software has privacy controls in place, most people also grant basic sharing rights: if your actions were recorded in their lifelog, you have access to the footage in which you’re present. So I launched an agent to assemble a partial lifelog from the footage others had recorded, using my GPS history as the basis for the query. Over the course of a week, my request propagated through social networks and public video archives, and I was rewarded with snippets of video ranging from a few seconds in length to a few hours: not just security-cam footage but excerpts from the lifelogs of friends, acquaintances, and even complete strangers.\n\nThe resulting lifelog was of course highly fragmentary compared to what I would have had if I’d been recording video myself, and the footage was all from a third-person perspective rather than the first-person that most lifelogs have, but Remem was able to work with that. I expected that coverage would be thickest in the later years, simply due to the increasing popularity of lifelogs. It was somewhat to my surprise, then, that when I looked at a graph of the coverage, I found a bump in the coverage over a decade ago. Nicole had been keeping a lifelog since she was a teenager, so an unexpectedly large segment of my domestic life was present.\n\nI was initially a bit uncertain of how to test Remem, since I obviously couldn’t ask it to bring up video of an event I didn’t remember. I figured I’d start out with something I did remember. I subvocalized, “The time Vince told me about his trip to Palau.”\n\nMy retinal projector displayed a window in the lower left corner of my field of vision: I’m having lunch with my friends Vincent and Jeremy. Vincent didn’t maintain a lifelog either, so the footage was from Jeremy’s point of view. I listened to Vincent rave about scuba diving for a minute.\n\nNext I tried something that I only vaguely remembered. “The dinner banquet when I sat between Deborah and Lyle.” I didn’t remember who else was sitting at the table, and wondered if Remem could help me identify them.\n\nSure enough, Deborah had been recording that evening, and with her video I was able to use a recognition agent to identity everyone sitting across from us.\n\nAfter those initial successes, I had a run of failures; not surprising, considering the gaps in the lifelog. But over the course of an hour-long trip survey of past events, Remem’s performance was generally impressive.\n\nFinally it seemed time for me to try Remem on some memories that were more emotionally freighted. My relationship with Nicole felt strong enough now for me to safely revisit the fights we’d had when she was young. I figured I’d start with the argument I remembered clearly, and work backwards from there.\n\nI subvocalized, “The time Nicole yelled at me ‘you’re the reason she left.’”\n\nThe window displays the kitchen of the house we lived in when Nicole was growing up. The footage is from Nicole’s point of view, and I’m standing in front of the stove. It’s obvious we’re fighting.\n\n“You’re the reason she left. You can leave too, for all I care. I sure as hell would be better off without you.”\n\nThe words were just as I remembered them, but it wasn’t Nicole saying them.\n\nIt was me.\n\nMy first thought was that it must be a fake, that Nicole had edited the video to put her words into my mouth. She must have noticed my request for access to her lifelog footage, and concocted this to teach me a lesson. Or perhaps it was a film she had created to show her friends, to reinforce the stories she told about me. But why was she still so angry at me, that she would do such a thing? Hadn’t we gotten past this?\n\nI started skimming through the video, looking for inconsistencies that would indicate where the edited footage had been spliced in. The subsequent footage showed Nicole running out of the house, just as I remembered, so there wouldn’t be signs of inconsistency there. I rewound the video and started watching the preceding argument.\n\nInitially I was angry as I watched, angry at Nicole for going to such lengths to create this lie, because the preceding footage was all consistent with me being the one who yelled at her. Then some of what I was saying in the video began to sound queasily familiar: complaining about being called to her school again because she’d gotten into trouble, accusing her of spending time with the wrong crowd. But this wasn’t the context in which I’d said those things, was it? I had been voicing my concern, not berating her. Nicole must have adapted things I’d said elsewhere to make her slanderous video more plausible. That was the only explanation, right?\n\nI asked Remem to examine the video’s watermark, and it reported the video was unmodified. I saw that Remem had suggested a correction in my search terms: where I had said “the time Nicole yelled at me,” it offered “the time I yelled at Nicole.” The correction must have been displayed at the same time as the initial search result, but I hadn’t noticed. I shut down Remem in disgust, furious at the product. I was about to search for information on forging a digital watermark to prove this video was faked, but I stopped myself, recognizing it as an act of desperation.\n\nI would have testified, hand on a stack of Bibles or using any oath required of me, that it was Nicole who’d accused me of being the reason her mother left us. My recollection of that argument was as clear as any memory I had, but that wasn’t the only reason I found the video hard to believe; it was also my knowledge that—whatever my faults or imperfections—I was never the kind of father who could say such a thing to his child.\n\nYet here was digital video proving that I had been exactly that kind of father. And while I wasn’t that man anymore, I couldn’t deny that I was continuous with him.\n\nEven more telling was the fact that for many years I had successfully hidden the truth from myself. Earlier I said that the details we choose to remember are a reflection of our personalities. What did it say about me that I put those words in Nicole’s mouth instead of mine?\n\nI remembered that argument as being a turning point for me. I had imagined a narrative of redemption and self-improvement in which I was the heroic single father, rising to meet the challenge. But the reality was…what? How much of what had happened since then could I take credit for?\n\nI restarted Remem and began looking at video of Nicole’s graduation from college. That was an event I had recorded myself, so I had footage of Nicole’s face, and she seemed genuinely happy in my presence. Was she hiding her true feelings so well that I couldn’t detect them? Or, if our relationship had actually improved, how had that happened? I had obviously been a much worse father fourteen years ago than I’d thought; it would be tempting to conclude I had come farther to reach where I currently was, but I couldn’t trust my perceptions anymore. Did Nicole even have positive feelings about me now?\n\nI wasn’t going to try using Remem to answer this question; I needed to go to the source. I called Nicole and left a message saying I wanted to talk to her, and asking if I could come over to her apartment that evening.\n\nIt was a few years later that Sabe began attending a series of meetings of all the chiefs in the Shangev clan. He explained to Jijingi that the Europeans no longer wished to deal with so many chiefs, and were demanding that all of Tivland be divided into eight groups they called ‘septs.’ As a result, Sabe and the other chiefs had to discuss who the Shangev clan would join with. Although there was no need for a scribe, Jijingi was curious to hear the deliberations and asked Sabe if he might accompany him, and Sabe agreed.\n\nJijingi had never seen so many elders in one place before; some were even-tempered and dignified like Sabe, while others were loud and full of bluster. They argued for hours on end.\n\nIn the evening after Jijingi had returned, Moseby asked him what it had been like. Jijingi sighed. “Even if they’re not yelling, they’re fighting like wildcats.”\n\n“Who does Sabe think you should join?”\n\n“We should join with the clans that we’re most closely related to; that’s the Tiv way. And since Shangev was the son of Kwande, our clan should join with the Kwande clan, who live to the south.”\n\n“That makes sense,” said Moseby. “So why is there disagreement?”\n\n“The members of the Shangev clan don’t all live next to each other. Some live on the farmland in the west, near the Jechira clan, and the elders there are friendly with the Jechira elders. They’d like the Shangev clan to join the Jechira clan, because then they’d have more influence in the resulting sept.”\n\n“I see.” Moseby thought for a moment. “Could the western Shangev join a different sept from the southern Shangev?”\n\nJijingi shook his head. “We Shangev all have one father, so we should all remain together. All the elders agree on that.”\n\n“But if lineage is so important, how can the elders from the west argue that the Shangev clan ought to join with the Jechira clan?”\n\n“That’s what the disagreement was about. The elders from the west are claiming Shangev was the son of Jechira.”\n\n“Wait, you don’t know who Shangev’s parents were?”\n\n“Of course we know! Sabe can recite his ancestors all the way back to Tiv himself. The elders from the west are merely pretending that Shangev was Jechira’s son because they’d benefit from joining with the Jechira clan.”\n\n“But if the Shangev clan joined with the Kwande clan, wouldn’t your elders benefit?”\n\n“Yes, but Shangev was Kwande’s son.” Then Jijingi realized what Moseby was implying. “You think our elders are the ones pretending!”\n\n“No, not at all. It just sounds like both sides have equally good claims, and there’s no way to tell who’s right.”\n\n“Of course,” said Moseby. “But how can you get the others to admit that? In the land I come from, many people write down their lineage on paper. That way we can trace our ancestry precisely, even many generations in the past.”\n\n“Yes, I’ve seen the lineages in your Bible, tracing Abraham back to Adam.”\n\n“Of course. But even apart from the Bible, people have recorded their lineages. When people want to find out who they’re descended from, they can consult paper. If you had paper, the other elders would have to admit that Sabe was right.”\n\nThat was a good point, Jijingi admitted. If only the Shangev clan had been using paper long ago. Then something occurred to him. “How long ago did the Europeans first come to Tivland?”\n\n“I’m not sure. At least forty years ago, I think.”\n\n“Do you think they might have written down anything about the Shangev clan’s lineage when they first arrived?”\n\nMoseby looked thoughtful. “Perhaps. The administration definitely keeps a lot of records. If there are any, they’d be stored at the government station in Katsina-Ala.”\n\nA truck carried goods along the motor road into Katsina-Ala every fifth day, when the market was being held, and the next market would be the day after tomorrow. If he left tomorrow morning, he could reach the motor road in time to get a ride. “Do you think they would let me see them?”\n\n“It might be easier if you have a European with you,” said Moseby, smiling. “Shall we take a trip?”\n\nNicole opened the door to her apartment and invited me in. She was obviously curious about why I’d come. “So what did you want to talk about?”\n\nI wasn’t sure how to begin. “This is going to sound strange.”\n\nI told her about viewing my partial lifelog using Remem, and seeing the argument we’d had when she was sixteen that ended with me yelling at her and her leaving the house. “Do you remember that day?”\n\n“Of course I do.” She looked uncomfortable, uncertain of where I was going with this.\n\n“I remembered it too, or at least I thought I did. But I remembered it differently. The way I remembered it, it was you who said it to me.”\n\n“I remembered you telling me that I could leave for all you cared, and that you’d be better off without me.”\n\nNicole stared at me for a long time. “All these years, that’s how you’ve remembered that day?”\n\n“That’d almost be funny if it weren’t so sad.”\n\nI felt sick to my stomach. “I’m so sorry. I can’t tell you how sorry I am.”\n\n“Sorry you said it, or sorry that you imagined me saying it?”\n\n“Well you should be! You know how that made me feel?”\n\n“I can’t imagine. I know I felt terrible when I thought you had said it to me.”\n\n“Except that was just something you made up. It actually happened to me.” She shook her head in disbelief. “Fucking typical.”\n\nThat hurt to hear. “Is it? Really?”\n\n“Sure,” she said. “You’re always acting like you’re the victim, like you’re the good guy who deserves to be treated better than you are.”\n\nI bristled a little. “I’m trying to apologize here.”\n\n“Right, right. This is about you.”\n\n“No, you’re right, I’m sorry.” I waited until Nicole gestured for me to go on. “I guess I am…blind and self-absorbed. The reason it’s hard for me to admit that is that I thought I had opened my eyes and gotten over that.”\n\nI told her how I felt like I had turned around as a father and rebuilt our relationship, culminating in a moment of bonding at her college graduation. Nicole wasn’t openly derisive, but her expression caused me to stop talking; it was obvious I was embarrassing myself.\n\n“Did you still hate me at graduation?” I asked. “Was I completely making it up that you and I got along then?”\n\n“No, we did get along at graduation. But it wasn’t because you had magically become a good father.”\n\nShe paused, took a deep breath, and then said, “I started seeing a therapist when I went to college.” She paused again. “She pretty much saved my life.”\n\nMy first thought was, why would Nicole need a therapist ? I pushed that down and said, “I didn’t know you were in therapy.”\n\n“Of course you didn’t; you were the last person I would have told. Anyway, by the time I was a senior, she had convinced me that I was better off not staying angry at you. That’s why you and I got along so well at graduation.”\n\nSo I had indeed fabricated a narrative that bore little resemblance to reality. Nicole had done all the work, and I had done none.\n\nShe shrugged. “You know me as well as you need to.”\n\nThat hurt, too, but I could hardly complain. “You deserve better,” I said.\n\nNicole gave a brief, rueful laugh. “You know, when I was younger, I used to daydream about you saying that. But now…well, it’s not as if it fixes everything, is it?”\n\nI realized that I’d been hoping she would forgive me then and there, and then everything would be good. But it would take more than my saying sorry to repair our relationship.\n\nSomething occurred to me. “I can’t change the things I did, but at least I can stop pretending I didn’t do them. I’m going to use Remem to get a honest picture at myself, take a kind of personal inventory.”\n\nNicole looked at me, gauging my sincerity. “Fine,” she said. “But let’s be clear: you don’t come running to me every time you feel guilty over treating me like crap. I worked hard to put that behind me, and I’m not going to relive it just so you can feel better about yourself.”\n\n“Of course.” I saw that she was tearing up. “And I’ve upset you again by bringing all this up. I’m sorry.”\n\n“It’s all right, Dad. I appreciate what you’re trying to do. Just…let’s not do it again for a while, okay?”\n\n“Right.” I moved toward the door to leave, and then stopped. “I just wanted to ask…if it’s possible, if there’s anything I can do to make amends…”\n\n“Make amends?” She looked incredulous. “I don’t know. Just be more considerate, will you?”\n\nAnd that what I’m trying to do.\n\nAt the government station there was indeed paper from forty years ago, what the Europeans called “assessment reports,” and Moseby’s presence was sufficient to grant them access. They were written in the European language, which Jijingi couldn’t read, but they included diagrams of the ancestry of the various clans, and he could identify the Tiv names in those diagrams easily enough, and Moseby had confirmed that his interpretation was correct. The elders in the western farms were right, and Sabe was wrong: Shangev was not Kwande’s son, he was Jechira’s.\n\nOne of the men at the government station had agreed to type up a copy of the relevant page so Jijingi could take it with him. Moseby decided to stay in Katsina-Ala to visit with the missionaries there, but Jijingi came home right away. He felt like an impatient child on the return trip, wishing he could ride the truck all the way back instead of having to walk from the motor road. As soon as he had arrived at the village, Jijingi looked for Sabe.\n\nHe found him on the path leading to a neighboring farm; some neighbors had stopped Sabe to have him settle a dispute over how a nanny goat’s kids should be distributed. Finally, they were satisfied, and Sabe resumed his walk. Jijingi walked beside him.\n\n“Ah. Why did you go there?”\n\nJijingi showed him the paper. “This was written long ago, when the Europeans first came here. They spoke to the elders of the Shangev clan then, and when the elders told them the history of the Shangev clan, they said that Shangev was the son of Jechira.”\n\nSabe’s reaction was mild. “Whom did the Europeans ask?”\n\nJijingi looked at the paper. “Batur and Iorkyaha.”\n\n“I remember them,” he said, nodding. “They were wise men. They would not have said such a thing.”\n\nJijingi pointed at the words on the page. “But they did!”\n\n“Perhaps you are reading it wrong.”\n\n“I am not! I know how to read.”\n\nSabe shrugged. “Why did you bring this paper back here?”\n\n“What it says is important. It means we should rightfully be joined with the Jechira clan.”\n\n“You think the clan should trust your decision on this matter?”\n\n“I’m not asking the clan to trust me. I’m asking them to trust the men who were elders when you were young.”\n\n“And so they should. But those men aren’t here. All you have is paper.”\n\n“The paper tells us what they would say if they were here.”\n\n“Does it? A man doesn’t speak only one thing. If Batur and Iorkyaha were here, they would agree with me that we should join with the Kwande clan.”\n\n“How could they, when Shangev was the son of Jechira?” He pointed at the sheet of paper. “The Jechira are our closer kin.”\n\nSabe stopped walking and turned to face Jijingi. “Questions of kinship cannot be resolved by paper. You’re a scribe because Maisho of the Kwande clan warned me about the boys from the mission school. Maisho wouldn’t have looked out for us if we didn’t share the same father. Your position is proof of how close our clans are, but you forget that. You look to paper to tell you what you should already know, here.” Sabe tapped him on his chest. “Have you studied paper so much that you’ve forgotten what it is to be Tiv?”\n\nJijingi opened his mouth to protest when he realized that Sabe was right. All the time he’d spent studying writing had made him think like a European. He had come to trust what was written on paper over what was said by people, and that wasn’t the Tiv way.\n\nThe assessment report of the Europeans was vough ; it was exact and precise, but that wasn’t enough to settle the question. The choice of which clan to join with had to be right for the community; it had to be mimi . Only the elders could determine what was mimi ; it was their responsibility to decide what was best for the Shangev clan. Asking Sabe to defer to the paper was asking him to act against what he considered right.\n\n“You’re right, Sabe,” he said. “Forgive me. You’re my elder, and it was wrong of me to suggest that paper could know more than you.”\n\nSabe nodded and resumed walking. “You are free to do as you wish, but I believe it will do more harm than good to show that paper to others.”\n\nJijingi considered it. The elders from the western farms would undoubtedly argue that the assessment report supported their position, prolonging a debate that had already gone too long. But more than that, it would move the Tiv down the path of regarding paper as the source of truth; it would be another stream in which the old ways were washing away, and he could see no benefit in it.\n\n“I agree,” said Jijingi. “I won’t show this to anyone else.”\n\nJijingi walked back to his hut, reflecting on what had happened. Even without attending a mission school, he had begun thinking like a European; his practice of writing in his notebooks had led him to disrespect his elders without him even being aware of it. Writing helped him think more clearly, he couldn’t deny that; but that wasn’t good enough reason to trust paper over people.\n\nAs a scribe, he had to keep the book of Sabe’s decisions in tribal court. But he didn’t need to keep the other notebooks, the ones in which he’d written down his thoughts. He would use them as tinder for the cooking fire.\n\nWe don’t normally think of it as such, but writing is a technology, which means that a literate person is someone whose thought processes are technologically mediated. We became cognitive cyborgs as soon as we became fluent readers, and the consequences of that were profound.\n\nBefore a culture adopts the use of writing, when its knowledge is transmitted exclusively through oral means, it can very easily revise its history. It’s not intentional, but it is inevitable; throughout the world, bards and griots have adapted their material to their audiences, and thus gradually adjusted the past to suit the needs of the present. The idea that accounts of the past shouldn’t change is a product of literate cultures’ reverence for the written word. Anthropologists will tell you that oral cultures understand the past differently; for them, their histories don’t need to be accurate so much as they need to validate the community’s understanding of itself. So it wouldn’t be correct to say that their histories are unreliable; their histories do what they need to do.\n\nRight now each of us is a private oral culture. We rewrite our pasts to suit our needs and support the story we tell about ourselves. With our memories we are all guilty of a Whig interpretation of our personal histories, seeing our former selves as steps toward our glorious present selves.\n\nBut that era is coming to an end. Remem is merely the first of a new generation of memory prostheses, and as these products gain widespread adoption, we will be replacing our malleable organic memories with perfect digital archives. We will have a record of what we actually did instead of stories that evolve over repeated tellings. Within our minds, each of us will be transformed from an oral culture into a literate one.\n\nIt would be easy for me to assert that literate cultures are better off than oral ones, but my bias should be obvious, since I’m writing these words rather than speaking them to you. Instead I will say that it’s easier for me to appreciate the benefits of literacy and harder to recognize everything it has cost us. Literacy encourages a culture to place more value on documentation and less on subjective experience, and overall I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Written records are subject to every kind of error and their interpretation is subject to change, but at least the words on the page remain fixed, and there is real merit in that.\n\nWhen it comes to our individual memories, I live on the opposite side of the divide. As someone whose identity was built on organic memory, I’m threatened by the prospect of removing subjectivity from our recall of events. I used to think it could be valuable for individuals to tell stories about themselves, valuable in a way that it couldn’t be for cultures, but I’m a product of my time, and times change. We can’t prevent the adoption of digital memory any more than oral cultures could stop the arrival of literacy, so the best I can do is look for something positive in it.\n\nAnd I think I’ve found the real benefit of digital memory. The point is not to prove you were right; the point is to admit you were wrong.\n\nBecause all of us have been wrong on various occasions, engaged in cruelty and hypocrisy, and we’ve forgotten most of those occasions. And that means we don’t really know ourselves. How much personal insight can I claim if I can’t trust my memory? How much can you? You’re probably thinking that, while your memory isn’t perfect, you’ve never engaged in revisionism of the magnitude I’m guilty of. But I was just as certain as you, and I was wrong. You may say, “I know I’m not perfect. I’ve made mistakes.” I am here to tell you that you have made more than you think, that some of the core assumptions on which your self-image is built are actually lies. Spend some time using Remem, and you’ll find out.\n\nBut the reason I now recommend Remem is not for the shameful reminders it provides of your past; it’s to avoid the need for those in the future. Organic memory was what enabled me to construct a whitewashed narrative of my parenting skills, but by using digital memory from now on, I hope to keep that from happening. The truth about my behavior won’t be presented to me by someone else, making me defensive; it won’t even be something I’ll discover as a private shock, prompting a reevaluation. With Remem providing only the unvarnished facts, my image of myself will never stray too far from the truth in the first place.\n\nDigital memory will not stop us from telling stories about ourselves. As I said earlier, we are made of stories, and nothing can change that. What digital memory will do is change those stories from fabulations that emphasize our best acts and elide our worst, into ones that—I hope—acknowledge our fallibility and make us less judgmental about the fallibility of others.\n\nNicole has begun using Remem as well, and discovered that her recollection of events isn’t perfect either. This hasn’t made her forgive me for the way I treated her—nor should it, because her misdeeds were minor compared to mine—but it has softened her anger at my misremembering my actions, because she realizes it’s something we all do. And I’m embarrassed to admit that this is precisely the scenario Erica Meyers predicted when she talked about Remem’s effects on relationships.\n\nThis doesn’t mean I’ve changed my mind about the downsides of digital memory; there are many, and people need to be aware of them. I just don’t think I can argue the case with any sort of objectivity anymore. I abandoned the article I was planning to write about memory prostheses; I handed off the research I’d done to a colleague, and she wrote a fine piece about the pros and cons of the software, a dispassionate article free from all the soul-searching and angst that would have saturated anything I submitted. Instead, I’ve written this.\n\nThe account I’ve given of the Tiv is based in fact, but isn’t precisely accurate. There was indeed a dispute among the Tiv in 1941 over whom the Shangev clan should join with, based on differing claims about the parentage of the clan’s founder, and administrative records did show that the clan elders’ account of their genealogy had changed over time. But many of the specific details I’ve described are invented. The actual events were more complicated and less dramatic, as actual events always are, so I have taken liberties to make a better narrative. I’ve told a story in order to make a case for the truth. I recognize the contradiction here.\n\nAs for my account of my argument with Nicole, I’ve tried to make it as accurate as I possibly could. I’ve been recording everything since I started working on this project, and I’ve consulted the recordings repeatedly when writing this. But in my choice of which details to include and which to omit, perhaps I have just constructed another story. In spite of my efforts to be unflinching, have I flattered myself with this portrayal? Have I distorted events so they more closely follow the arc expected of a confessional narrative? The only way you can judge is by comparing my account against the recordings themselves, so I’m doing something I never thought I’d do: with Nicole’s permission, I am granting public access to my lifelog, such as it is. Take a look at the video, and decide for yourself.\n\nAnd if you think I’ve been less than honest, tell me. I want to know.\n\nThe following titles will be published by Subterranean Press in the near future:\n\nby Neil Gaiman and Michael Reaves and Mallory Reaves\n\nThe following titles have been earmarked

Death Comes - by Shaun Usher - Letters of Note","link":"https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/when-death-comes?s=r","content":"Although ultimately about hope, the following letter discusses suicide ideation. Proceed with caution.\n\nIn 2015, then-16-year-old Aidan Kingwell was tasked by her English teacher to write to someone who had influenced her in some way . The result was this letter, addressed to Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Mary Oliver, whose words—her poem When Death Comes, specifically—had helped Kingwell during a particularly dark time as a young teenager, and during moments of depression ever since. Frustratingly, despite my best efforts, I’m not allowed to reprint that poem here; however, I’m sure you can find it elsewhere, including in Oliver’s New and Selected Poems, Volume One , first published in 1992. Thankfully, it’s not essential. This letter is a powerful piece of writing that stands on its own.\n\nI know it’s an unconventional subject for a letter: death. A fact of life that most of us endeavor to avoid, or at least ignore. But I, Mary — I have walked side by side with death all of my life.\n\nI was thirteen the first time I read your poem, and at that time in my life, there was a good chance that I would not see my fourteenth birthday. I had been depressed since age ten, but I had never received any treatment. My mind was very dark; I dove deeper and deeper into my own twisted thoughts with each passing moment. I was someone who was simultaneously terrified of dying and yet obsessed with the idea. I was suicidal, which is a state of being that I cannot well describe, because there are not words that can describe such utter loss of hope, such bitterness and pain and unrelenting sorrow. I wanted to end my own life so badly that most days I could not find one single reason for living. It was not a cry for attention; it was a feeling of utter self-hatred. There is also no accurate way to describe the feeling of hating yourself and your life so much that you long to end it all. It is a feeling of being trapped, of being insane, of being hopeless. When you are suicidal, you are like a wild animal just barely being contained by a thin human shell. Your soul is empty and your heart is blackened and dead. You have no straws left to grasp, no ladder to climb out of the abyss; the only rope offered to help you scramble out is in the shape of a noose, and after weeks or months or years, that noose begins to look very, very appealing.\n\nSo there I stood, face-to-face with death on a daily basis, wondering if each new day was the day that it would finally consume me. I was afraid of my own mind. I found no comfort in wooden crosses or the taste of bitter crackers, nor in the deluded words of psychiatrists. That eventual uncertainty — the uncertainty of the terror of my own death — haunted my footsteps as I walked from day to day, wearing it like a heavy, bitter cloak. The very idea of my own death was killing me.\n\nThen, one day, in my seventh-grade English class, I was presented with your poem. My teacher referred to it as “a dark poem with a note of hope underlying it,” but within it, I found so much more. Within it, I found new life. My mind opened up as I read your words; I was a frail but inspired butterfly clawing my way from a dark, putrid cocoon. The way you spoke, Mary; the way you talked about death, and how he will come to buy you with “all the bright coins from his purse,” how he will come “like an iceberg between the shoulder blades.” I could tell: you knew. You knew what it felt like to be owned by death’s shadow, in the same way that I was then. You had felt the same terror, the same all-consuming dread. But you were also strong. You faced death and said that it did not own you; you had looked into death’s dark eyes and said, “No, you cannot have me; I am not yet done here.”\n\nWhen you spoke of not wanting to have simply visited this world, my own world turned upside down. I began to think about how horrible it would be to have only been a visitor, in the way that you said: to not have made my mark on the world, to have only passed through with no real substance. I thought of a life lived entirely in absence of beauty and amazement, a life barren of love or excitement or laughter. I began to realize that that was what suicide would do to me. I saw that life was fast becoming my own. I saw that killing myself would take me away before I even had the chance to make something of my life. Suicide would eliminate my pain, yes, but it would also close any doors of possibility that I might have still open to me, doors that may lead to happiness in my future.\n\nI never would have imagined, Mary, that not killing myself would be one of the hardest decisions that I would ever have to make. But in the end, I made the choice, and I am still alive today. My life has not been full of joy; in fact, it has been dark, and hard, and at times I have even slipped back into death’s unrelenting grasp. But at those times, I have reminded myself of what I thought then — that I want to make something of my life, and that ending it would mean turning my back on all future possibilities, as well as the few pieces of happiness that I have managed to find in the present. At those dark times, Mary, I often also read your poem to myself — the poem that catalyzed my grand suicidal epiphany. I still struggle with this menace, but now I have one thing that I did not have before: I have hope.\n\n“When Death Comes,” Mary — and it will — I want to face it as an equal, and shake its hand as a friend, and accept it as an eventuality. You taught me that that is the only proper way to die. With your words you taught me that life cannot be lived in the shadow of death — that life must be a thing separate from death. And you taught me that when death comes, I should embrace it, but also that I should not welcome it before its time. You taught me, Mary, that there was nothing to be feared in death so long as my life was one well lived.\n\n“I don’t want to end up simply having visited this world,” you wrote.\n\nAnd “When Death Comes,” Mary, I will tell it that you were my friend. Because you were. I will tell it that I am armed with your words, and it will bow its dark face in respect, and then, it will offer me its hand and lead me into whatever may or may not lay behind it. I will feel no fear, Mary — I no longer fear death and all its ways. I will know that I have beaten death down with your words and the inspiration that they gave me. I will know that I did not let it take me in any way but the one I wanted. And I will know that my life, no matter how twisted, corrupt, and fearful, was worth living.\n\nSo thank you, Mary. Thank you for wrenching death’s grip from my wrist. Thank you for showing me that the burden of my soul was not so dark. That there was still hope left in me.\n\nFrom JOURNEYS: YOUNG READERS' LETTERS TO AUTHORS WHO CHANGED THEIR LIVES. Copyright © 2017 by the Library of Congress.

The house they plan to buy. The children they plan to have. They have ambitious desires, involving attaining a certain net worth, certain material acquisitions, certain beauty standards. Their lives are predicated upon the belief that satisfaction, perhaps even happiness, is found through these pursuits, this climbing of ladders , and getting to the very top. And that, to them, is the very meaning of life.\n\nThey know, it seemed, what they want in life, and they’re well on their way to achieving those things. In the words of my favorite coach, “clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” Of course, there is always the possibility that they’ll have the house in Santa Barbara (and in New York and in Marin), the time-share in Vail, the beautiful children, the private jet, the vacations in Italy, the yacht life in Greece, the .1% life, and still find it wanting. But they’re willing to find out. In fact, their entire lives are devoted to finding out — to reaching the good life — their definition of the good life — and then taking in the view.\n\nWhile these aspirations didn’t resonate with me, they spoke of these goals with such certainty that I couldn’t help but feel admiration — and envy. They just know. Somehow, for as long as they can remember, they’ve known what the good life, to them, is. They’ve always had conviction that their definition of a good life was the right definition. They’ve always known the “correct” choices that would take them there. They know themselves — they know what they value, what they care about, what makes life fulfilling for them, and because of that, they have purpose, and they have agency in their lives.\n\nMy life, so far, has been pure, dumb luck. I came to the career I have by chance circumstances (my parents moved to Silicon Valley when I was in high school); a process of elimination (I didn’t enjoy the other tech industry roles I’d tried); maybe a modicum of intuition (I’ve always been drawn to aesthetics and art). But I could have easily had an entirely different career — in journalism (I almost attended Northwestern’s Medill Journalism School); in law (I took the LSATs), in non-profits (I interned at the ACLU), in government (the CIA recruited me while I was in college), in humanitarianism or international development (I worked for several social enterprises and considered moving to Nairobi to work for a payments startup); in academia. I had a fling with designing leather purses; I write in my down time because I don’t know any other way to live. And that’s just my career. My life is littered with ghost ships, with broken sails and missing floorboards, fallen to the wayside.\n\nI’ll never know and neither will you of the life you don’t choose. We’ll only know that whatever that sister life was, it was important and beautiful and not ours. It was the ghost ship that didn’t carry us. There’s nothing to do but salute it from the shore.\n\nI’ll never know of the life I didn’t have — but it’s imprecise to suggest that these are lives that I didn’t choose. Rather, they became ghost ships more from neglect than from intentional abandonment — though I have hope that Mark Manson is right in his “fuck yes or fuck no” philosophy that that is a choice, in and of itself.\n\nOnce upon a time, I was religious, and I believed that God had a plan for me. In another era, the “everything happens for a reason” narrative would have saved me from myself. The older I get, the less I believe in fate, whether from the gods or in the stars. Now, in looking back, the course of my life might be personified by Timothée Chalamet’s listless, yearning character in Call Me By Your Name — floating in a lake, stone fruit in one hand, dazzled by the light on the water, by laughter that’s both distant and near, lines of conversations, music, books running through my mind, waiting to grow up.\n\nI wonder if my lack of plan — and seemingly, of purpose, is related to my detachment from my emotions. In the past year, I’ve become alarmingly aware that, while my inner world has always been rich and full, my emotional life has been quiet, muted. I’m able to think about, even talk about objectively traumatic childhood experiences — being held at gunpoint in Disney World, being hit by a car walking alone to school in the 4th grade — with passivity, even peacefulness. In an emotionally-suppressed and inexpressive family, I never learned how to show emotion appropriately. Instead, I learned, from a young age, to suffer silently, to turn inward whenever something hurt. When we were long-distance, my college boyfriend complained that I was never excited to see him, when I felt like I spent my days pining for the next time I did. My first boyfriend in San Francisco took me to multi-course Michelin-star meals and remarked that I never seemed impressed, when, at 21, I felt pure awe at the world he had introduced me to. Without a timely, or a decipherable emotional reaction to an event, it’s been impossible to know what I like or don’t like, what makes me happy or unhappy. Instead, I intellectualized life and how I chose to live it; I’m justice-oriented, passionate about matters of morality, reliant on the musings of long-gone philosophers. Now, I’m trying to pay attention not only to how I feel, but to where that feeling is coming from — back to basics.\n\nOr maybe it’s because I’m overwhelmed by all that the world offers. How can I choose? How can anyone choose? As Charlie Kaufman says in Adaptation, “There are too many ideas and things and people. Too many directions to go.” I want to believe that, if it one day struck my fancy, I could revisit and revive a ghost ship or two. I want to hold onto possibilities, and by virtue, I want to hold onto not knowing, onto uncertainty, onto ambiguity. “I was starting to believe the reason it matters to care passionately about something, is that it whittles the world down to a more manageable size.” But what if I’m desperately afraid of whittling the world down at all?\n\nIn a zero-sum reality in which we can only have one-at-a-time of everything that matters, saying yes to something is saying no to something else. New beginnings necessitate endings; the act of choosing is also the act of destroying. Marriage is a reminder of the passage of time; birth is a reminder of mortality. I’ve been resistant to “settling down,” to checking off the default milestones, because each chapter is closer to the inevitable end and this is a story I’m rather enjoying, despite its meanders and non-sequiturs. For so long, I conflated contentment with complacency and complacency with decay. Contentment signaled the end of striving — a kind of giving up.\n\nAs with my career, I realized my values through a process of elimination. It was easier to discover what I didn’t like than what I did. I felt it first in my body: discomfort, even repulsion — to people who seemed manipulative, exploitative, untrustworthy; to people who showed up as inauthentic; to people who seemed flat or hollow. In response, I began to seek generosity, integrity, authenticity, curiosity, and dynamism.\n\nAnd yet, these values, in their nebulousness, continue to prolong the ambiguity, to delay making a choice. What does it mean to live a kind and authentic life? What does it look like? How do these values translate into something tangible, something real — into an actual lived life? I can’t critique the lives my friends have envisioned for themselves when I haven’t had the courage to even put a stake in the ground, set a destination, point toward my own north star — never mind chart a course.\n\nMaybe our society is more amenable to the pursuit of certain values over others. Maybe power, status, wealth, physical beauty have an unfair advantage because their pursuit has been normalized, their paths more taken. The shape that a life that honors wealth and beauty is a distinct one — each and everyone of us can imagine what such a life looks like. We’ve been surrounded by their physical representations, indoctrinated into their cult. And for good reason. In a capitalist society, all signs point to wealth — power, status, and physical beauty are direct and indirect routes, often pursued in service of achieving wealth. In our culture, these values have been mythologized; in our society, they’ve been internalized as virtuous. Wouldn’t life be easier if I believed that too?\n\nAs I write this, I’m reminded of a very different way of living. Years ago, on the edge of a breakup, I went on a solo trip to Austria and Germany. In Berlin, I stayed at a communal space, owned by an architect named Reinhard. Traveling artists of different stripes came and went, for gigs, for galleries, for wandering. There were always students and beautiful young girls drinking tea and drawing in pastels. One day, I came home after a full day of visiting museums and eating cake in cafés. I ran into two of Reinhard’s roommates in the kitchen. One of them commented that I really liked to be on the go. The other told me about her day: “I woke up and I really wanted to take a bath, but there was no hot water! So I took a big pot and boiled water over and over and poured it into the bathtub until it was full. Then I had a bath. Then I went to the supermarket and got bread and this bio-chocolate,” gesturing toward a block of dark chocolate. She sliced off a piece with a butcher knife and offered it to me. “Isn’t it heavenly?” she sighed. “Isn’t this the good life?”\n\nI’ll leave you with this:\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

are the New Platforms - by David Phelps","link":"https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/people-are-the-new-platforms?s=r","content":"Conceived, outlined, and edited by Jad Esber, Nir Kabessa, and David Phelps; written up by David Phelps.\n\nThere is perhaps no more cringe combo of three words.\n\nBut—god help us all—Zuck is right:\n\n“I’ve talked a bunch about how I think that we should design our computing platforms around people rather than apps and I guess that’s sort of what I’m talking about.\n\nOn phones today, the foundational element is an app, right? That’s the organizing principle for kind of your phone and how you navigate it.\n\nBut I would hope that in the future, the organizing principle will be you, your identity, your stuff, your digital goods, your connections, and then you’ll be able to pretty seamlessly go between different experiences and different devices on that.” — Interview with Ben Thompson\n\nHowever out of touch with reality he may sound, Mark Zuckerberg is, unfortunately, very in touch with his newly branded metaverse. Let’s note that on three counts.\n\nFirst, Zuckerberg senses opportunity in fragmentation to lay the tracks of the online railroad—an “organizing principle” that will apply universally across the internet and potentially all computers. The internet, we could say, is still running in a fairly agrarian economy, as that most precious digital commodity—data—is consigned to the localities of individual platforms: Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, TikTok, and, yes, Facebook. The metaverse, Zuckerberg suggests, is a railroad between these local economies that lets them exchange data with the user’s permission. But just because the user has rights does not mean that they have financial upside. Zuckerberg’s railroad is also, after all, a toll.\n\nSecond, even as Zuckerberg wants to lay the rails to make data universally transmissible across platforms, he also wants to make data collection, control, and communication even more fragmented. The basis for a new internet, Zuckerberg hints, is a kind of back-closet storage bin, overstuffed with forgotten sweaters and discarded posters of our favorite bands: “your identity, your stuff, your digital goods, your connections.” Zuckerberg understands that in web3 fragmentation is inevitable, as users come to own and manage their data and metadata management—even if, in the world of Meta, they’re not quite able to monetize it. After all, people still need to manage their own data not only to cart it contiguously from one platform to another but in order to experience a metaverse uniquely tailored to the the proclivities of the individual taste, skills, and social networks. Our experience of the metaverse, Zuckerberg suggests, must be individualized to the individual.\n\nAt first glance, these two principles—for an internet of completely universal standards and an internet of completely individual standards—might seem to be in conflict. But note Zuckerberg’s key word here: the real purpose of both is to move from device-to-device, world-to-world seamlessly. To move seamlessly in our own private metaverse, we need a universal catalog of all available experiences to give us personalized options. These two principles of a universal internet and a fragmented internet, in other words, are fully codependent. For each is based around the same premise that it’s individuals who take the place of platforms in aggregating and conveying data—with each other and with the platforms themselves.\n\nAll three points, in other words, come down to a much simpler one. When people own their own content, including its data and metadata, they own its distribution as well. They become the new intermediaries.\n\nPeople become the new platforms.\n\nThen again, we might say that people are the old platforms: after all, the internet was founded as a p2p network of individuals working not only to connect to each other, but to connect each other to each other (hence early chat rooms). So why would web3 return us to this seemingly antiquated model after web2’s hegemonic consolidation of winner-takes-all platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram? To see what’s radically different between web1 and web3, consider the example of Brave Browser: advertisers pay the browser’s users to watch ads through Brave’s native token, with users making more than twice as much revenue as Brave itself. Users take the place of the traditional ad platform, even as they’re directly incentivized to share Brave itself as newfound token-holders. It’s one thing for users to connect their network to new platforms, as in web1—it’s another when they have the incentives to do so.\n\nSo by letting people meaningfully own digital content for the first time, web3 doesn’t just shift ownership away from platforms towards their users. More significantly, it incentivizes users to become content distributors as well—to become, well, platforms themselves.\n\nAll of that might sound like an exclusionary landgrab for the internet, as if web3’s crypto-nouveau-riche were hoping to leverage their money vaults of $DOGE for that greatest of contemporary powers: the power to shill their bags. This narrative makes it easy to understand why people are the new platforms. What matters most in web3 is our personal voices, the louder and more subjective the better, to sell ourselves and our portfolio.\n\nLet’s run with this narrative for a moment. Web3, here, just adds financial incentives to the internet’s longer-standing social ones. The promise of online identities, pliant shadows of our clunkier physical selves, has always lain in our ability to manipulate them for social and financial capital; hyperfinancialization, in this narrative, just becomes an added incentive to larp, to build the most successful-if-not-always-true version of oneself that one can. Web3 incentivizes us, in other words, to be prominent voices of thought and empathy, the better to become prominent shills.\n\nBut here we need to acknowledge a countervailing narrative. Web3 doesn’t just incentivize people to promote narratives by giving them open-market opportunities to buy and sell; it gives them the tools to promote narratives in place of centralized marketplaces that would have traditionally served as the toll-keepers for discovering items and information online. For as important as the incentives for shilling information are, they’re born out of the foundations of distributed ledgers to acquire, understand, and, yes, share this information in fully decentralized ways.\n\nTake, for example, Dune dashboards : anyone can create a dashboard aggregating on-chain data to showcase the relative financial success of different projects. Being good at analytics is the new way of being good at promotion. Everyone becomes an advertiser. Or take The Graph . Users can stake The Graph’s own token as a vote to “curate” their favorite projects—signalling that they’d like indexers to index data for these projects. We’re no longer just incentivized to share information, but now have the tools to incentivize others to get us the information to share. Everyone becomes a marketing agency.\n\nThe reclamation of hyperfinancialization for ourselves, then, is simply a logical conclusion of disintermediating legacy players that have long dictated how we’re perceived on the internet, and how we perceive the internet itself: what information is surfaced and what items we’re told to buy. In web3, we decide these ourselves.\n\nBut taking data into our hands in terms of how we see it, manage it, own it, and financialize it—this is still only web3’s first step, its opening gambit. The next step isn’t merely offering tools for users to track information, but to develop it, to create their own protocols for making contributions and receiving rewards on-chain. Uniswap is one example here: anyone can become a liquidity provider to earn the majority of value in place of traditional market makers. Of all the “Ubers of [random industry]” pitches from the past decade, Uniswap is arguably the Uber of Wall Street, letting anyone populate its marketplace, with a twist that LPs don’t form the supply side of a transaction but enable the transaction itself. Users are the marketplace. Uniswap points to the increasing power of individuals not just to build out platforms like Dune or The Graph but become platforms themselves.\n\nIn other words, the next step is not giving users ways to aggregate existing types of data, but to mediate and collect new forms of data altogether.\n\nOr more simply, the next step is giving users ways to build their own platforms.\n\nAnd in that sense, web3 marks both the culmination of a past decade of user-generated creation that has seen the cost of code fall dramatically as well as the inception of permissionless building. Together, these two trends are what unlock this next wave for people to become their own platforms.\n\nFirst, the cost of code is low. For all its promise of degen 14 year olds coding billion-dollar defi protocols, web3 is, in some ways, a culmination of the past decade of no-code solutions. Because smart contracts are open-source, anybody can use or modify them; basic financial functions like splitting income among multiple parties that would have required months of dev work with Stripe can now be performed with a split contract in a few minutes through a site like Mirror.\n\nIn other words, open-source protocols accelerate innovation by letting anyone build, so that with proper financial incentives for creators, they can quickly take the place of closed web2 protocols. That makes it hard for platforms to extract value, however, since open-source environments let anyone fork the platform and redeploy it with lower commissions to attract consumers: this is famously what SushiSwap did to Uniswap, forking the protocol to offer extra fees to users, and what Hive users did to Steemit after frustration from Tron’s takeover. So the real winner here is the individual consumer. Platforms lose their moat when others can hard-fork them in cheaper, community-run versions, and consumers win with lower fees.\n\nBut here’s where it gets interesting. Let’s remember that the individual consumer is also someone who’s able to build out the platform in a low-code environment—and incentivized to do so by holding a token. Smart contract composability, the premise that one smart contract can call on the data and functions of another the way a DJ might remix another artist’s work, is typically understood as software legos: the ability of one dev to build on another’s code.\n\nThe implications, however, redefine business as we know it. After all, companies no longer need to build code from scratch in siloed environments when they can draw on each other’s work. More to the point, companies no longer need to exist when individuals can just build on top of each other’s work for cheap. As we’ve seen with Rari, a DeFi aggregator built by teenagers with over $1B in TVL , anyone with a computer and a bit of dev experience can—in theory—create a protocol.\n\nAnd this is the point of our second trend: it’s easier than ever to make content when that content is participatory/responsive to other content and built on top of it, whether through subtweets, TikTok responses, hard-forks, or composable smart contracts. In short, the shifts we’ve seen play out over the past decade in the creator economy are now transpiring in tech. Just as the rise of influencers and fall of corporate legitimacy left individuals to become the primary distribution for brands and eventually to form their own (Tyler, Rihanna, even George Clooney), a few individual devs can take the place of entire corporations in building decentralized financial rails.\n\nAnd just as fans have increasingly become creators by recomposing creators’ work on platforms like TikTok, users of DAOs and protocols are increasingly their workers as well, helping build out their communities and code as composability dissolves the lines between consumption and creation.\n\nAll of which explains how people can become their own platforms. But the deeper question is: dubious tokens aside, why would they?\n\nWho are we online? Well, up until now, we’ve left breadcrumbs of who we are across siloed platforms: our music preferences on Spotify, our favorite restaurants on OpenTable, our professional self lives on LinkedIn. Basically, we’ve been mini-piles of data in the image of each platform we use, able to express ourselves only so far as the platform would let us—like bowls of ingredients that have never been combined to make a dish.\n\nWe’ve had to split our identities to fit the contexts of different platforms, a kind of hyper-actualization of our tendencies (and instincts) to adapt who we are in different physical spaces and communities. We might see the fundamental promise of the internet here—that we can explore ourselves online without fear of scrutiny or judgment. To paraphrase Marx, we might hunt for jobs on LinkedIn in the morning, fish for compliments on Instagram in the afternoon, criticize each other on Twitter after dinner, and be as lascivious as we like on Tinder in the late evening, without letting any of these identities define us.\n\nNevertheless, something is lost in this fractionalization of the self into a series of performance pieces—not only in the division of ourselves into separate entities, but in the ways we construct ourselves according to the limited mandates of each platform.\n\nOn the simplest level, web3 can allow us to “bring our whole selves” to platforms without fear of scrutiny or judgment by aggregating our online data and sharing the parts we find relevant to receive better recommendations and find better opportunities. Web3 enables us to traverse all these spaces and carry this identity—in the form of an address with on-chain data—across them while having control to share those parts of ourselves that we choose.\n\nTo put this in web2 terms, you might use the data from the videos you watch on YouTube to help determine the music you would like on Spotify—and you might choose to share that data with advertising protocols as well to earn directly from ads relevant to your taste and needs in the ways that social media platforms have always done on your behalf. (Indeed, the benefits of cross-platform data aggregation help explain Google and Facebook’s success not for any given product, but for collating products across our professional and personal lives). Adult entertainment platforms will likely be some of the first to harness web3 curation, not only because decentralization can relieve users’ fears of corporate surveillance that prevent them from sharing more data currently, but because that data can be used to deliver more targeted results for different users.\n\nBut more importantly, web3 can let us transcend the limited language of existing platforms by creating more advanced living, breathing identities on-chain. Our data doesn’t need to be limited to our music selections or our conversations with strangers on dating apps. It can include our contributions to building communities in DAOs, to writing articles that others draw on and quote, to our success in promoting others around us. For better or worse, it will increasingly include biometrics as well—cortisol levels, blood sugar, heartbeat, how we make eye contact, how we smile, how we walk. The point ultimately is that it will showcase who we are not simply as checkboxes of consumer taste, but active creators, contributors, and collaborators—as humans.\n\nThe real promise of data ownership, it turns out, isn’t simply that we can store, monetize, and share data ourselves. It’s that the incentives to do so will also incentivize us to track more advanced and individuated data than ever before. In the short run, that data will let us replicate our offline identities on-chain as we showcase our personal skills and accomplishments. In the long run, that data will let us automate our online behaviors, from writing emails to making investments, as we shift from online actors to online curators, merely confirming the actions we want our online selves to perform.\n\nAnd in the longest run, we’ll be able to create versions of ourselves online that are no longer skeuomorphic approximations of our offline selves, but collective creations—selves that may write emails for us based on collective data, perhaps, or even selves that communicate with each other without any need for email at all. Perhaps, ultimately, we’ll become their creations, as they redirect our own everyday actions based on the data of those similar to us so we can better optimize our time.\n\nAnd ultimately? We may end up back with multiple versions of ourselves, various characters in the giant RPG that is being online: the job-hunter, the compliment-fisher, the critic, the flirt. But these versions of ourselves won’t be tied to specific platforms. They’ll be full-fledged creations, alts that enable us to become new people both online and off. Instead of assuming whatever identity Linkedin, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter preformat us into, our online identities will become Linkedin, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter themselves: data aggregators that take on identities based on the data of those closest to us and help shape their identity in turn.\n\nAt that point, we’re not so far from who we are in real life, creators and creations of the social constructs around us. This is why becoming our own platforms is so powerful, so promising, and potentially a bit perturbing as well.\n\nBack in 2016, Joel Monegro proposed the central difference for building businesses on blockchains vs. the internet: on the internet, platforms like Google and Facebook capture value on top of largely valueless open-source protocols (TCP/IP) whereas on distributed ledgers, the protocols themselves capture value in the form of a state-like currency that reflects the GDP-like value of the applications being built on top of it. The catch, for Monegro, is that blockchain applications on top of protocols struggle to accrue value themselves—not just because they’re open-source, interoperable, user-owned, and don’t own their own liquidity, but simply because users will invest in the underlying protocol in order to invest in the applications on top. So value accrues to the protocol’s token that applications use.\n\nYears later, every application has their own damn token, with two consequences that might seem to threaten Monegro’s thesis: first, value *can* accrue at the platform level through its own currency, and second, having far more tokens with far less value means that there are real switching costs for moving from one platform to another as liquidity vanishes. They may represent fleeting victories, but Uniswap and OpenSea are both stories of conquering liquidity of micro-micro-caps.\n\nSo much for the fat protocol thesis, we might say. The platforms of web3 start to look a lot like the p2p platforms of web2 and web1: the Pipes, the Airbnbs, the Ebays that win markets by capturing liquidity for rare, non-fungible items and services , their strong liquidity moat giving them strong commissions.\n\nBut there is a difference. Because: to get users in the first place, platforms have to increasingly airdrop their token that incentivizes users not only to use the platform, but more importantly, grow its long-term value by getting their network to use it as well. No self-respecting platform under the watchful eyes of the SEC would say that they’re user-owned, exactly, but the fact that platforms have to give up a marketized share of governance to their users tells us what’s so revolutionary about web3. The users and management are no longer on opposite sides of a transaction but deeply aligned. In some sense, the platforms belong to the people.\n\nAnd what if users dump the token for a quick eth or two? A token can acquire a user, but it can’t retain them—for that, users have to collectively decide that the project and the token are actually worth something to them practically, socially, and emotionally. The real value is determined by social consensus of users coming together to prop up a token’s value just enough to incentivize others to care about the project too. Even public markets don’t operate this way, with the speculators generating usage rather than users generating speculation. The value is truly in the hands of the people.\n\nBut there’s one final opportunity that remains untapped, the stuff of the next few years. Users don’t simply control their data on web3 platforms—their tokens, their contributions, their social records—but will increasingly have ways to leverage that data as on-chain credentials for joining emergent communities, testing their predictions, and getting jobs. Platforms’ secret opportunity is in incentivizing collection of this data for users to leverage. This may sound counterintuitive when platforms don’t own users’ data in web3, but there are two underlying points.\n\nFirst, platforms have an opportunity to build an underlying social graph of unique data and then to self-cannibalize by letting other platforms draw on it: the real financial opportunity for every platform, in other words, is to become a protocol that others build on top of.\n\nAnd second—at least in theory, if not always practice—the platforms are not much greater than the sum of their users.

Evolution of The Passion Economy\n\nFor new consumer startups targeting young people, one of the most popular marketing strategies is an on-campus student ambassador program. Household names like Tinder, Bumble, and Red Bull leveraged these programs successfully in the early days (and still today) to grow their brands across the country, and today’s generation of startups continue to build on this playbook. When done right, college ambassador programs are a low cost way to acquire users, generate buzz, and kickstart the network effects that lead to massive growth and adoption.\n\nIn fact, I myself was an entrepreneur in college who tried using an ambassador program on campus as our primary go-to-market (GTM) strategy for my startup, Hang . While Hang ultimately failed (in part due to launching in the middle of the pandemic), I learned a lot of lessons along the way on what works for a college ambassador program – and what doesn’t.\n\nWhen I joined a16z as part of the consumer go-to-market team, I got a lot of questions from startups and brands about how to launch and grow a successful college ambassador program, so I started talking with the campus directors and leads for other ambassador programs. Based on my own experience building Hang and research with both established brands like Bumble, Grubhub and Discord and startups like Fizz and Sidechat, here is a beginner’s guide on college ambassador programs for consumer startups. I’ll cover the what and why, when to launch a college ambassador program, how to get started and metrics for success, incentive structures, and more.\n\nA college ambassador program enlists influential students on a college campus to promote your brand and product to their peers. Ambassador programs are an excellent way to use a college campus to kickstart network effects within a group of like-minded target users with potentially lower costs than other strategies like digital advertising. Indeed, college campuses are natural environments for developing, testing, and growing consumer products.\n\nA college ambassador program is ultimately, though, a user acquisition strategy that takes advantage of this consumer behavior petri dish. Brand activation strategies used by these ambassadors can catalyze word of mouth (WOM) sharing on campus, leading the product to find its users. Other benefits of college ambassador programs include brand exposure (an ambassador’s core objective is to show off the brand to their peers through both digital and physical activations) and lowering customer acquisition costs (CAC) over the long run.\n\nWhile many kinds of startups could possibly leverage a college ambassador program, these three types are particularly well-suited to the dynamics of college campuses:\n\nare vital to the rapid growth of a new social platform, and an ambassador program is a great catalyst, particularly when targeting all of the specific social groups on a campus. While it didn’t leverage a college ambassador program, Facebook famously started by targeting college students. More recent examples include BeReal,\n\nEcommerce startups: Ambassadors can distribute affiliate codes and post on their social channels about your products. And with the rise of\n\n, ambassadors can even be sellers themselves. Though not exclusively for college students, the\n\nprogram is a great example of using an ambassador program to distribute affiliate codes. Another example is\n\nAn ambassador program is a great way to engage students and leverage these dynamics to grow brand awareness of your product – IF you have shown there is a need and desire for what you are building within a defined target audience.\n\nA critical point to recognize is that if you don’t yet have product-market fit within your target demographic (especially if it’s college-age students), an ambassador program is not likely to drive retention and long-term usage. Instead, it is more likely to drive a lot of initial new users who then churn out of the product because it doesn’t yet meet their needs – burning through a lot of your core audience and making it harder to win them over later.\n\nThere is no marketing strategy that will fix a product that its core audience won’t use! Instead, leverage a smaller, tight group of college students in different micro groups to test your product and give you insightful feedback on your beta before jumping into a wider, more planned ambassador launch.\n\nOne way to know you’re ready to launch a college ambassador program is after hitting key retention benchmarks. Before leveraging growth channels and bringing their product to a college campus, Sean Rad, cofounder of Tinder, said in an interview in 2014 that within a week of launching Tinder with a couple hundred of users, they had a 99.5% daily retention rate. From there, they took the product to college campuses to further experiment. Of course, many successful products will never have a 99.5% daily retention rate, but it’s important to have a clear sense of what a good retention rate is for your product.\n\nSome key questions to ask yourself before you decide to plan and execute on a college ambassador program:\n\nDo I have a group of beta users that are\n\nusing my product? Are my user retention numbers showing that this is the case?\n\nIs my product receiving positive feedback on the user experience and interface?\n\nDo our core targeted demographics align with a college campus?\n\nDo we have the technical team/infrastructure to make fixes on the product as the user base expands?\n\nYour business is ready to take in an influx of new users that it’s likely to retain, and you’re ready to set up your program. The three questions to ask next are: which campus do you start on; what are your goals; and what are the characteristics for your initial set of ambassadors.\n\nDifferent products are better suited for different types of college campuses. If you are a student entrepreneur, I recommend you focus on your own campus, as you know the landscape better than anyone.\n\nKey Questions to Ask Yourself When Choosing a Campus\n\nHow are social groups on campus perceived? In particular, are there Greek Life organizations in good standing at the school?\n\nHow do the particular seasons affect the social environment? Should I plan my launch around a particular time of the year?\n\nWhat are the largest social gatherings on campus? How can my ambassadors partner with those events?\n\nEvery school has a main event during the year that every student gathers to celebrate/or attend. Whether it’s a welcome week, spring week, or charity gathering, students are sure to be social during this time.\n\nExample: In Boston every year, the Beanpot hockey tournament draws students from the area to come and watch their schools compete (BU, Northeastern, Boston College, Harvard). At an event like this, an ambassador activation could be used to not only further engage Boston University students, but also to introduce your startup to the other competing schools, as well.\n\nOne strategy is to concentrate on infiltrating one particular school in a city with multiple schools (think Boston, Washington D.C, LA). Think of it as an ambassador program beta test: observe what works and what doesn’t on one campus before expanding. Each school may have a slightly different playbook due to varying social dynamics. Be willing to adapt your strategy as your program expands. Your ambassadors are sure to have friends in similar social groups at other schools; this is an excellent way to get personal referrals to grow your business!\n\nWhile COVID-19 and school restrictions contributed to the digitization of many students’ experience over the last few years, the current landscape has allowed for schools to reopen. Be sure to be up to date on what is allowed and not on certain campuses, as going against school restrictions can put your brand and ambassadors at risk.\n\nWhen evaluating what goals you would like to set for your ambassador program to achieve, first understand the core metrics of your product and which of those an ambassador program is most likely to move. Examples include:\n\nBrand engagement (for social channels in particular: number of comments, likes, shares)\n\n(often through an increase in “direct” or non-attributed new users)\n\nFor these last two, you may not be able to directly attribute them, depending on the kind of activations you’re doing, but you can still observe a correlated uptick in downloads or reduction in CAC when you have activations in progress with your campus ambassadors. Evaluate these metrics on a weekly and monthly basis, as well as on the time structure of the school (e.g. quarters, trimesters, semesters, etc).\n\nWhile those lagging metrics are critical for your business success, there are also leading metrics to measure the success of an ambassador program more directly and immediately. Depending on your tactics, here are some common metrics to see if the program is working:\n\nIncreased social following for your brand\n\nAre students who still have time left in school continuing as an ambassador? More retention = higher ambassador satisfaction.\n\nFind what percentage of non-graduating students return as ambassadors or refer a new hire.\n\nNot all college students will be the right fit to be an ambassador. Here are some key questions to ask yourself before recruiting your first ambassadors:\n\nWhat are the characteristics of my ideal user? And who is most likely\n\nto be able to connect with that audience? (e.g. if you were building a tutoring product, your ideal user will be someone who prioritizes school. What type of on campus ambassador is someone who prioritizes school likely to listen to? Someone who is consistently on the dean’s list)\n\nWho is perceived as trusted by their peers?\n\nDo our possible ambassadors have a strong online presence (and followers who are also ideal users)?\n\nOnce you’re ready to begin recruiting, your first hire will be your Campus Lead Ambassador. Your lead ambassador should know the ins and outs on campus and should be responsible for helping you connect with the groups who have the most influence on campus. This person will be your primary point of contact for all activities on campus, but should still be a student.\n\nQualities to look for in your campus lead and ambassadors:\n\nHave you held leadership roles in your on campus organization?\n\nHow would you describe your digital presence?\n\nWhat would you do on campus to grow awareness of our product?\n\nWork with your lead ambassador on campus on the initial hiring plan. The number of ambassadors you hire will depend on how large the school is and how many major groups of influence there are to cover who are specific likely users of your product.\n\nUnderstanding the ways in which different groups connect is tribal knowledge to students on campus. You do not need an ambassador in every major group on campus, but your ambassadors need to have a way to get in touch with each. One campus lead, with two to three ambassadors, likely gives you enough touch points to get to all the student groups you need to get started. While you can post job descriptions or application pages for the roles, personal referrals are the best way to get to the right people.\n\nExamples of groups on college campuses that could be targeted for an ambassador program:\n\nEvery college campus has an abundance of hyper-targeted clubs of passionate followers. For example, Discord targeted Computer Science and Gaming clubs to get them on board.\n\nGreek Life organizations have been the one of the most popular places for ambassador programs to be launched. The advantage of most fraternities and sororities is that the majority all live together in a central location, meaning communication and interaction is frequent. Additionally, fraternities and sororities are constantly socializing with each other. This network has the social infrastructure in place to spread the word on a product.\n\nDepending on the school, athletes have a tremendous amount of influence on campus, but up until 2021, they were unable to get paid. Now due to NCAA changes in their regulations, athletes can be compensated and could be targeted as paid college ambassadors. Reminder: These athletes can have strong influence, but understand they already have a full time job as a student-athlete and are less likely to have time to spare.\n\nIf you’re not currently a student, in order to find these organizations, look for your school’s student activities office page online. Almost every school will have a full directory of student organizations (including Greek Life) and the main point of contact (for example, check out USC’s page ). Many also will link to their social pages, which can be a more reliable way to get in touch.\n\nWhile you might be focused on what college ambassadors can do for your product, it’s more important that you think about it from their perspective: what do they get from being your ambassador? Some common incentives for ambassadors include:\n\nBrand affiliation: First and foremost, an ambassador that loves your product and genuinely wants to share it with their friends is the ideal! You want your ambassadors to feel proud to be promoting your product to their audience because the affinity provides them with social capital. An ex-Discord Ambassador shared that he felt incentivized to bring more students on the platform purely because of how much he loved Discord and that more people needed to enjoy the benefits.\n\nResume-building: College campuses are filled with fierce competition for top jobs once graduating. While most students focus on just getting the best internship for that particular summer, working as a brand ambassador for a hot startup can be a unique and valuable experience that can help them land a coveted internship or job later.\n\nAccess to benefits: Give your ambassadors access to early versions of the product to make them feel more connected through exclusive access. If you are building an ecommerce startup, give your ambassadors free/discounted products. If you’re building a social app, perhaps they get a few more invites to hand out than the average user or the ability to try a new feature before anyone else.\n\nFor example, ecommerce startup Curtsy advertised in their job description: “All members get 20% off everything on Curtsy (excluding our weekly sale brand or category) and welcome credit to use on our site. Winners of competitions receive gift cards. You’ll also get a personalized unique referral code to share with your friends \u0026 community!”\n\nCommunity building/social or professional networking: Most college students aren’t taught how to build a professional network, and your college ambassador program can be another affiliation group that helps them build connections for life after college. Work to create a strong sense of community, bringing your ambassadors together in social settings. The dating platform Bumble holds ex-ambassador events even after they graduate from the school. Given most college ambassadors won’t convert to full time employees after graduation, Bumble created a post-grad community where there are networking events, wellness retreats, and unique job opportunities.\n\nFizz, a debit card for students that helps build credit, hosts ambassadors for a “quarterly event with investors, founders, personal finance experts \u0026 more”.\n\nEarning money: If you are paying your ambassadors (which is not a requirement), there are a variety of pay structures that have been successful for established brands. The common thread between them all is carefully keeping track of the tasks completed.\n\nPay by task completed: assign weekly tasks and pay your ambassadors after photo proof of completion (Bumble)\n\nLength: Keep your ambassador programs to a semester/quarters length to make sure that the ambassadors you have are consistently engaged and do not simply fade out. Allow them to reapply and encourage them to do so. A major problem ambassador programs face is the constant churn of students to busy schedules or graduation. Leverage your best graduating ambassadors to help find their own replacements. In my experience, many who joined a college ambassador program were direct referrals from folks already at the company.\n\nAsk for feedback from your ambassadors, the ones who leave and the ones who come back. How could their experience have been better? Would they have wanted more direction or more autonomy? How could they have been better incentivized?\n\nTraining: The most important component to training your ambassadors is making sure they are able to clearly communicate what your product does. If your ambassadors are unable to speak clearly on your value proposition, the mission and purpose will get lost in translation.\n\nHold Zoom meetings with your ambassadors to practice until they can clearly articulate. Your ambassadors will get asked many questions and are expected by consumers to know the answers. Put another way, think of the questions that you as a founder are constantly asked to clarify – your ambassadors will get the same ones! Have an active group messaging thread (Slack, Discord, Whatsapp, iMessage, etc) so your ambassadors always have an open line to ask questions.\n\nCreate a playbook for your ambassadors to refer to. Playbooks provide an easy and clear way for your ambassadors to understand their responsibilities, practice the value proposition, and answer FAQ’s. Leverage your best ambassadors to help refine your playbook once you begin to launch at other schools.\n\nCommunicate your metrics/expectations clearly to your ambassadors and hold weekly syncs to make sure they are on track. Hold your ambassadors accountable to these metrics!\n\nBudget: How much overall spend you allocate toward your ambassador program depends on what you think the best marketing channel for your business may be. If your business is make-or-break on college student acquisition, lean more heavily into funding the ambassador program vs other marketing channels.\n\nWithin your ambassador program budget, different activation strategies have different costs. If the ultimate goal is to spur word of mouth, be creative with lower budget marketing options that get students talking about your product.\n\nAnother framework for setting your college ambassador program budget is to benchmark it against other paid acquisition costs and your overall CAC. Say you’re an ecommerce startup and calculate your CAC to be $75. By having college ambassadors hand out flyers with credit toward the product for $50, you could acquire users more cheaply, assuming the costs of the credit, your ambassador’s time, and printing out the flyers all comes under $75.\n\nSo what do college ambassadors actually do to get the word out about your brand? I like to bucket them in three different ways, with each having more distinct advantages depending on your budget and the type of company you’re building. Prioritize what you feel is best for your product.\n\nFor all of these activation categories, it is important to “Know Thy Campus”, and listen to the tribal knowledge of your ambassadors. Encourage your ambassadors to be creative and think outside the box of how they can connect/get the attention of students. It could be something as simple as handing out pizza slices from the best pie shop everyone raves about, encouraging debate between the best sandwich places on campus on Twitter, or raffling off VIP concert tickets when a major artist comes into town. Including great food or free drinks with brand activations is always a strong way to engage college students!\n\nSocial posts reach college campuses and student groups at scale, given posts are easily shared and engaged with. This is also the most budget-friendly option. Be sensitive to the fact that digital identities are important to college students, and suggesting too many posts on social media can be counterproductive (once a month is a good target). Make sure to have a full-time team member responsible for the brand’s social media account, so when followers of your ambassador come to your page, they see more relevant content and stay.\n\nEx: Grubhub’s “ Campus Tastemakers ” program gives ambassadors rewards for posting content of their orders from restaurants around campus.\n\nBest for: new social platforms, larger budget\n\nSponsoring events are generally a more expensive ambassador activation but are great for creating a fun environment to engage potential users. Events are prone to pumping up inorganic downloads (students who download the app purely for “free entry/drink”) but still they can still create brand recognition. To drive attendees, promote competitions between organizations so that whoever brings in the most downloads/sales gets a reward.\n\nFor example, Bumble gave their ambassadors a budget to organize a bar event to boost downloads. Everyone who attended the event first had to show the person at the door that they had downloaded the app and made an account. Given that some people had already downloaded the app, the team measured success by how many drink tickets they had handed out at the door. While some people downloaded the app purely to get into an event with their friends, if someone who attended the event eventually wanted to use a dating app, they had had a Bumble experience and it was ready on their phone.\n\nBest for: all!\n\n“In real life” (IRL) on-campus activations are a great way to have a direct, personal connection with the audience you are trying to reach without the formality of a large event. Basically, place your ambassadors in a popular location where students are going to be anyways and have an excuse for your ambassadors to speak with their peers. For example, social platform, Sidechat , had tables around campus handing out cookies for everyone that downloaded the app. You are able to speak directly with potential customers, get on the spot feedback, and answer any questions they may have.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an ambassador program and an influencer program?\n\nWhile they share a lot of common tactics, ambassador and influencer programs ultimately have different playbooks and different goals. Isa Lampson, former Bumble ambassador and ambassador lead for Nate describes it this way: . Ambassador programs go straight to a defined, targeted audience, so that you know your marketing efforts are reaching the right folks. Influencer content is being spread to a much broader and less specific audience. With an influencer marketing strategy, she noted, your goal needs to be specific in order to see the value, given how expensive they can be.\n\nI don’t have the budget to pay my ambassadors. Can I still operate an ambassador program?\n\nYes! While many programs offer direct financial incentives to individual ambassadors, students can be motivated by a variety of factors. Given these students won’t be making money, it is then critical to design the program in a way that emphasizes the benefits of what they are getting out of the program.\n\nI’m not sure when exactly my product is going to be ready. Should I still plan my program?\n\nIt’s always good to be planning ahead and taking notes on what kinds of strategies and tactics might work in your circumstance, but it’s better to wait to launch an ambassador program vs go too early.\n\nIn particular, if you’re considering launching your product with an ambassador program, remember: launch dates are hard to manage in the best of circumstances, and it becomes even more complicated when you have a set of college ambassadors waiting on you at the same time.\n\nSet reasonable expectations for your ambassadors and users, and make sure to sync with your tech team consistently so that launch dates are not pushed back after planning infrastructure was put into place. Slipping on your launch date multiple times can damage your reputation and waste a hype cycle of a pre-launch product. Make sure the product can handle scale when users join!\n\nThese guidelines are meant to help founders get started with a basic framework for how to structure a college ambassador program. But the best college ambassador programs are the ones that get creative; there is not one set playbook a startup has to follow to be successful!\n\nThank you to Isabella Lampson, Maya Malde, Shaina Zafar and Noorie Dhingra, Sean Doherty, and Thomas Yee for sharing their valued experience with me for this guide!\n\nJacob Westphal is a partner on the consumer go-to-market team at a16z.

process of going from “I don’t think I have anything to write about, and it takes so long” to “I’m regularly writing about interesting topics.”\n\nThere’s lots to say about this journey, but I discovered one mental model that I really like. I think in that process of growth, there are three steps. In each step, your bottleneck for how much you write, and how efficiently you write, changes.\n\nIn response to this mental model, a friend asked me where they thought I was today. I think I’m somewhere between stages 2 and 3 – I feel quite comfortable turning my ideas into writing, and with some revision and friends' feedback, I can usually produce writing that accurately communicates my ideas.\n\nRegardless of where you feel you are, there’s only one way to keep improving.

I’m trying to write shorter pieces more frequently. welcome new readers to my little space on the internet (my art, words, and thoughts).\n\nLife is a pretty delicious dream if you know what you want out of it. Brian Eno once said: for the world to be interesting, you have to be manipulating it all the time. This is true. If you know which strings to pull, whose shit to shovel, which rules to break, the world can absolutely be fine-tuned to what you want it to be.\n\nI live by this mantra: you can have everything you want, you just can’t have it all at once – you can have love and desire and youth and wisdom and education and career and puppies and children and indulgence and control. Humans are built to want more than we can handle. To experience pleasure in small amounts and then seek it excessively. Huxley: I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin. I know you want to consume everything, put your greedy little hands on anything you can touch, open your mouth wide, consume it whole. You want to pour something essential of your soul into the world, leave a legacy. You want to run right into the warm, gooey center of love and clasp your arms tightly around it, but external love will not fix you because the love you’re looking for is right there inside of you already. You just have to dig a little deeper.\n\nYou crave everything at once, and see life as one big feast. You want both discipline and freedom, both stability and novelty. But sometimes you need to learn one before the other. You need to see life more as a dance, one that ebbs and flows. Henry Miller: The art of living is based on rhythm. By acceptance of all aspects of life, good and bad, right and wrong, yours and mine, the static, defensive life, which is what most people are cursed with, is converted into a dance, ‘the dance of life,’ metamorphosis. (Acceptance) is the first thing any one has to learn in order to live. It is extremely difficult, because it means surrender, full surrender.\n\nLearn how to wait for things. Accept that you can’t have everything at once. Have patience and a little more self-trust. Surrender yourself to this big, glorious, dream-filled dance we call life. Everything exists on your timeline – you just can’t see it quite yet.\n\nKokoro is well understood in Japanese, but difficult to explain in English, says Yoshikawa Sakiko, director of Kyoto University’s Kokoro Research Center. Conceptually, it unites the notions of heart, mind, and spirit: It sees these three elements as being indivisible from one other. “For example if we say, ‘She has a good kokoro,’ it means heart and spirit and soul and mind all together.”\n\nIn the process of thinking through making a new painting in the style of these ones I made a few years ago, so I went to an acrylic store and picked up some new paints, brushes, and a new stretched canvas. Very excited to paint again. I am going to be painting a new colorful bunny-human.\n\n@sun_girlxo’s newsletter on ‘grief for the living’\n\nI believe this specific instance is when we experience this unique grief for the living—when the contradictions are too overwhelming for us to accept or peacefully incorporate into the image we’ve created of someone, making us feel like we’re stuck\n\nWe experience this grief when something happens that requires a complete reassessment of the person in question; when the only way to understand and accept who they are now is to stop clinging on to our image of who they used to be. Physically, the person is the same—psychologically, they might as well be a stranger.\n\ngrieving someone who is still alive\n\nGrief is a complex emotion to navigate, but there is some comfort in the fact that it is inevitable. We will all one day have to mourn the death of a loved one, and others will do the same for us. But what happens when the person we are mourning is still very much alive—perhaps even still in our lives…\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Serendipity births unexpected opportunities which fuel progress and push us in fruitful directions. By maximizing serendipity, you’ll accelerate your progress.\n\nSerendipity is a skill, which means it can be learned .\n\nWriting is the best kind of networking.\n\nBy making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity. Call on your vehicle when you want to manufacture serendipity, and you need some activation energy.\n\nMy vehicle is the North Star Podcast.\n\nLess than three months after starting the North Star Podcast, I was introduced to Neil deGrasse Tyson , arguably the most famous scientist in the world. All I did was ask for a previous podcast guest to introduce me to one of his friends. Turns out, Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of his best friends.\n\nIf you publish content (blogs, podcasts, videos, etc.) regularly, people will discover you and initiate unexpected opportunities. They’ll open doors you didn’t even know existed.\n\nMaintain a website so people can find your bio, share your work, and describe you in a favorable light. Once your website is live, publish content to encourage people to visit your website, advertise your skills and hype you up.\n\nRelationships built on trust, joy and mutual respect are the foundation of serendipity.\n\nI rarely go to conferences or traditional networking events. Doing so feels like a waste of energy, like trying to stand on your tiptoes at a parade.\n\nIn my experience , the best networking happens indirectly. Meet people on the basketball court, in the gym, or at a meal instead of going to a networking event.\n\nHost intimate events. I host a group in New York called Things We’ve Never Done Before. It’s a collection of passionate, hyper-curious individuals. Every now and then, we meet up for a day of fun, exercise and adventure.¹\n\nWhen you connect other people, tons of value will eventually flow back to you. Introduce your friends to each other. Opportunities are everywhere: Say yes to pick-up basketball, a spontaneous afternoon run, or a trip to the museum.\n\nThe healthier you are, the more activities you can attend.\n\nPeople want to be with healthy people.\n\nEat healthy food, get enough sleep, and break a sweat every day. It’ll boost your mood and fuel your curiosity.\n\nPeople are drawn to people who are energetic and engaged . Healthy people are much more likely to cultivate these traits and enjoy a diverse lifestyle.\n\nPeople who sweat together stay together.\n\nWorking out with a friend is social and productive. Turns out, it’s also one of the best ways to spark, maintain, and nurture a relationship.\n\nWork on many things at the same time. Surround yourself with eclectic people. Skip the standard destinations and travel to obscure places instead.\n\nCross-pollinate ideas from different industries, disciplines, and places. Surround yourself with a diversity of people and develop a variety of skills. The space between ideas will give you a fresh perspective that you can use to problem solve and come up with new ideas.\n\nBecause of your unique set of skills, lucrative deals will flow through you and other people will open doors for you. They’ll sell your abilities and hype you up, leading to serendipitous encounters.\n\nThis advice comes from Jim Watson, who’s famous for co-discovering DNA.\n\nOn the North Star Podcast , Josh Wolfe said this was the best advice he’s ever received.\n\n“Avoid Boring People.” Three words, two meanings. The trope is a reminder to (1) stay away from people who aren’t interesting and (2) to be interesting and avoid boring people when you’re speaking with them.\n\nBuild conversational momentum by asking questions, staying engaged, and talking about the other person’s interests.²\n\nWhether you’re sitting on an airplane, relaxing in a coffee shop, or walking through a hotel, you’ll be able to speak with anybody, anywhere.\n\nWhenever I’m in a city and I need to use the bathroom, I walk into a fancy hotel.\n\nFancy hotels always have nice bathrooms. And if you’re dressed well and walk confidently, you won’t be hassled for using the bathroom.\n\nThe world is becoming more casual. But if you dress too casually, it looks sloppy and careless.\n\nWhen you want to cultivate serendipity, stick to the “Hotel Bathroom” dress code. Always dress well enough to walk into a bathroom at a hotel you’re not staying at and get away with it.\n\nIf you remember the “Hotel Bathroom Principle” you’ll always look sharp enough to capitalize on a serendipitous encounter.\n\nLucky people move with life, not against it.\n\nThey swim with the current in a wide, ever-expanding river. By doing so, they maximize their surface area of serendipity.\n\nLucky people bathe in the reverie of adventure. They surround themselves with people who motivate and inspire them. People who maximize serendipity balance the humility of not knowing where their next big break will come from with the arrogance of knowing that it will come from somewhere.³\n\nMove to a city. Pursue dynamic environments.⁴ Talk to people. Speak with passion and enthusiasm. Write online . Be curious. Ask about the other person, and when you do, listen intently.\n\nAmbient music is gentle and repetitive. It’s soothing and generates a sense of calmness. It plays in the background, and when you want to listen to it, all you need to do is shift your attention.\n\nRelationships are like ambient music. Staying in touch with people isn’t about being loud and aggressive. It’s about subtle, regular connection.\n\nStay top of mind with the people who matter most to you.\n\nThis is why I started a weekly email newsletter. Every Monday, I send out an email with nuggets about what I’m doing, learning, and thinking about. I want to make it easy for people to know how they can help me .\n\nCall people on their birthday. When you think of a funny memory with a friend, text your friend about it. If you watch a video they’ll like, forward it to them.\n\nReach out to people you haven’t spoken to recently. When you do, try to have a reason for doing so. It’ll make the conversation much more fun.\n\nIf Facebook connects you with people from your past, Twitter connects you with people in your future.\n\nIt’s an interest-based social network, where geography barely matters. On Twitter, you can meet people you’d never be able to meet in real-life.\n\nTweet about what interests you. Watch what people engage with and tweet more of it, as long as it helps you earn credibility.\n\nFollow like-minded people. Send generous, thoughtful replies. Tweet so the people you admire most will follow you.\n\nOnce they do, send them a direct message.\n\nSometimes, it helps to have a little nudge — some activation energy.\n\nTalk to your crush. Send that email . Dish a compliment. The upside is limitless; the downside is just a sprinkle of embarrassment.\n\nFor example, I’m ruthless about following up with people.⁵ I set strict reminders for myself and I always follow-through.\n\nTell the world what you want. Advertise your goals by painting a picture of your ideal future.\n\nEvery now and then, I send out an update to my entire network. In it, I share highlights, goals, and open up about my challenges. Here’s my most recent personal update.\n\nPeople love to help other people when the framing is right.\n\nParadoxically, big goals are sometimes easier to achieve than small ones. Big goals energize everybody — they’ll energize you and everybody around you. By communicating clear, ambitious goals, you’ll galvanize support and attention.⁶\n\nWhen you ask for favors, follow these three guidelines: (1) be specific and precise, (2) tell the other person why you’re asking for their help, and (3) after they’ve helped you, follow up with them thank them or provide an update.\n\nAsking for help is an art, not a science.⁷\n\nIf you remember one thing, remember this: Make it easy for people to help you.\n\nNetworking events are over-rated: As a general rule, the people you want to meet don’t go to networking events. Instead, I recommend small invite-only gatherings, parties adjacent to prestigious conferences, and casual events like pick-up basketball.\n\nDon’t “Pick Somebody’s Brain”: Help them instead. Whenever I want to meet somebody, I ask to interview them. Doing so makes the time much more productive for the other person. I did this in as an intern in college and I do it now.\n\nNote: If you’d like to receive future posts by email, subscribe to my “Monday Musings” newsletter.\n\n¹ Here are some ideas for you: host a brunch, invite people over for board games and drinks, or start an interview series.\n\n² Know enough about enough so you can talk to anybody, from artists to scientists to athletes. This will help you spark up engaging conversations with people you’ve never met before.\n\n³ While writing this post, I ran into a friend at lunch, and now, we’re recording a podcast together.\n\n⁴ Eugene Wei , a previous North Star podcast guest, has had a hugely successful career. When I asked him what he looks for, he said he looks for a giant wave. Then the gets on it, and trusts that the wave will spit him out somewhere in the right direction.\n\nI’ve been writing on Twitter for years. In college, something I wrote was discovered by Jason Stein, the founder of Cycle Media. After reading my tweets, he sent me a direct message and asked me to work for him. That’s how I ended up in New York.\n\nIn December 2016, I attended a live recording of the Tim Ferriss Podcast. There, I was blown away by the intelligence and creativity of Adam Robinson, who was being interviewed. I sent him an email, asked him to come on the podcast, and now, he’s a mentor to me.\n\nAt a mentor’s birthday party a couple months ago, I spoke briefly with one of his colleagues. I didn’t know it at the time, but he co-founded the world’s largest YouTube Channel and worked with some of the biggest names in the music industry. Even though we only spoke for 5 minutes at the party, I asked for his phone number and scheduled a time for dinner. We ended up spending 10 hours together. I’m lucky to call him a friend now.\n\n⁶ Your request should be broad, but not too broad. Narrow, but not too narrow.\n\nToo broad and somebody won’t know how to help you. Too narrow and you might miss an unexpected opportunity.\n\n⁷ Every industry has different ways of cultivating serendipity. In fashion, people cultivate serendipity by posting Instagrams in trendy garments. In cryptocurrencies, serendipity emerges through Telegrams and dinner events. This is why serendipity is a mindset. The optimal strategy varies from person to person, depending on their specific circumstances.\n\nI’m in San Sebastián, Spain, but I could really be anywhere. I’ve flown halfway across the world, but from inside this coffee shop, I can’t tell what country I’m in.\n\nWe don’t talk enough about friendship.\n\nChoosing to learn in public is the best career decision I’ve ever made.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, ambition matters more than financial success.\n\n“Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions.” – Marcus Aurelius\n\nWrite of Passage teaches a step-by-step method for publishing quality content.

Human-Built World Is Not Built For Humans","link":"https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/the-human-built-world-is-not-built?s=r","content":"“I believe that a desirable future depends on our deliberately choosing a life of action over a life of consumption, on our engendering a life style which will enable us to be spontaneous, independent, yet related to each other, rather than maintaining a life style which only allows us to make and unmake, produce and consume—a style of life which is merely a way station on the road to the depletion and pollution of the environment.”\n\nWelcome to the Convivial Society, a newsletter about technology and culture. It’s been a while since the last installment. I worked on an essay for some time, but ultimately it did not come together quite the way I had hoped. Instead, I’m going to take three ideas in that unwieldy draft and spin them out as a series of relatively brief reflections that I’ll send out in the coming days. This is the first. Also, I’m including some reading recommendations with each of these. I hope you find them helpful.\n\nA few days ago, a story was circulating about how the infrastructure bill, which was recently passed by the House of Representatives, included funding for research on beacons to be worn by cyclists and pedestrians to make them legible to autonomous vehicles. A story in Forbes noted that the bill “formalizes the acceptance of so-called ‘vehicle to everything’ (V2X) technology that, on the face of it, promises enhanced safety on the roads for pedestrians and cyclists.”\n\nEach time I’ve read something about how we will all have to wear sensors to survive the envisioned future transportation environment, a particular paragraph from Illich’s Deschooling Society has come to mind: “Contemporary man,” Illich wrote, “attempts to create the world in his image, to build a totally man-made environment, and then discovers that he can do so only on the condition of constantly remaking himself to fit it.”\n\nIllich wrote these words in the early 1970s, long before beacons to keep cyclists and pedestrians safe from autonomous vehicles would become a policy priority. But the pattern was already evident. In the same essay, Illich told the following anecdote:\n\nI know a Mexican village through which not more than a dozen cars drive each day. A Mexican was playing dominoes on the new hard-surface road in front of his house — where he had probably played and sat since his youth. A car sped through and killed him. The tourist who reported the event to me was deeply upset, and yet he said: “The man had it coming to him.”\n\nThe assumption in the tourist’s statement is clear and brutal: it is the responsibility of humans to adapt to their technical milieu. For the sake of a development he likely neither needed or desired, this man’s environment was transformed so as to render it hostile to him, but it is somehow his fault for failing to promptly adapt himself to the new reality. As Illich notes, there’s not even an air of the tragic in the tourist’s claim. One can imagine some not-too-distant future when a cyclist is struck and killed by an autonomous vehicle and an observer declares, “Well, she wasn’t even wearing her beacon, so she had it coming to her.”\n\nAs I thought about Illich’s anecdote, my own parental anxiety to convey to my children the importance of minding the cars around them at all times appeared in a new light. When one remembers that it has not always been necessary to carefully train a child, with ritualistic precision, just so that they can walk about without fear of mortal injury, then the whole thing takes on a rather absurd and malicious character.\n\nOnce you see this dynamic in one set of circumstances, you start to see it again and again. In innumerable ways we bend ourselves to fit the pattern of a techno-economic order that exists for its own sake and not for ours. As another example, consider Illich’s observations in 2000 about what is required of those who would pursue a successful career:\n\nModern citizens who want to pursue a successful career face a situation that is without clear boundaries or limits, and this prevents them from recognizing an alternative to their self-directed ‘lifelong learning and decision-making.’ Their comings and goings, their progress and well-being, their flourishing and ruination depend on their adaptation to diverse systems. In particular, they have to learn to function and compete in symbiosis with current economic conditions. A tolerant acceptance of these conditions is no longer enough. One has to learn to identify with them. In the mills of the new economy, where positioning is all, the grit is supposed to grind itself so fine that it becomes grease for the gears.\n\nOr consider Shannon Mattern’s observation that “our phones seem to be contrived for circadian contradiction.” A reminder that our own technologically induced patterns of restlessness can be profoundly unhealthy . Our phones, after all, function as an interface between us and a vast network of communication and commerce: in practice, do they principally serve our interests or those of the network?\n\nAs the ways that we are schooled for life in a system that in significant ways runs counter to our own interests and well-being become more apparent, then Illich’s more radical claims begin to sound plausible if not altogether sensible.\n\nIn Tools for Conviviality, for example, we encounter this stark summation of Illich’s view of industrial society:\n\nIncreasing manipulation of man becomes necessary to overcome the resistance of his vital equilibrium to the dynamic of growing industries; it takes the form of educational, medical, and administrative therapies. Education turns out competitive consumers; medicine keeps them alive in the engineered environment they have come to require; bureaucracy reflects the necessity of exercising social control over people to do meaningless work. The parallel increase in the cost of the defense of new levels of privilege through military, police, and insurance measures reflects the fact that in a consumer society there are inevitably two kinds of slaves: the prisoners of addiction and the prisoners of envy.\n\nMaybe this comes off as rather extreme. After all, Illich is arguing that the modern world, circa 1974 at least, is fundamentally hostile to human well-being and that some of its most vaunted institutions were basically coping and conditioning mechanisms.\n\nJacques Ellul, with passing reference to learning how to navigate street traffic, argues similarly:\n\n“At the same time, one should not forget the fact that human beings are themselves already modified by the technical phenomenon […] Their whole education is oriented toward adaptation to the conditions of technique (learning how to cross streets at traffic lights) and their instruction is destined to prepare them for entrance into some technical employment. Human beings are psychologically modified by consumption, by technical work, by news, by television, by leisure activities (currently, the proliferation of computer games), etc., all of which are techniques. In other words, it must not be forgotten that it is this very humanity which has been pre-adapted to and modified by technique that is supposed to master and reorient technique. It is obvious that this will not be able to be done with any independence.”\n\nBut this is why I read writers like Illich and Ellul, and why I encourage others to do the same: for the sake of a thoroughgoing critique that will make me think more deeply, and uncomfortably, about our situation and my own acquiescence and complicity. I find that my vision tends to be too narrowly focused on surface-level symptoms. And it is too easy to take refuge in the thought that a few tweaks here and a little regulation there will make all things well, or at least significantly better. Meanwhile, nothing quite changes. Then along comes someone like Illich or Ellul claiming that maybe the whole modern techno-social order, whatever its relative merits, is broken and malignant. That the roots of our problems run much deeper than we had assumed. That we are, in truth, doing it all wrong and should revisit some of our most fundamental assumptions. You may not, in the end, agree with their conclusions, but seriously considering their perspectives should at least help us to ask better, more fundamental questions about the human-built world, or, perhaps more importantly, about the beliefs, values, and interests that shape it.\n\nWhat Illich and Ellul would have us consider is that the human-built world is not, in fact, built for humans. And, of course, this is to say nothing of what the human-built world has meant for the non-human world. What’s more, it may be paradoxically the case that the human-built world will prove finally inhospitable to human beings precisely to the degree that it was built for humans without regard for humanity’s continuity with the other animals and the world we inhabit together.\n\n“Be THERE Now” by Livia Foldes: “This dream [of telepresence] insists that technology will let (some of) us have it both ways: embodiment without proximity, knowledge without danger, pleasure without risk, and power without exposure. And it has been remarkably resilient, used to redefine everything from the nature of work, to the boundaries of warfare, to the contours of intimacy during a plague.”\n\n“The Body Is Not a Machine” by Nitin K. Ahuja: “Conventional clinical readers might be rolling their eyes by now, assuming they’ve made it this far. Fair enough. Interpretive liberties are a risky proposition in healthcare, particularly at a political moment when scientific authority is already under heavy scrutiny. Of late, however, I’ve become increasingly compelled by the patients whose symptoms I can’t ever quite explain. Their intuitions make sense to me lately, in spirit if not always in substance, despite often running counter to most of what I’ve learned since medical school. Broken bodies move inevitably through a broken world. More and more, I’m likewise troubled by what feels like deep pathology sitting just beyond the reach of my clinic.”\n\nBrad East offers a reading of Wendell Berry that contends with the criticisms leveled by George Scialabba: “The industrial economy is thus the paradigm, for Berry, of technocracy understood as the generic application of Thinking Big from nowhere to anywhere and everywhere. Such “thinking” is nothing of the kind: it is the abdication of thought, which properly takes shape in particular interactions between actual persons and the concrete objects and environments that make their lives possible—“our only world,” as he calls it. Technocracy is “machine thought.” Some presume the solution to the problems of technocracy must be more of the same, only the good variety rather than the bad. Berry demurs: technocracy as such is the errant mode of thinking and acting for which we need an alternative. It cannot save itself. It is what got us into this mess.”\n\nZachary Loeb supplies an excellent introduction to the work of Lewis Mumford. The title of Loeb’s essay, “The Magnificent Bribe,” is taken from this striking paragraph in Mumford’s “Authoritarian and Democratic Technics” : “The bargain we are being asked to ratify takes the form of a magnificent bribe. Under the democratic-authoritarian social contract, each member of the community may claim every material advantage, every intellectual and emotional stimulus he may desire, in quantities hardly available hitherto even for a restricted minority: food, housing, swift transportation, instantaneous communication, medical care, entertainment, education. But on one condition: that one must not merely ask for nothing that the system does not provide, but likewise agree to take everything offered, duly processed and fabricated, homogenized and equalized, in the precise quantities that the system, rather than the person, requires. Once one opts for the system no further choice remains. In a word, if one surrenders one’s life at source, authoritarian technics will give back as much of it as can be mechanically graded, quantitatively multiplied, collectively manipulated and magnified.”\n\nIn a conversation with Clive Thompson, philosopher Evan Selinger shows us “How To Recognize When Tech Is Leading Us Down a ‘Slippery Slope’ ” : Clive : But you think sometimes there really are technological slippery slopes — tech that pushes us in a bad direction really strongly. How can you tell when we’re facing a real slippery slope technology? What makes that technology have such power? Evan : You need to talk about affordances and incentives. What affordances does the technology have? And what incentives does it offer people?\n\nFrom 2015, Lee Vinsel offered his “95 Theses on Innovation.” Not sure if they were ever nailed to a door somewhere in Silicon Valley: 1. Innovation is the central ideology of our age. Its core assumption is that technological change is the key to both economic growth and quality of life. 49. The root of our problem is that we treat innovation as a basic value, like courage, love, charity, and diligence. In reality, innovation is simply the process by which new things enter wide circulation in the world. Innovation has nothing to say about whether these new things are beneficial or harmful. 95. The fall of innovation-speak will be a chance to reorient our society around values that actually matter. Will we seize this opportunity? Or will we allow corporate executives and other elites to seduce us with another wave of shiny, sparkling nonsense? The most radical thought is that there are principles beyond usefulness, beyond utility.\n\n— In a recent post, Marianne Bellotti raised a series of questions: “However, when it comes to the issue of making AI safe we’re left with the question: Who is the operator in the first place? Is the operator the machine learning engineer who builds and trains the model? How much experience does that person have? What baseline knowledge must all AI engineers prove mastery over? What are the relevant degrees or credentials?”\n\nThese in turn brought to mind an essay by Paul Goodman written in 1969, “Can Technology Be Humane” (paywalled, I’m afraid). In it, Goodman claimed that “Whether or not it draws on new scientific research technology is a branch of moral philosophy, not of science.” Goodman, in the paragraph that Bellotti’s questions brought to mind, also argued the following:\n\n“[…] technology must have its proper place on the faculty as a learned profession important in modern society, along with medicine, law, the humanities, and natural philosophy, learning from them and having something to teach them. As a moral philosopher, a technician should be able to criticize the programs given him to implement. As a professional in a community of learned professionals, a technologist must have a different kind of training and develop a different character than we see at present among technicians and engineers. He should know something of the social sciences, law, the fine arts, and medicine, as well as relevant natural sciences.”\n\n“Prudence is foresight, caution, utility. Thus it is up to the technologists, not to regulatory agencies of the government, to provide for safety and to think about remote effects. This is what Ralph Nader is saying and Rachel Carson used to ask. An important aspect of caution is flexibility, to avoid the pyramiding catastrophe that occurs when something goes wrong in interlocking technologies, as in urban power failures. Naturally, to take responsibility for such things often requires standing up to the front office and urban politicians, and technologists must organize themselves in order to have power to do it.”\n\nI recently contributed an essay to the latest issue of The Side View, “Surviving the Show: The New Asceticism of Ivan Illich.” I also did an enjoyable interview with Uri Bram of The Browser.

Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence? - Scientific American","link":"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence","content":"We are in the middle of a technological upheaval that will transform the way society is organized. We must make the right decisions now\n\nEditor’s Note: This article first appeared in Spektrum der Wissenschaft, Scientific American’s sister publication, as “Digitale Demokratie statt Datendiktatur.”\n\n“Enlightenment is man’s emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another.”\n\nThe digital revolution is in full swing. How will it change our world? The amount of data we produce doubles every year. In other words: in 2016 we produced as much data as in the entire history of humankind through 2015. Every minute we produce hundreds of thousands of Google searches and Facebook posts. These contain information that reveals how we think and feel. Soon, the things around us, possibly even our clothing, also will be connected with the Internet. It is estimated that in 10 years’ time there will be 150 billion networked measuring sensors, 20 times more than people on Earth. Then, the amount of data will double every 12 hours. Many companies are already trying to turn this Big Data into Big Money.\n\nEverything will become intelligent; soon we will not only have smart phones, but also smart homes, smart factories and smart cities. Should we also expect these developments to result in smart nations and a smarter planet?\n\nThe field of artificial intelligence is, indeed, making breathtaking advances. In particular, it is contributing to the automation of data analysis. Artificial intelligence is no longer programmed line by line, but is now capable of learning, thereby continuously developing itself. Recently, Google's DeepMind algorithm taught itself how to win 49 Atari games. Algorithms can now recognize handwritten language and patterns almost as well as humans and even complete some tasks better than them. They are able to describe the contents of photos and videos. Today 70% of all financial transactions are performed by algorithms. News content is, in part, automatically generated. This all has radical economic consequences: in the coming 10 to 20 years around half of today's jobs will be threatened by algorithms. 40% of today's top 500 companies will have vanished in a decade.\n\nIt can be expected that supercomputers will soon surpass human capabilities in almost all areas—somewhere between 2020 and 2060. Experts are starting to ring alarm bells. Technology visionaries, such as Elon Musk from Tesla Motors, Bill Gates from Microsoft and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, are warning that super-intelligence is a serious danger for humanity, possibly even more dangerous than nuclear weapons.\n\nOne thing is clear: the way in which we organize the economy and society will change fundamentally. We are experiencing the largest transformation since the end of the Second World War; after the automation of production and the creation of self-driving cars the automation of society is next. With this, society is at a crossroads, which promises great opportunities, but also considerable risks. If we take the wrong decisions it could threaten our greatest historical achievements.\n\nIn the 1940s, the American mathematician Norbert Wiener (1894–1964) invented cybernetics. According to him, the behavior of systems could be controlled by the means of suitable feedbacks. Very soon, some researchers imagined controlling the economy and society according to this basic principle, but the necessary technology was not available at that time.\n\nToday, Singapore is seen as a perfect example of a data-controlled society. What started as a program to protect its citizens from terrorism has ended up influencing economic and immigration policy, the property market and school curricula. China is taking a similar route. Recently, Baidu, the Chinese equivalent of Google, invited the military to take part in the China Brain Project. It involves running so-called deep learning algorithms over the search engine data collected about its users. Beyond this, a kind of social control is also planned. According to recent reports, every Chinese citizen will receive a so-called ”Citizen Score”, which will determine under what conditions they may get loans, jobs, or travel visa to other countries. This kind of individual monitoring would include people’s Internet surfing and the behavior of their social contacts (see ”Spotlight on China”).\n\nWith consumers facing increasingly frequent credit checks and some online shops experimenting with personalized prices, we are on a similar path in the West. It is also increasingly clear that we are all in the focus of institutional surveillance. This was revealed in 2015 when details of the British secret service's \"Karma Police\" program became public, showing the comprehensive screening of everyone's Internet use. Is Big Brother now becoming a reality?\n\nEverything started quite harmlessly. Search engines and recommendation platforms began to offer us personalised suggestions for products and services. This information is based on personal and meta-data that has been gathered from previous searches, purchases and mobility behaviour, as well as social interactions. While officially, the identity of the user is protected, it can, in practice, be inferred quite easily. Today, algorithms know pretty well what we do, what we think and how we feel—possibly even better than our friends and family or even ourselves. Often the recommendations we are offered fit so well that the resulting decisions feel as if they were our own, even though they are actually not our decisions. In fact, we are being remotely controlled ever more successfully in this manner. The more is known about us, the less likely our choices are to be free and not predetermined by others.\n\nBut it won't stop there. Some software platforms are moving towards “persuasive computing.” In the future, using sophisticated manipulation technologies, these platforms will be able to steer us through entire courses of action, be it for the execution of complex work processes or to generate free content for Internet platforms, from which corporations earn billions. The trend goes from programming computers to programming people.\n\nThese technologies are also becoming increasingly popular in the world of politics. Under the label of “nudging,” and on massive scale, governments are trying to steer citizens towards healthier or more environmentally friendly behaviour by means of a \"nudge\"—a modern form of paternalism. The new, caring government is not only interested in what we do, but also wants to make sure that we do the things that it considers to be right. The magic phrase is \"big nudging\", which is the combination of big data with nudging. To many, this appears to be a sort of digital scepter that allows one to govern the masses efficiently, without having to involve citizens in democratic processes. Could this overcome vested interests and optimize the course of the world? If so, then citizens could be governed by a data-empowered “wise king”, who would be able to produce desired economic and social outcomes almost as if with a digital magic wand.\n\nBut one look at the relevant scientific literature shows that attempts to control opinions, in the sense of their \"optimization\", are doomed to fail because of the complexity of the problem. The dynamics of the formation of opinions are full of surprises. Nobody knows how the digital magic wand, that is to say the manipulative nudging technique, should best be used. What would have been the right or wrong measure often is apparent only afterwards. During the German swine flu epidemic in 2009, for example, everybody was encouraged to go for vaccination. However, we now know that a certain percentage of those who received the immunization were affected by an unusual disease, narcolepsy. Fortunately, there were not more people who chose to get vaccinated!\n\nAnother example is the recent attempt of health insurance providers to encourage increased exercise by handing out smart fitness bracelets, with the aim of reducing the amount of cardiovascular disease in the population; but in the end, this might result in more hip operations. In a complex system, such as society, an improvement in one area almost inevitably leads to deterioration in another. Thus, large-scale interventions can sometimes prove to be massive mistakes.\n\nRegardless of this, criminals, terrorists and extremists will try and manage to take control of the digital magic wand sooner or later—perhaps even without us noticing. Almost all companies and institutions have already been hacked, even the Pentagon, the White House, and the NSA.\n\nA further problem arises when adequate transparency and democratic control are lacking: the erosion of the system from the inside. Search algorithms and recommendation systems can be influenced. Companies can bid on certain combinations of words to gain more favourable results. Governments are probably able to influence the outcomes too. During elections, they might nudge undecided voters towards supporting them—a manipulation that would be hard to detect. Therefore, whoever controls this technology can win elections—by nudging themselves to power.\n\nThis problem is exacerbated by the fact that, in many countries, a single search engine or social media platform has a predominant market share. It could decisively influence the public and interfere with these countries remotely. Even though the European Court of Justice judgment made on 6th October 2015 limits the unrestrained export of European data, the underlying problem still has not been solved within Europe, and even less so elsewhere.\n\nWhat undesirable side effects can we expect? In order for manipulation to stay unnoticed, it takes a so-called resonance effect—suggestions that are sufficiently customized to each individual. In this way, local trends are gradually reinforced by repetition, leading all the way to the \"filter bubble\" or \"echo chamber effect\": in the end, all you might get is your own opinions reflected back at you. This causes social polarization, resulting in the formation of separate groups that no longer understand each other and find themselves increasingly at conflict with one another. In this way, personalized information can unintentionally destroy social cohesion. This can be currently observed in American politics, where Democrats and Republicans are increasingly drifting apart, so that political compromises become almost impossible. The result is a fragmentation, possibly even a disintegration, of society.\n\nOwing to the resonance effect, a large-scale change of opinion in society can be only produced slowly and gradually. The effects occur with a time lag, but, also, they cannot be easily undone. It is possible, for example, that resentment against minorities or migrants get out of control; too much national sentiment can cause discrimination, extremism and conflict.\n\nPerhaps even more significant is the fact that manipulative methods change the way we make our decisions. They override the otherwise relevant cultural and social cues, at least temporarily. In summary, the large-scale use of manipulative methods could cause serious social damage, including the brutalization of behavior in the digital world. Who should be held responsible for this?\n\nThis raises legal issues that, given the huge fines against tobacco companies, banks, IT and automotive companies over the past few years, should not be ignored. But which laws, if any, might be violated? First of all, it is clear that manipulative technologies restrict the freedom of choice. If the remote control of our behaviour worked perfectly, we would essentially be digital slaves, because we would only execute decisions that were actually made by others before. Of course, manipulative technologies are only partly effective. Nevertheless, our freedom is disappearing slowly, but surely—in fact, slowly enough that there has been little resistance from the population, so far.\n\nThe insights of the great enlightener Immanuel Kant seem to be highly relevant here. Among other things, he noted that a state that attempts to determine the happiness of its citizens is a despot. However, the right of individual self-development can only be exercised by those who have control over their lives, which presupposes informational self-determination. This is about nothing less than our most important constitutional rights. A democracy cannot work well unless those rights are respected. If they are constrained, this undermines our constitution, our society and the state.\n\nAs manipulative technologies such as big nudging function in a similar way to personalized advertising, other laws are affected too. Advertisements must be marked as such and must not be misleading. They are also not allowed to utilize certain psychological tricks such as subliminal stimuli. This is why it is prohibited to show a soft drink in a film for a split-second, because then the advertising is not consciously perceptible while it may still have a subconscious effect. Furthermore, the current widespread collection and processing of personal data is certainly not compatible with the applicable data protection laws in European countries and elsewhere.\n\nFinally, the legality of personalized pricing is questionable, because it could be a misuse of insider information. Other relevant aspects are possible breaches of the principles of equality and non-discrimination—and of competition laws, as free market access and price transparency are no longer guaranteed. The situation is comparable to businesses that sell their products cheaper in other countries, but try to prevent purchases via these countries. Such cases have resulted in high punitive fines in the past.\n\nPersonalized advertising and pricing cannot be compared to classical advertising or discount coupons, as the latter are non-specific and also do not invade our privacy with the goal to take advantage of our psychological weaknesses and knock out our critical thinking.\n\nFurthermore, let us not forget that, in the academic world, even harmless decision experiments are considered to be experiments with human subjects, which would have to be approved by a publicly accountable ethics committee. In each and every case the persons concerned are required to give their informed consent. In contrast, a single click to confirm that we agree with the contents of a hundred-page “terms of use” agreement (which is the case these days for many information platforms) is woefully inadequate.\n\nNonetheless, experiments with manipulative technologies, such as nudging, are performed with millions of people, without informing them, without transparency and without ethical constraints. Even large social networks like Facebook or online dating platforms such as OkCupid have already publicly admitted to undertaking these kinds of social experiments. If we want to avoid irresponsible research on humans and society (just think of the involvement of psychologists in the torture scandals of the recent past), then we urgently need to impose high standards, especially scientific quality criteria and a code of conduct similar to the Hippocratic Oath.Has our thinking, our freedom, our democracy been hacked?\n\nLet us suppose there was a super-intelligent machine with godlike knowledge and superhuman abilities: would we follow its instructions? This seems possible. But if we did that, then the warnings expressed by Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Stephen Hawking and others would have become true: computers would have taken control of the world. We must be clear that a super-intelligence could also make mistakes, lie, pursue selfish interests or be manipulated. Above all, it could not be compared with the distributed, collective intelligence of the entire population.\n\nThe idea of replacing the thinking of all citizens by a computer cluster would be absurd, because that would dramatically lower the diversity and quality of the solutions achievable. It is already clear that the problems of the world have not decreased despite the recent flood of data and the use of personalized information—on the contrary! World peace is fragile. The long-term change in the climate could lead to the greatest loss of species since the extinction of dinosaurs. We are also far from having overcome the financial crisis and its impact on the economy. Cyber-crime is estimated to cause an annual loss of 3 trillion dollars. States and terrorists are preparing for cyberwarfare.\n\nIn a rapidly changing world a super-intelligence can never make perfect decisions (see Fig. 1): systemic complexity is increasing faster than data volumes, which are growing faster than the ability to process them, and data transfer rates are limited. This results in disregarding local knowledge and facts, which are important to reach good solutions. Distributed, local control methods are often superior to centralized approaches, especially in complex systems whose behaviors are highly variable, hardly predictable and not capable of real-time optimization. This is already true for traffic control in cities, but even more so for the social and economic systems of our highly networked, globalized world.\n\nFurthermore, there is a danger that the manipulation of decisions by powerful algorithms undermines the basis of \"collective intelligence,\" which can flexibly adapt to the challenges of our complex world. For collective intelligence to work, information searches and decision-making by individuals must occur independently. If our judgments and decisions are predetermined by algorithms, however, this truly leads to a brainwashing of the people. Intelligent beings are downgraded to mere receivers of commands, who automatically respond to stimuli.\n\nIn other words: personalized information builds a \"filter bubble\" around us, a kind of digital prison for our thinking. How could creativity and thinking \"out of the box\" be possible under such conditions? Ultimately, a centralized system of technocratic behavioral and social control using a super-intelligent information system would result in a new form of dictatorship. Therefore, the top-down controlled society, which comes under the banner of \"liberal paternalism,\" is in principle nothing else than a totalitarian regime with a rosy cover.\n\nIn fact, big nudging aims to bring the actions of many people into line, and to manipulate their perspectives and decisions. This puts it in the arena of propaganda and the targeted incapacitation of the citizen by behavioral control. We expect that the consequences would be fatal in the long term, especially when considering the above-mentioned effect of undermining culture.\n\nA Better Digital Society Is Possible\n\nDespite fierce global competition, democracies would be wise not to cast the achievements of many centuries overboard. In contrast to other political regimes, Western democracies have the advantage that they have already learned to deal with pluralism and diversity. Now they just have to learn how to capitalize on them more.\n\nIn the future, those countries will lead that reach a healthy balance between business, government and citizens. This requires networked thinking and the establishment of an information, innovation, product and service \"ecosystem.\" In order to work well, it is not only important to create opportunities for participation, but also to support diversity. Because there is no way to determine the best goal function: should we optimize the gross national product per capita or sustainability? Power or peace? Happiness or life expectancy? Often enough, what would have been better is only known after the fact. By allowing the pursuit of various different goals, a pluralistic society is better able to cope with the range of unexpected challenges to come.\n\nCentralized, top-down control is a solution of the past, which is only suitable for systems of low complexity. Therefore, federal systems and majority decisions are the solutions of the present. With economic and cultural evolution, social complexity will continue to rise. Therefore, the solution for the future is collective intelligence. This means that citizen science, crowdsourcing and online discussion platforms are eminently important new approaches to making more knowledge, ideas and resources available.\n\nCollective intelligence requires a high degree of diversity. This is, however, being reduced by today's personalized information systems, which reinforce trends.\n\nSociodiversity is as important as biodiversity. It fuels not only collective intelligence and innovation, but also resilience—the ability of our society to cope with unexpected shocks. Reducing sociodiversity often also reduces the functionality and performance of an economy and society. This is the reason why totalitarian regimes often end up in conflict with their neighbors. Typical long-term consequences are political instability and war, as have occurred time and again throughout history. Pluralism and participation are therefore not to be seen primarily as concessions to citizens, but as functional prerequisites for thriving, complex, modern societies.\n\nIn summary, it can be said that we are now at a crossroads (see Fig. 2). Big data, artificial intelligence, cybernetics and behavioral economics are shaping our society—for better or worse. If such widespread technologies are not compatible with our society's core values, sooner or later they will cause extensive damage. They could lead to an automated society with totalitarian features. In the worst case, a centralized artificial intelligence would control what we know, what we think and how we act. We are at the historic moment, where we have to decide on the right path—a path that allows us all to benefit from the digital revolution. Therefore, we urge to adhere to the following fundamental principles:\n\n1. to increasingly decentralize the function of information systems;\n\n3. to improve transparency in order to achieve greater trust;\n\n4. to reduce the distortion and pollution of information;\n\n10. to promote responsible behavior of citizens in the digital world through digital literacy and enlightenment.\n\nFollowing this digital agenda we would all benefit from the fruits of the digital revolution: the economy, government and citizens alike. What are we waiting for?\n\nBig data and artificial intelligence are undoubtedly important innovations. They have an enormous potential to catalyze economic value and social progress, from personalized healthcare to sustainable cities. It is totally unacceptable, however, to use these technologies to incapacitate the citizen. Big nudging and citizen scores abuse centrally collected personal data for behavioral control in ways that are totalitarian in nature. This is not only incompatible with human rights and democratic principles, but also inappropriate to manage modern, innovative societies. In order to solve the genuine problems of the world, far better approaches in the fields of information and risk management are required. The research area of responsible innovation and the initiative ”Data for Humanity” (see \"Big Data for the benefit of society and humanity\") provide guidance as to how big data and artificial intelligence should be used for the benefit of society.\n\nWhat can we do now? First, even in these times of digital revolution, the basic rights of citizens should be protected, as they are a fundamental prerequisite of a modern functional, democratic society. This requires the creation of a new social contract, based on trust and cooperation, which sees citizens and customers not as obstacles or resources to be exploited, but as partners. For this, the state would have to provide an appropriate regulatory framework, which ensures that technologies are designed and used in ways that are compatible with democracy. This would have to guarantee informational self-determination, not only theoretically, but also practically, because it is a precondition for us to lead our lives in a self-determined and responsible manner.\n\nThere should also be a right to get a copy of personal data collected about us. It should be regulated by law that this information must be automatically sent, in a standardized format, to a personal data store, through which individuals could manage the use of their data (potentially supported by particular AI-based digital assistants). To ensure greater privacy and to prevent discrimination, the unauthorised use of data would have to be punishable by law. Individuals would then be able to decide who can use their information, for what purpose and for how long. Furthermore, appropriate measures should be taken to ensure that data is securely stored and exchanged.\n\nSophisticated reputation systems considering multiple criteria could help to increase the quality of information on which our decisions are based. If data filters and recommendation and search algorithms would be selectable and configurable by the user, we could look at problems from multiple perspectives, and we would be less prone to manipulation by distorted information.\n\nIn addition, we need an efficient complaints procedure for citizens, as well as effective sanctions for violations of the rules. Finally, in order to create sufficient transparency and trust, leading scientific institutions should act as trustees of the data and algorithms that currently evade democratic control. This would also require an appropriate code of conduct that, at the very least, would have to be followed by anyone with access to sensitive data and algorithms—a kind of Hippocratic Oath for IT professionals.\n\nFurthermore, we would require a digital agenda to lay the foundation for new jobs and the future of the digital society. Every year we invest billions in the agricultural sector and public infrastructure, schools and universities—to the benefit of industry and the service sector.\n\nWhich public systems do we therefore need to ensure that the digital society becomes a success? First, completely new educational concepts are needed. This should be more focused on critical thinking, creativity, inventiveness and entrepreneurship than on creating standardised workers (whose tasks, in the future, will be done by robots and computer algorithms). Education should also provide an understanding of the responsible and critical use of digital technologies, because citizens must be aware of how the digital world is intertwined with the physical one. In order to effectively and responsibly exercise their rights, citizens must have an understanding of these technologies, but also of what uses are illegitimate. This is why there is all the more need for science, industry, politics, and educational institutions to make this knowledge widely available.\n\nSecondly, a participatory platform is needed that makes it easier for people to become self-employed, set up their own projects, find collaboration partners, market products and services worldwide, manage resources and pay tax and social security contributions (a kind of sharing economy for all). To complement this, towns and even villages could set up centers for the emerging digital communities (such as fab labs), where ideas can be jointly developed and tested for free. Thanks to the open and innovative approach found in these centers, massive, collaborative innovation could be promoted.\n\nParticular kinds of competitions could provide additional incentives for innovation, help increase public visibility and generate momentum for a participatory digital society. They could be particularly useful in mobilising civil society to ensure local contributions to global problems solving (for example, by means of \"Climate Olympics\"). For instance, platforms aiming to coordinate scarce resources could help unleash the huge potential of the circular and sharing economy, which is still largely untapped.\n\nWith the commitment to an open data strategy, governments and industry would increasingly make data available for science and public use, to create suitable conditions for an efficient information and innovation ecosystem that keeps pace with the challenges of our world. This could be encouraged by tax cuts, in the same way as they were granted in some countries for the use of environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nThirdly, building a \"digital nervous system,\" run by the citizens, could open up new opportunities of the Internet of Things for everyone and provide real-time data measurements available to all. If we want to use resources in a more sustainable way and slow down climate change, we need to measure the positive and negative side effects of our interactions with others and our environment. By using appropriate feedback loops, systems could be influenced in such a way that they achieve the desired outcomes by means of self-organization.\n\nFor this to succeed we would need various incentive and exchange systems, available to all economic, political and social innovators. This could create entirely new markets and, therefore, also the basis for new prosperity. Unleashing the virtually unlimited potential of the digital economy would be greatly promoted by a pluralistic financial system (for example, functionally differentiated currencies) and new regulations for the compensation for inventions.\n\nTo better cope with the complexity and diversity of our future world and to turn it into an advantage, we will require personal digital assistants. These digital assistants will also benefit from developments in the field of artificial intelligence. In the future it can be expected that numerous networks combining human and artificial intelligence will be flexibly built and reconfigured, as needed. However, in order for us to retain control of our lives, these networks should be controlled in a distributed way. In particular, one would also have to be able to log in and log out as desired.\n\nA \"Wikipedia of Cultures\" could eventually help to coordinate various activities in a highly diverse world and to make them compatible with each other. It would make the mostly implicit success principles of the world's cultures explicit, so that they could be combined in new ways. A \"Cultural Genome Project\" like this would also be a kind of peace project, because it would raise public awareness for the value of sociocultural diversity. Global companies have long known that culturally diverse and multidisciplinary teams are more successful than homogeneous ones. However, the framework needed to efficiently collate knowledge and ideas from lots of people in order to create collective intelligence is still missing in many places. To change this, the provision of online deliberation platforms would be highly useful. They could also create the framework needed to realize an upgraded, digital democracy, with greater participatory opportunities for citizens. This is important, because many of the problems facing the world today can only be managed with contributions from civil society.\n\nBig data, meet Big Brother: China invents the digital totalitarian state.

However, the principle of top-down control increasingly fails, since the complexity of society grows in an explosive way as we go on networking our world. Distributed control approaches will become ever more important. Only by means of collective intelligence will it be possible to find appropriate solutions to the complexity challenges of our world.\n\nOur society is at a crossroads: If ever more powerful algorithms would be controlled by a few decision-makers and reduce our self-determination, we would fall back in a Feudalism 2.0, as important historical achievements would be lost. Now, however, we have the chance to choose the path to digital democracy or democracy 2.0, which would benefit us all (see also https://vimeo.com/147442522 ).\n\nSpotlight on China: Is this what the Future of Society looks like?\n\nHow would behavioural and social control impact our lives? The concept of a Citizen Score, which is now being implemented in China, gives an idea. There, all citizens are rated on a one-dimensional ranking scale. Everything they do gives plus or minus points. This is not only aimed at mass surveillance. The score depends on an individual's clicks on the Internet and their politically-correct conduct or not, and it determines their credit terms, their access to certain jobs, and travel visas. Therefore, the Citizen Score is about behavioural and social control. Even the behaviour of friends and acquaintances affects this score, i.e. the principle of clan liability is also applied: everyone becomes both a guardian of virtue and a kind of snooping informant, at the same time; unorthodox thinkers are isolated. Were similar principles to spread in democratic countries, it would be ultimately irrelevant whether it was the state or influential companies that set the rules. In both cases, the pillars of democracy would be directly threatened:\n\nSuch a control of society would turn away from self-responsible citizens to individuals as underlings, leading to a Feudalism 2.0. This is diametrically opposed to democratic values. It is therefore time for an Enlightenment 2.0, which would feed into a Democracy 2.0, based on digital self-determination. This requires democratic technologies: information systems, which are compatible with democratic principles - otherwise they will destroy our society.\n\nHe who has large amounts of data can manipulate people in subtle ways. But even benevolent decision-makers may do more wrong than right, says Dirk Helbing.\n\nProponents of Nudging argue that people do not take optimal decisions and it is, therefore, necessary to help them. This school of thinking is known as paternalism. However, Nudging does not choose the way of informing and persuading people. It rather exploits psychological weaknesses in order to bring us to certain behaviours, i.e. we are tricked. The scientific approach underlying this approach is called \"behaviorism\", which is actually long out of date.\n\nDecades ago, Burrhus Frederic Skinner conditioned rats, pigeons and dogs by rewards and punishments (for example, by feeding them or applying painful electric shocks). Today one tries to condition people in similar ways. Instead of in a Skinner box, we are living in a \"filter bubble\": with personalized information our thinking is being steered. With personalized prices, we may be even punished or rewarded, for example, for (un)desired clicks on the Internet. The combination of Nudging with Big Data has therefore led to a new form of Nudging that we may call \"Big Nudging\". The increasing amount of personal information about us, which is often collected without our consent, reveals what we think, how we feel and how we can be manipulated. This insider information is exploited to manipulate us to make choices that we would otherwise not make, to buy some overpriced products or those that we do not need, or perhaps to give our vote to a certain political party.\n\nHowever, Big Nudging is not suitable to solve many of our problems. This is particularly true for the complexity-related challenges of our world. Although already 90 countries use Nudging, it has not reduced our societal problems - on the contrary. Global warming is progressing. World peace is fragile, and terrorism is on the rise. Cybercrime explodes, and also the economic and debt crisis is not solved in many countries.\n\nThere is also no solution to the inefficiency of financial markets, as Nudging guru Richard Thaler recently admitted. In his view, if the state would control financial markets, this would rather aggravate the problem. But why should one then control our society in a top-down way, which is even more complex than a financial market? Society is not a machine, and complex systems cannot be steered like a car. This can be understood by discussing another complex system: our bodies. To cure diseases, one needs to take the right medicine at the right time in the right dose. Many treatments also have serious side and interaction effects. The same, of course, is expected to apply to social interventions by Big Nudging. Often is not clear in advance what would be good or bad for society. 60 percent of the scientific results in psychology are not reproducible. Therefore, chances are to cause more harm than good by Big Nudging.\n\nFurthermore, there is no measure, which is good for all people. For example, in recent decades, we have seen food advisories changing all the time. Many people also suffer from food intolerances, which can even be fatal. Mass screenings for certain kinds of cancer and other diseases are now being viewed quite critically, because the side effects of wrong diagnoses often outweigh the benefits. Therefore, if one decided to use Big Nudging, a solid scientific basis, transparency, ethical evaluation and democratic control would be really crucial. The measures taken would have to guarantee statistically significant improvements, and the side effects would have to be acceptable. Users should be made aware of them (in analogy to a medical leaflet), and the treated persons would have to have the last word.\n\nIn addition, applying one and the same measure to the entire population would not be good. But far too little is known to take appropriate individual measures. Not only is it important for society to apply different treatments in order to maintain diversity, but correlations (regarding what measure to take in what particular context) matter as well. For the functioning of society it is essential that people apply different roles, which are fitting to the respective situation they are in. Big Nudging is far from being able to deliver this.\n\nCurrent Big-Data-based personalization rather creates new problems such as discrimination. For instance, if we make health insurance rates dependent on certain diets, then Jews, Muslims and Christians, women and men will have to pay different rates. Thus, a bunch of new problems is arising.\n\nRichard Thaler is, therefore, not getting tired to emphasize that Nudging should only be used in beneficial ways. As a prime example, how to use Nudging, he mentions a GPS-based route guidance system. This, however, is turned on and off by the user. The user also specifies the respective goal. The digital assistant then offers several alternatives, between which the user can freely choose. After that, the digital assistant supports the user as good as it can in reaching the goal and in making better decisions. This would certainly be the right approach to improve people's behaviours, but today the spirit of Big Nudging is quite different from this.\n\nEurope must guarantee citizens a right to a digital copy of all data about them (Right to a Copy), says Ernst Hafen. A first step towards data democracy would be to establish cooperative banks for personal data that are owned by the citizens rather than by corporate shareholders.\n\nMedicine can profit from health data. However, access to personal data must be controlled the persons (the data subjects) themselves. The “Right to a Copy” forms the basis for such a control.\n\nIn Europe, we like to point out that we live in free, democratic societies. We have almost unconsciously become dependent on multinational data firms, however, whose free services we pay for with our own data. Personal data—which is now sometimes referred to as a “new asset class” or the oil of the 21st Century—is greatly sought after. However, thus far nobody has managed to extract the maximum use from personal data because it lies in many different data sets. Google and Facebook may know more about our health than our doctor, but even these firms cannot collate all of our data, because they rightly do not have access to our patient files, shopping receipts, or information about our genomic make-up. In contrast to other assets, data can be copied with almost no associated cost. Every person should have the right to obtain a copy of all their personal data. In this way, they can control the use and aggregation of their data and decide themselves whether to give access to friends, another doctor, or the scientific community.\n\nThe emergence of mobile health sensors and apps means that patients can contribute significant medical insights. By recording their bodily health on their smartphones, such as medical indicators and the side effects of medications, they supply important data which make it possible to observe how treatments are applied, evaluate health technologies, and conduct evidence-based medicine in general. It is also a moral obligation to give citizens access to copies of their data and allow them to take part in medical research, because it will save lives and make health care more affordable.\n\nEuropean countries should copper-fasten the digital self-determination of their citizens by enshrining the “Right to a Copy” in their constitutions, as has been proposed in Switzerland. In this way, citizens can use their data to play an active role in the global data economy. If they can store copies of their data in non-profit, citizen-controlled, cooperative institutions, a large portion of the economic value of personal data could be returned to society. The cooperative institutions would act as trustees in managing the data of their members. This would result in the democratization of the market for personal data and the end of digital dependence.\n\nCitizens must be allowed to actively participate\n\nIn order to deal with future technology in a responsible way, it is necessary that each one of us can participate in the decision-making process, argues Bruno S. Frey from the University of Basel\n\nHow can responsible innovation be promoted effectively? Appeals to the public have little, if any, effect if the institutions or rules shaping human interactions are not designed to incentivize and enable people to meet these requests.\n\nSeveral types of institutions should be considered. Most importantly, society must be decentralized, following the principle of subsidiarity. Three dimensions matter.\n\nThese types of decentralization will continue to be of major importance in the digital society of the future.\n\nIn addition, citizens must have the opportunity to directly participate in decision-making on particular issues by means of popular referenda. In the discourse prior to such a referendum, all relevant arguments should be brought forward and stated in an organized fashion. The various proposals about how to solve a particular problem should be compared and narrowed down to those which seem to be most promising, and integrated insomuch as possible during a mediation process. Finally, a referendum needs to take place, which serves to identify the most viable solution for the local conditions (viable in the sense that it enjoys a diverse range of support in the electorate).\n\nNowadays, on-line deliberation tools can efficiently support such processes. This makes it possible to consider a larger and more diverse range of ideas and knowledge, harnessing “collective intelligence” to produce better policy proposals.\n\nAnother way to implement the ten proposals would be to create new, unorthodox institutions. For example, it could be made compulsory for every official body to take on an “advocatus diaboli”. This lateral thinker would be tasked with developing counter-arguments and alternatives to each proposal. This would reduce the tendency to think along the lines of “political correctness” and unconventional approaches to the problem would also be considered.\n\nAnother unorthodox measure would be to choose among the alternatives considered reasonable during the discourse process using random decision-making mechanisms. Such an approach increases the chance that unconventional and generally disregarded proposals and ideas would be integrated into the digital society of the future.\n\nBruno Frey (* 1941) is an academic economist and Permanent Visiting Professor at the University of Basel where he directs the Center for Research in Economics and Well-Being (CREW). He is also Research Director of the Center for Research in Economics, Management and the Arts (CREMA) in Zurich.\n\nWhen technology determines how we see the world, there is a threat of misuse and deception. Thus, innovation must reflect our values, argues Jeroen van den Hoven.\n\nGermany was recently rocked by an industrial scandal of global proportions. The revelations led to the resignation of the CEO of one of the largest car manufacturers, a grave loss of consumer confidence, a dramatic slump in share price and economic damage for the entire car industry. There was even talk of severe damage to the “Made in Germany” brand. The compensation payments will be in the range of billions of Euro.\n\nThe background to the scandal was a situation whereby VW and other car manufacturers used manipulative software which could detect the conditions under which the environmental compliance of a vehicle was tested. The software algorithm altered the behavior of the engine so that it emitted fewer pollutant exhaust fumes under test conditions than in normal circumstances. In this way, it cheated the test procedure. The full reduction of emissions occurred only during the tests, but not in normal use.\n\nIn the 21st Century, we urgently need to address the question of how we can implement ethical standards technologically.\n\nSimilarly, algorithms, computer code, software, models and data will increasingly determine what we see in the digital society, and what are choices are with regard to health insurance, finance and politics. This brings new risks for the economy and society. In particular, there is a danger of deception.\n\nThus, it is important to understand that our values are embodied in the things we create. Otherwise, the technological design of the future will determine the shape of our society (“code is law”). If these values are self-serving, discriminatory or contrary to the ideals of freedom and personal privacy, this will damage our society. Thus, in the 21st Century we must urgently address the question of how we can implement ethical standards technologically. The challenge calls for us to “design for value”.\n\nIf we lack the motivation to develop the technological tools, science and institutions necessary to align the digital world with our shared values, the future looks very bleak. Thankfully, the European Union has invested in an extensive research and development program for responsible innovation. Furthermore, the EU countries which passed the Lund and Rome Declarations emphasized that innovation needs to be carried out responsibly. Among other things, this means that innovation should be directed at developing intelligent solutions to societal problems, which can harmonize values such as efficiency, security and sustainability. Genuine innovation does not involve deceiving people into believing that their cars are sustainable and efficient. Genuine innovation means creating technologies that can actually satisfy these requirements.\n\nTechnology needs users who can control it\n\nRather than letting intelligent technology diminish our brainpower, we should learn to better control it, says Gerd Gigerenzer —beginning in childhood.\n\nThe digital revolution provides an impressive array of possibilities: thousands of apps, the Internet of Things, and almost permanent connectivity to the world. But in the excitement, one thing is easily forgotten: innovative technology needs competent users who can control it rather than be controlled by it.\n\nOne of my doctoral students sits at his computer and appears to be engrossed in writing his dissertation. At the same time his e-mail inbox is open, all day long. He is in fact waiting to be interrupted. It's easy to recognize how many interruptions he had in the course of the day by looking at the flow of his writing.\n\n\"When a text comes in, I just have to look, no matter what. Fortunately, my phone shows me the text as a pop up at first… so I don't have to do too much looking while I'm driving.\" If, at the speed of 50 miles per hour, she takes only 2 seconds to glance at her cell phone, she's just driven 48 yards \"blind\". That young woman is risking a car accident. Her smart phone has taken control of her behavior—as is the case for the 20 to 30 percent of Germans who also text while driving.\n\nDuring the parliamentary elections in India in 2014, the largest democratic election in the world with over 800 million potential voters, there were three main candidates: N. Modi, A. Kejriwal, and R. Ghandi. In a study, undecided voters could find out more information about these candidates using an Internet search engine. However, the participants did not know that the web pages had been manipulated: For one group, more positive items about Modi popped up on the first page and negative ones later on. The other groups experienced the same for the other candidates. This and similar manipulative procedures are common practice on the Internet. It is estimated that for candidates who appear on the first page thanks to such manipulation, the number of votes they receive from undecided voters increases by 20 percentage points.\n\nIn each of these cases, human behavior is controlled by digital technology. Losing control is nothing new, but the digital revolution has increased the possibility of that happening.\n\nWhat can we do? There are three competing visions. One is techno-paternalism, which replaces (flawed) human judgment with algorithms. The distracted doctoral student could continue readings his emails and use thesis-writing software; all he would need to do is input key information on the topic. Such algorithms would solve the annoying problem of plagiarism scandals by making them an everyday occurrence.\n\nAlthough still in the domain of science fiction, human judgment is already being replaced by computer programs in many areas. The BabyConnect app, for instance, tracks the daily development of infants—height, weight, number of times it was nursed, how often its diapers were changed, and much more—while newer apps compare the baby with other users' children in a real-time database. For parents, their baby becomes a data vector, and normal discrepancies often cause unnecessary concern.\n\nThe second vision is known as \"nudging\". Rather than letting the algorithm do all the work, people are steered into a particular direction, often without being aware of it. The experiment on the elections in India is an example of that. We know that the first page of Google search results receives about 90% of all clicks, and half of these are the first two results. This knowledge about human behavior is taken advantage of by manipulating the order of results so that the positive ones about a particular candidate or a particular commercial product appear on the first page. In countries such as Germany, where web searches are dominated by one search engine (Google), this leads to endless possibilities to sway voters. Like techno-paternalism, nudging takes over the helm.\n\nBut there is a third possibility. My vision is risk literacy, where people are equipped with the competencies to control media rather than be controlled by it. In general, risk literacy concerns informed ways of dealing with risk-related areas such as health, money, and modern technologies. Digital risk literacy means being able to take advantage of digital technologies without becoming dependent on or manipulated by them. That is not as hard as it sounds. My doctoral student has since learned to switch on his email account only three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, so that he can work on his dissertation without constant interruption.\n\nLearning digital self-control needs to begin as a child, at school and also from the example set by parents. Some paternalists may scoff at the idea, stating that humans lack the intelligence and self-discipline to ever become risk literate. But centuries ago the same was said about learning to read and write—which a majority of people in industrial countries can now do. In the same way, people can learn to deal with risks more sensibly. To achieve this, we need to radically rethink strategies and invest in people rather than replace or manipulate them with intelligent technologies. In the 21st century, we need less paternalism and nudging and more informed, critical, and risk-savvy citizens. It's time to snatch away the remote control from technology and take our lives into our own hands.\n\nThe power of data can be used for good and bad purposes. Roberto Zicari and Andrej Zwitter have formulated five principles of Big Data Ethics.\n\nIn recent times there have been a growing number of voices — from tech visionaries like Elon Musk (Tesla Motors), to Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Steve Wozniak (Apple) — warning of the dangers of artificial intelligence (AI). A petition against automated weapon systems was signed by 200,000 people and an open letter recently published by MIT calls for a new, inclusive approach to the coming digital society.\n\nWe must realize that big data, like any other tool, can be used for good and bad purposes. In this sense, the decision by the European Court of Justice against the Safe Harbour Agreement on human rights grounds is understandable.\n\nStates, international organizations and private actors now employ big data in a variety of spheres. It is important that all those who profit from big data are aware of their moral responsibility. For this reason, the Data for Humanity Initiative was established, with the goal of disseminating an ethical code of conduct for big data use. This initiative advances five fundamental ethical principles for big data users:\n\n1. “Do no harm”. The digital footprint that everyone now leaves behind exposes individuals, social groups and society as a whole to a certain degree of transparency and vulnerability. Those who have access to the insights afforded by big data must not harm third parties.\n\n2. Ensure that data is used in such a way that the results will foster the peaceful coexistence of humanity. The selection of content and access to data influences the world view of a society. Peaceful coexistence is only possible if data scientists are aware of their responsibility to provide even and unbiased access to data.\n\n3. Use data to help people in need. In addition to being economically beneficial, innovation in the sphere of big data could also create additional social value. In the age of global connectivity, it is now possible to create innovative big data tools which could help to support people in need.\n\n4. Use data to protect nature and reduce pollution of the environment. One of the biggest achievements of big data analysis is the development of efficient processes and synergy effects. Big data can only offer a sustainable economic and social future if such methods are also used to create and maintain a healthy and stable natural environment.\n\n5. Use data to eliminate discrimination and intolerance and to create a fair system of social coexistence. Social media has created a strengthened social network. This can only lead to long-term global stability if it is built on the principles of fairness, equality and justice.\n\nTo conclude, we would also like to draw attention to how interesting new possibilities afforded by big data could lead to a better future: \"As more data become less costly and technology breaks barriers to acquisition and analysis, the opportunity to deliver actionable information for civic purposes grows. This might be termed the 'common good' challenge for big data.\" (Jake Porway, DataKind). In the end, it is important to understand the turn to big data as an opportunity to do good and as a hope for a better future.\n\nIn the digital age, machines steer everyday life to a considerable extent already. We should, therefore, think twice before we share our personal data, says expert Yvonne Hofstetter\n\nIf Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) had experienced the digital era, for him it would have been the land of plenty. “Cybernetics is the science of information and control, regardless of whether the target of control is a machine or a living organism”, the founder of Cybernetics once explained in Hannover, Germany in 1960. In history, the world never produced such amount of data and information as it does today.\n\nCybernetics, a science asserting ubiquitous importance, makes a strong claim: “Everything can be controlled.” During the 20th century, both the US armed forces and the Soviet Union applied Cybernetics to control their arms’ race. The NATO had deployed so-called C3I systems (Command, Control, Communication and Information), a term for military infrastructure that leans linguistically to Wiener’s book on Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, published in 1948. Control refers to the control of machines as well as of individuals or entire social systems like military alliances, financial markets or, pointing to the 21st century, even the electorate. Its major premise: keeping the world under surveillance to collect data. Connecting people and things to the Internet of Everything is a perfect to way to obtain the required mass data as input to cybernetic control strategies.\n\nWith Cybernetics, Wiener proposed a new scientific concept: the closed-loop feedback. Feedback—e.g. the Likes we give, the online comments we make—is a major concept of digitization, too. Does that mean digitization is the most perfect implementation of Cybernetics? When we use smart devices, we are creating a ceaseless data stream disclosing our intentions, geo position or social environment. While we communicate more thoughtlessly than ever online, in the background, an ecosystem of artificial intelligence is evolving. Today, artificial intelligence is the sole technology being able to profile us and draw conclusions about our future behavior.\n\nAn automated control strategy, usually a learning machine, analyzes our actual situation and then computes a stimulus that should draw us closer to a more desirable “optimal” state. Increasingly, such controllers govern our daily lives. As digital assistants they help us making decisions in the vast ocean of optionality and intimidating uncertainty. Even Google Search is a control strategy. When typing a keyword, a user reveals his intentions. The Google search engine, in turn, will not just present a list with best hits, but a link list that embodies the highest (financial) value rather for the company than for the user. Doing it that way, i.e. listing corporate offerings at the very top of the search results, Google controls the user’s next clicks. This, the European Union argues, is a misuse.\n\nBut is there any way out? Yes, if we disconnected from the cybernetic loop. Just stop responding to a digital stimulus. Cybernetics will fail, if the controllable counterpart steps out of the loop. Yet, we are free to owe a response to a digital controller. However, as digitization further escalates, soon we may have no more choice. Hence, we are called on to fight for our freedom rights—afresh during the digital era and in particular at the rise of intelligent machines.\n\nFor Norbert Wiener (1894-1964), the digital era would be a paradise. “Cybernetics is the science of information and control, regardless of whether a machine or a living organism is being controlled”, the founder of cybernetics once said in Hanover, Germany in 1960.\n\nCybernetics, a science which claims ubiquitous importance makes a strong promise: “Everything is controllable.” During the 20th century, both the US armed forces and the Soviet Union applied cybernetics to control the arms’ race. NATO had deployed so-called C3I systems (Command, Control, Communication and Information), a term for military infrastructure that linguistically leans on Wiener’s book entitled Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine published in 1948. Control refers to the control of machines as well as of individuals or entire societal systems such as military alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Its basic requirements are: Integrating, collecting data and communicating. Connecting people and things to the Internet of Everything is a perfect way to obtain the required data as input of cybernetic control strategies.\n\nWith cybernetics, a new scientific concept was proposed: the closed-loop feedback. Feedback—such as the likes we give or the online comments we make—is another major concept related to digitization. Does this mean that digitization is the most perfect implementation of cybernetics? When we use smart devices, we create an endless data stream disclosing our intentions, geolocation or social environment. While we communicate more thoughtlessly than ever online, in the background, an artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem is evolving. Today, AI is the sole technology able to profile us and draw conclusions about our future behavior.\n\nAn automated control strategy, usually a learning machine, analyses our current state and computes a stimulus that should draw us closer to a more desirable “optimal” state. Increasingly, such controllers govern our daily lives. Such digital assistants help us to make decisions among the vast ocean of options and intimidating uncertainty. Even Google Search is a control strategy. When typing a keyword, a user reveals his intentions. The Google search engine, in turn, presents not only a list of the best hits, but also a list of links sorted according to their (financial) value to the company, rather than to the user. By listing corporate offerings at the very top of the search results, Google controls the user’s next clicks. That is a misuse of Google’s monopoly, the European Union argues.\n\nBut is there any way out? Yes, if we disconnect from the cybernetic loop and simply stop responding to the digital stimulus. Cybernetics will fail, if the controllable counterpart steps out of the loop. We should remain discreet and frugal with our data, even if it is difficult. However, as digitization further escalates, soon there may be no more choices left. Hence, we are called on to fight once again for our freedom in the digital era, particularly against the rise of intelligent machines.\n\nDirk Helbing is Professor of Computational Social Science at the Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences and affiliate professor at the Department of Computer Science at ETH Zurich.

Economy\n\nIt was the second game of a double-header, and the Washington Nationals had a problem. Not on the field, of course: The soon-to-be World Series champions were performing beautifully. But as they waited out a rain delay, something went awry behind the scenes. A task scheduler deep within the team’s analytics infrastructure stopped running.\n\nThe scheduler was in charge of collecting and aggregating game-time data for the Nationals’ analytics team. Like many tools of its kind, this one was based on cron, a decades-old workhorse for scheduling at regular intervals. Cron works particularly well when work needs to start on a specific day, hour, or minute. It works particularly poorly — or not at all — when work needs to start at the same time as, say, a rain-delayed baseball game. Despite the data team’s best efforts to add custom logic to the simple scheduler, the circumstances of the double-header confused it … and it simply stopped scheduling new work.\n\nIt wasn’t until the next day that an analyst realized the discrepancy when the data — critical numbers that formed the very basis of the team’s post-game analytics and recommendations — didn’t include a particularly memorable play. There were no warnings or red lights, because the process simply hadn’t run in the first place. And so a new, time-consuming activity was added to the data analytics stack: manually checking the database each morning to make sure everything had functioned properly.\n\nThis is not a story of catastrophic failure. In fact, I’m certain any engineer reading this can think of countless ways to solve this particular issue. But few engineers would find it a good use of time to sit around brainstorming every edge case in advance — nor is it even possible to proactively anticipate the billions of potential failures. As it is, there are enough pressing issues for engineers to worry about without dreaming up new errors.\n\nThe problem here, therefore, wasn’t the fact that an error occurred. There will always be errors, even in the most sophisticated infrastructures. The real problem was how limited the team’s options were to address it. Faced with a critical business issue and a deceptive cause, they were forced to waste time, effort, and talent in an effort to make sure this one unexpected quirk wouldn’t rear its head again.\n\nSo, what would be a better solution? I think it’s something akin to risk management for code or, more succinctly, negative engineering. Negative engineering is the time-consuming and sometimes frustrating work that engineers undertake to ensure the success of their primary objectives. If positive engineering is taken to mean the day-to-day work that engineers do to deliver productive, expected outcomes, then negative engineering is the insurance that protects those outcomes by defending them from an infinity of possible failures.\n\nAfter all, we must account for failure, even in a well-designed system. Most modern software incorporates some degree of major error anticipation or, at the very least, error resilience. Negative engineering frameworks, meanwhile, go a step further: They allow users to work with failure, rather than against it. Failure actually becomes a first-class part of the application.\n\nYou might think about negative engineering like auto insurance. Purchasing auto insurance won’t prevent you from getting into an accident, but it can dramatically reduce the burden of doing so. Similarly, having proper instrumentation, observability, and even orchestration of code can provide analogous benefits when something goes wrong.\n\n“Insurance as code” may seem like a strange concept, but it’s a perfectly appropriate description of how negative engineering tools deliver value: They insure the outcomes that positive engineering tools are used to achieve. That’s why features like scheduling or retries that seem toy-like — that is, overly simple or rudimentary — can be critically important: They’re the means by which users input their expectations into an insurance framework. The simpler they are (in other words, the easier it is to take advantage of them), the lower the cost of the insurance.\n\nIn applications, for example, retrying failed code is a critical action. Each step a user takes is reflected somewhere in code; if that code’s execution is interrupted, the user’s experience is fundamentally broken. Imagine how frustrated you’d be if every now and then, an application simply refused to add items to your cart, navigate to a certain page, or charge your credit card. The truth is, these minor refusals happen surprisingly often, but users never know because of systems dedicated to intercepting those errors and running the erroneous code again.\n\nTo engineers, these retry mechanisms may seem relatively simple: “just” isolate the code block that had an error, and execute it a second time. To users, they form the difference between a product that achieves its purpose and one that never earns their trust.\n\nIn mission-critical analytics pipelines, the importance of trapping and retrying erroneous code is magnified, as is the need for a similarly sophisticated approach to negative engineering. In this domain, errors don’t result in users missing items from their carts, but in businesses forming strategies from bad data. Ideally, these companies could quickly modify their code to identify and mitigate failure cases. The more difficult it is to adopt the right tools or techniques, the higher the “integration tax” for engineering teams that want to implement them. This tax is equivalent to paying a high premium for insurance.\n\nBut what does it mean to go beyond just a feature and provide insurance-like value? Consider the mundane activity of scheduling: A tool that schedules something to run at 9 a.m. is a cheap commodity, but a tool that warns you that your 9 a.m. process failed to run is a critical piece of infrastructure. Elevating commodity features by using them to drive defensive insights is a major advantage of using a negative engineering framework. In a sense, these “trivial” features become the means of delivering instructions to the insurance layer. By better expressing what they expect to happen, engineers can be more informed about any deviation from that plan.\n\nTo take this a step further, consider what it means to “identify failure” at all. If a process is running on a machine that crashes, it may not even have the chance to notify anyone about its own failure before it’s wiped out of existence. A system that can only capture error messages will never even find out it failed. In contrast, a framework that has a clear expectation of success can infer that the process failed when that expectation isn’t met . This enables a new degree of confidence by creating logic around the absence of expected success rather than waiting for observable failures .\n\nWhy negative engineering? Because stuff happens\n\nIt’s in vogue for large companies to proclaim the sophistication of their data stacks. But the truth is that most teams — even those performing sophisticated analytics — employ relatively simple stacks that are the product of a series of pragmatic decisions made under significant resource constraints. These engineers don’t have the luxury of time to both achieve their business objectives and contemplate every failure mode.\n\nWhat’s more, engineers hate dealing with failure, and no one actually expects their own code to fail. Compounded with the fact that negative engineering issues often arise from the most mundane features — retries, scheduling, and the like — it is easy to understand why engineering teams might decide to sweep this sort of work under the rug or treat it as Someone Else’s Problem. It might not seem worth the time and effort.\n\nTo the extent that engineering teams do recognize the issue, one of the most common approaches I’ve seen in practice is to produce a sculpture of band aids and duct tape: the compounded sum of a million tiny patches made without regard for overarching design. And trembling under the weight of that monolith is an overworked, under-resourced team of data engineers that spend all of their time monitoring and triaging their colleagues’ failed workflows.\n\nFAANG-inspired universal data platforms have been pitched as a solution to this problem, but fail to recognize the incredible cost of deploying far-reaching solutions at businesses still trying to achieve engineering stability. After all, none of them come packaged with FAANG-scale engineering teams . To avoid a high integration tax, companies should instead balance the potential benefits of a particular approach against the inconvenience of implementing it.\n\nBut here’s the rub: The tasks associated with negative engineering often arise from outside the software’s primary purpose, or in relation to external systems: rate-limited APIs, malformed data, unexpected nulls, worker crashes, missing dependencies, queries that time out, version mismatches, missed schedules, and so on. In fact, since engineers almost always account for the most obvious sources of error in their own code, these problems are more likely to come from an unexpected or external source .\n\nIt’s easy to dismiss the damaging potential of minor errors by failing to recognize how they will manifest in inscrutable ways, at inconvenient times, or on the screen of someone ill-prepared to interpret them correctly. A small issue in one vendor’s API, for instance, may trigger a major crash in an internal database. A single row of malformed data could dramatically skew the summary statistics that drive business decisions. Minor data issues can result in “butterfly effect” cascades of disproportionate damage.\n\nAnother story of simple fixes and cascading failures\n\nThe following story was originally shared with me as a challenge, as if to ask, “Great, but how could a negative engineering system possibly help with this problem?” Here’s the scenario: Another data team — this time at a high-growth startup — was managing an advanced analytics stack when their entire infrastructure suddenly and completely failed. Someone noticed that a report was full of errors, and when the team of five engineers began looking into it, a flood of error messages greeted them at almost every layer of their stack.\n\nStarting with the broken dashboard and working backward, the team discovered one cryptic error after another, as if each step of the pipeline was not only unable to perform its job, but was actually throwing up its hands in utter confusion. The team finally realized this was because each stage was passing its own failure to the next stage as if it were expected data, resulting in unpredictable failures as each step attempted to process a fundamentally unprocessable input.\n\nIt would take three days of digital archaeology before the team discovered the catalyst: the credit card attached to one of its SaaS vendors had expired . The vendor’s API was accessed relatively early in the pipeline, and the resulting billing error cascaded violently through every subsequent stage, ultimately contaminating the dashboard. Within minutes of that insight, the team resolved the problem.\n\nOnce again, a trivial external catalyst wreaked havoc on a business, resulting in extraordinary impact. In hindsight, the situation was so straightforward that I was asked not to share the name of the company or the vendor in question. (And let any engineer who has never struggled with a simple problem cast the first stone!) Nothing about this situation is complex or even difficult, conditional on being aware of the root problem and having the ability to resolve it. In fact, despite its seemingly unusual nature, this is actually a fairly typical negative engineering situation.\n\nA negative engineering framework can’t magically solve a problem as idiosyncratic as this one — at least, not by updating the credit card — but it can contain it. A properly instrumented workflow would have identified the root failure and prevented downstream tasks from executing at all, knowing they could only result in subsequent errors. In addition to dependency management, the impact of having clear observability is similarly extraordinary: In all, the team wasted 15 person-days triaging this problem. Having instant insight into the root error could have reduced the entire outage and its resolution to a few minutes at most, representing a productivity gain of over 99 percent.\n\nRemember: All they had to do was punch in a new credit card number.\n\n“Negative engineering” by any other name is still just as frustrating — and it’s had many other names. I recently spoke with a former IBM engineer who told me that, back in the ‘90s, one of IBM’s Redbooks stated that the “happy path” for any piece of software comprised less than 20 percent of its code; the rest was dedicated to error handling and resilience. This mirrors the proportion of time that modern engineers report spending on triaging negative engineering issues — up to an astounding 90 percent of their working hours.\n\nIt seems almost implausible: How can data scientists and engineers grappling with the most sophisticated analytics in the world be wasting so much time on trivial issues? But that’s exactly the nature of this type of problem. Seemingly simple issues can have unexpectedly time-destructive ramifications when they spread unchecked.\n\nFor this reason, companies can find enormous leverage in focusing on negative engineering. Given the choice of reducing model development time by 5% or reducing time spent tracking down errors by 5%, most companies would naively choose model development because of its perceived business value. But in a world where engineers spend 90% of their time on negative engineering issues, focusing on reducing errors could be 10 times as impactful. Consider that a 10% reduction of those negative engineering hours — from 90% of time down to 80% — would result in a doubling of productivity from 10% to 20%. That’s an extraordinary gain from a relatively minor action, perfectly mirroring the way such frameworks work.\n\nInstead of tiny errors bubbling up as major roadblocks, taking small steps to combat negative engineering issues can result in huge productivity wins.\n\nJeremiah Lowin is founder and CEO of Prefect.

ghosts - by Simon Sarris - The Map is Mostly Water","link":"https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/welcome-ghosts?s=r","content":"Lost in my dreams, I somehow cross at the traffic signals, bumping into street lamps or people, yet moving onward, exuding fumes of beer and grime, yet smiling, because my briefcase is full of books and that very night I expect them to tell me things about myself I do not know.\n\nWe are still in the quiet corner of the pub. We watch the waiter return and leave in silence. Do you know why we are here, and not elsewhere?\n\nThere are in this world certain lonely places: The mountaintop when a storm begins, a long drive under the obscurity of night, the unfinished attic of an old house as a child, the empty alley of an otherwise busy city. In the prolonged absence of others, our senses both sharpen and diffuse. We might begin to hear the subtle sounds that are forgotten in normal life. We might lose track of time. We become almost at risk of noticing things that are not really there. Solitude conspires with our surroundings to push the seen world and the unseen world closer together. It is no wonder that these settings are where we find ghosts.\n\nI tell you my friend: History is such a place. You are always alone exploring it, and it is always trying to look back at you.\n\nThe internet houses the greatest museum that the world has ever made. The humble archivists of every rank—from the employees of major institutions to the smallest town’s historical club—have belabored to digitize their treasure. The world’s vast collections of photographs, paintings, drawings, etchings, and letters sit here, among the internet’s drawers. Almost all are pieces that no earthly museum will ever display: They are too obscure, unattractive, ordinary, and above all simply too numerous for the possibility. Many articles, despite their new home, will only ever be seen by a handful of eyes.\n\nBut they are here, our collective inheritance. The shoebox under the earth’s crust, full of all the things we have forgotten.\n\nIt is a favorite occupation of mine to drift through this museum. I have seen hundreds of thousands of photographs, etchings, and paintings. I have studied a few. I am looking for the things that are not on any map of history, not in any index. Instead I wish to wonder myself with the sightings too casual to mention in written history. Historical writing often makes the mistake of focusing solely on presence, of what is here and why. But goaded by Zweig, I am looking for traces of absence, the unnamed things that once were, and are silently no longer. I want to see the ghosts.\n\nOf these visual articles I cannot offer a summary of any kind — no slideshow of the most profound or dramatic. I have long since lost their references. But they remain with me, they line the walls of my mind. I offer only fragments.\n\nUntil very recent times, much of the world was built out of informal spaces. The natural place for a shoemaker’s shop, for instance, is a modest extension of his home. To rent a storefront would be needlessly complex: he would have to find a space, contract with a landlord, pay rent, commute, etc. It may take fewer resources to simply build only what he needs onto his own house, but the important distinction that makes this space informal is not the expense. It is the permission-less nature of creating his own shop, the act of not negotiating with a landlord or any other authority, that makes the practice compelling. In many places to build such a small storefront today, even if it was permitted, would require so-called permits.\n\nA shoemaker may be hard to come by today, but the ghost is the shop: how it was built, how it functioned in life. The shoemaker’s shop—any shop—has become more absent.\n\nTime formalizes. Professionalizes. This brings advantages. But eventually, it conspires to remove the informal.\n\nThis is somewhat unfortunate. The work is now out of view. Why does this matter? Because genius is an interaction of people and places.\n\nIt is worth remembering from history that the bistro—the small Parisian restaurants serving home-cooked meals in very modest settings—like the cafe before it, was an invention. Many tales exist of its origin. Some say it was working-class landlords opening their kitchens for extra income. Others say it was the Auvergnats, immigrating to Paris from what is today central-south France, who first worked as rag-pickers, then wood and coal sellers, then metalworkers, who created small working-class restaurants to supplement their income. Either way, it was not planned or engineered, but simply not-disallowed. There were no rules in place to stop this invention.\n\nThe word bistro has changed meanings since the mid 1900s to mean something quite different, a much trendier place. And why? Partly fashion, but partly because the old model has crept into impossibility.\n\nPerhaps we don’t care, collectively, for this invention. Perhaps inexpensive restaurants are not worth the health risks, the noise, and all the other troubles that lead us to ensure their demise at the hands of fees and approval stamps.\n\nBut we do lose a meeting-place. And we again lose the interaction of people. By degrees our space for genius grows smaller. It is no wonder we spend so much time reading little texts on little screens, like this one. It is the last easy place for minds to meet. This is our pub, do you realize?\n\nMore important than the restaurant is the people, and not just the patrons.\n\nThere are a number of details worth studying in Krøyer’s painting, a favorite of mine. But the subject that enchants me the most are the woman and man behind the bar. They raise to me a thousand questions. Are they the owners? Is this the first floor of someone’s house? Is this a semi-retired couple’s source of income? (How was this place built? Where did the materials come from? How much does it cost to operate? How difficult was it for the owner to open such a place? Could they have done it if they were illiterate? What are all barriers to opening it?)\n\nWhat are the options for a semi-retired couple today to do something like this? Have we ensured that seniors can still act upon this world, interact with it, in meaningful ways? I pray you understand that this is not a thought about restaurants, but people. The fact is that thousands of new barriers have made this too expensive or complex. Such an osteria no longer exists. The seniors are instead placed in homes. The place is a ghost, and we treat the people as ghosts.\n\nIf you create a good product or process, and don’t constrain yourself too tightly, it will have other uses that you will discover later. This is true in almost every field. There are a million examples in business, a compact one is the founding of cosmetics company, Avon: A door-to-door bookseller in the late 1800s used perfume samples to try and interest customers. The samples were more popular than the books, so he switched to selling perfume.\n\nAnother is the story of YouTube, which began life as a dating site that failed terribly. No one wanted to upload video introductions of themselves, not even after the founders offered $100 for participants to do so. But the video uploading platform created in 2005 was very good, so they simply let anyone upload anything, and the users, not the website creators, found its real uses. The YouTube we know today was an invention that founders let happen, by way of a permission-free set of users.\n\nThese stories are not so different from each-other, or the invention of the bistro. There is a large danger in over-engineering your plan, and failing to respond to local conditions. There is great bounty in remaining sensitive to context. We understand this individually. Do we understand it collectively? Are we as a civilization still letting uses be discovered?\n\nSoftware is attractive to many, myself included, precisely because of its permission-less nature. But instead of praising software, we should think very hard about the ossification of the physical world. On a grand scale, we have come to decide what can be done and what cannot be done, have decided how difficult to make building things that were once permission-less, and have even decided what the nature of work looks like . Ever-rigid systematizing damages the softest fringes of society the most, the tender growth and the deepest roots. The young are more confined to pre-defined destinies. The old are simply confined. A mounting complexity erodes.\n\nI wonder: What were the tradeoffs we wanted to make? Are they really the ones we have made?

All Marxists Now - by David Phelps - Three quarks","link":"https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/were-all-marxists-now?s=r","content":"We're All Marxists Now Could the web3 era of mass hyperfinancialization, anti-regulation, and artificial scarcity actually be... Marxist?\n\nI originally delivered the following as a lecture for Crypto, Culture, and Society , which has published this article as well ( here ). Sara Campbell and I adapted the lecture into the piece below.\n\n“In one sense, we are all Keynesians now; in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian.” — Milton Friedman, 1966\n\nThere’s a lot of reasons it’s perverse to say that web3 has made us all Marxists, but perhaps none moreso than the fact that web3 OGs really hate Karl Marx.\n\nTake, for example, Nick Szabo: scholar, cryptographic guru, and proto-bitcoin inventor, occasionally rumored to be Satoshi, who has bemoaned Marxism for fomenting closed societies. Or to quote Szabo himself, “how fucking pathological can a diseased brain become?”\n\nLikewise, take Ameen Soleimani, creator of Moloch DAO, RAI, and SpankChain—truly one of the most innovative and influential minds in the space—who has gone on record not only agreeing with Szabo, but arguing that “America has been invaded by the Marxist mind-virus” by KGB psyops. “When poor people are told what they want to hear—that they are equal to rich people,” writes Soleimani, “the seed of social unrest is planted.”\n\nBut it’s not just right-wing crypto figures who think web3 is fundamentally, well, unmarxist; crypto’s hyper-marketization means many leftists understand crypto as an accelerated form of capitalism as well. “There are respects in which cryptoeconomics also resembles an opposite of the commons: the enclosure,” Nathan Schenider wrote recently , as “what was once held in common become subdivided into ownable, tradable assets.” For Schneider, this hyperfinancialization takes “things previously difficult or impossible to buy or sell, from cryptographic computing power to real estate in digital games,” and gives them value by making them artificially scarce. It privatizes what could have been freely available to all.\n\nMeanwhile, Cory Doctorow, arguably the most important technologist of the left, has accused DeFi of being “Shadow Banking 2.0,” creating massive risk for the economy while enriching the 1%. “I don't care how distributed the banks are if all the money is owned by the same number of billionaires,” he writes. (Indeed, about .01% of bitcoin owners represent 27% of wealth.)\n\nSo how blue are the cryptopills that would have us thinking web3 could possibly be Marxist? How could we even arrive at that conclusion?\n\nWell, let me try to answer first by way of example, or rather, another overarching question: could communism be… DAOs?\n\nBack in October, I ran an experiment to retweet three passages of Marx’s German Ideology by replacing the word “communism” with “DAO.” You can judge for yourself how well it worked.\n\nHere’s the original: “The communists do not oppose egoism to selflessness or selflessness to egoism… they are very well aware that egoism, just as much as selflessness, is a necessary form of the self-assertion of individuals… Throughout history, the \"general interest\" is created by individuals who are defined as \"private persons.\"”\n\nNote the tension here: the collective only operates as well as it fulfills the self-interested needs and desires of its individual members without ever costing them their sovereignty.\n\nAnd that tension is a recurring one.\n\nThe original: “The real intellectual wealth of the individual depends entirely on the wealth of his real connections. Only then will the separate individuals be liberated from the various national and local barriers… All-round dependence will be transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these powers, which have till now governed men as powers completely alien to them.” Again, note the paradoxical emphasis on individual sovereignty as the basis for collective liberation.\n\nThat paradox is the point, too, of one final Marxist tweet.\n\nThe original: “The modern state, the rule of the bourgeoisie, is based on freedom of labour. Freedom of Labor is free competition of the workers among themselves. [By contrast,] free activity for the Communists is the creative manifestation of life arising from the free development of all abilities of the whole person.”\n\nOnce again, we sense the same tension. True collective freedom means liberation of the individual to do as they please and are able.\n\nBut note, more broadly, that there is a tension at all—that is, that “Marxism” is not quite so reducible to pat solutions or huff-and-puff sloganeering, nevermind the horrors of 20th century state socialism. For when we understand Marxism not as doctrine but dialectics, a series of tensions and paradoxes, we can understand one of its main points of value: that it’s a framework for questions that may not have any answer at all.\n\nSo for the purpose of this piece, we’ll cover three questions posed by Marx, all encompassing the tension between individual sovereignty and collective collaboration that underlie the three main categories of web3 right now: NFTs, DeFi, and DAOs.\n\nIt’s so obvious a question that it’s challenging to answer: in his writings, does Marx advocate for the abolishment of property and ownership generally? Or does he advocate for the redistribution of ownership to the proletariat — that is, so they can own the means of production?\n\nThe question even runs through a document as doctrinaire as “The Communist Manifesto,” which toggles tortuously between wanting to eradicate property and wanting to hand it over to workers. “The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally,” Marx and Engels write in The Communist Manifesto , only to add a few lines later, “in this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.”\n\nThis tension haunts the text. Marx and Engels try to paper over it by explaining at various points that communism is just the abolition of private property (not property generally, not to worry union rank-and-filers!), and that the real point is dispossessing the bourgeoisie of their ill-gotten gains. Yet they have no great answer for whether they would destroy workers’ property except to answer, defensively, that it’s a moot point given that history has done exactly that: “the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.”\n\nThis is, clearly, a rhetorical sidestep to avoid the question of worker ownership—because for all “The Communist Manifesto”’s cavalcades of anti-property posturing, we can see Marx’s paradox. For workers to own the means of production means getting rid of ownership as we know it. “With the abolition of the basis of private property,” he writes in The German Ideology , “men get exchange, production, the mode of their mutual relation, under their own control again.”\n\nThe contrary, Marx writes, is a system where “trade rules the whole world through the relation of supply and demand – a relation which allots fortune and misfortune to men, sets up empires and overthrows empires, causes nations to rise and to disappear.” Only Marx would fear the tyranny not of kings, but of… supply and demand. Supply and demand is, in other words, a tyranny of misvaluing the things that matter most to us, whether that’s food or love. NFT critics will recognize the sentiment here: supply and demand assigns values to items not according to what they *mean* to us but rather simply for their scarcity in the market. Web3-native, it seems, Marx is not.\n\nAnd yet. What happens when workers control the means of production?\n\n“As soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.”\n\nThe most important means of production is not a factory, it turns out. It’s *time*—and more importantly, our own sense of self that comes from having free time at all. These are what gain us our sovereignty to live the lives we want to lead, to act as hunters, fishers, herdsmen, and critics, without ever being hunters, fishers, herdsmen, and critics, defining ourselves by the role we play in profit creation.\n\nBut notice again that there’s a tension here about the role of the individual and collective—if we’re all doing whatever we want, how is society collectively running? Who is working on the sewers and taking out the trash? Perhaps these are unnecessary if we live in small sustainable communes; Marx only hints that “society regulates the general production.”\n\nBut who is this society?\n\nRather than try to answer that question directly, I wonder if we can reframe it in more familiar terms. For we might argue that this tension—whether to abolish ownership or enable workers to own the means of production—actually reflects a deeper one. Should we aspire to sovereignty as individuals to own our own identity, or in today’s terms, our data and reputation? Or would we each be better off if we relinquished this sovereignty as selfish so that we could better support the collective needs of each other and society?\n\nActually, we can boil down these questions even more to a profound tension at the heart of web3:\n\nDo we want ownership over the products of our labor, or do we want them to be open-source for anyone to use?\n\nOne way to understand this tension is to understand the creator economy over the past decade. Step back, and we can see the creator economy as a kind of progenitor of web3 culture, not only as a product of permissionless, user-generated content (TikTok, Twitter) but of a general move towards a freelance economy and the valorization of the solopreneur, that single individual who works on whatever they like and gets paid for their own work.\n\nThat might sound as though the creator economy has shifted us culturally towards a belief that artists should own the means of production: what is a TikToker if not a Hollywood celebrity who owns the means of production? what are hype houses if not proto-DAOs? But then we remember that the creator economy is actually the product of making work for free to prioritize engagement at scale over the monetization of “100 True Fans.”\n\nStep back farther, and we can see that the creator economy is really the culmination of the failures of the gig economy that’s gained dominance over 40 years with the promise of worker sovereignty and a reality of worker isolation. Initially, freelancing was an attractive proposition for corporations to pay as they needed—or rather, to pay as little as they needed, as David Harvey pointed out in The Condition of Postmodernity: “Employers have taken advantage of weakened union power and the pools of surplus labourers to push for much more flexible work regimes and labour contracts.” The irony is that the creator economy has also proven to be the undoing of those traditional corporations as the hierarchies of the corporate ladder have vanished before a new ideology of working for yourself.\n\nBut in a world where 35% of American workers are gig workers , this promise of being a fisherman, hunter, and critic as we please has also meant an abandonment of structures for steady compensation and support for liability as freelancers have fewer safety nets and less recourse to worker rights than ever — because they’re on their own.\n\nLikewise, the creator economy has promised us a Marx-like vision of anyone successfully becoming an artist, but only by operating through platforms that extract excessive profit from the workers who make them successful. What’s true for Uber drivers is true for TikTokers. This, we might say, has been the cost of freelancers being open-source: their work is used freely by anyone, while the platforms they operate through have remained siloed and deeply monetized.\n\nPut another way: freelancers got the open-source, but platforms got the ownership.\n\nHey.com exec says Apple is acting like ‘gangsters,’ rejecting App Store updates and demanding cut of sales\n\n“I thought you were supposed to wrap the threats in euphemisms or something. But it was pretty clear.”\n\nSo what’s the answer? Web3 is, arguably, a response to the polarized failures of the corporate ladder and the economy, of siloed companies on one side and open-market freelancing on the other. And this is where we return to Marx. Because the promise of independent sovereignty to hunt and fish as we please will only work if there is, indeed, a “society” to “regulate the general production” as well. We can only own our work if we’re also willing to give it up to collective benefit to provide for each other.\n\nDAOs, clearly, are one answer here that we’ll return to in a bit—a kind of consensual-state-as-company that lets us earn fully for our work while sharing it permissionlessly and abolishing individual ownership over it.\n\nBut the simpler model is an NFT.\n\nOn the one hand, NFTs represent creators finally getting paid directly for their work. On the other hand, this ownership is clearly a social construct over an infinitely replicable jpeg that is very much open source.\n\nIn other words, NFTs give us one vision of what it can mean for creators to own the means of production (their art) and capture the full value that they produce, even while the work itself is not private property at all but open to all.\n\nNFTs abolish ownership to enable it for creators—for workers.\n\nThe question of ownership is a much larger one than just assets. It’s also a question of whether we should own our own money away from the power of centralized institutions like banks and even governments that have used it to fund everything from subprime mortgages to war. Or does that open the way for what we might call roller coaster sovereignty—that is, massive financial abuse, money-laundering, hacks, con artists, and extreme volatility without government regulation?\n\nIn other words, are we our own best financial custodians?\n\nMore technically, what we’re asking is whether liquid capital is at the heart of capitalism’s contradictions—or actually the solution to capitalism’s deepest problems? This liquid capital is what Marx in the Grundrisse calls “circulating capital,” that is, capital which can easily be liquified as cash and just as easily converted into goods. Such liquid capital, Marx writes, “is indifferent to every specific form, and can shed or adopt any one of them as equivalent incarnations.” In other words, like a kind of ghost assuming the form of the goods it possesses, liquid capital can take on any shape, and isn’t constrained to a use case or even a specific territory.\n\nFor contrast, let’s isolate some key qualities of *fixed* capital, which can’t be liquified, to see why liquidity might help solve some of the major challenges of capitalism.\n\nRequires extensive investment to build and keep overstocked\n\nAbsorbs surplus value (companies charging more for goods than what they cost to make)\n\nNotice how fixed capital is at the heart of some the most predatory aspects of capitalism historically: overcharging for work, underpaying workers, and continually servicing exorbitant loans for money that doesn’t yet exist but will require the economy to produce more and more money with more and more production in order to meet rates of interest.\n\nLiquid capital, on the other hand, doesn’t have these issues.\n\nCan be used to represent any item or good\n\nCan take on any use\n\nCompletely mobile, liquid capital doesn’t face the friction and costs of time and place such as decay, overstocking, and upfront costs that demand huge amounts of money that must be returned at a premium later.\n\nAnd so, when we define liquid capital this way, we might think of it as something else: digital money.\n\nCan be used to represent any item or good\n\nCan take on any use\n\nIn other words, could digital money, or cryptocurrency, be the solution to the physical world of scarcity?\n\nNot so fast. There’s also an argument that this “pure capital,” this capital untethered from the real-world or actual use, is valuable because it’s what facilitates the systems of loans, surplus value, overstocking, and all the rest. As David Harvey writes about liquid capital in A Companion to Marx’s Capital, it “emerges when money is put into circulation in order to get more money.” Its purpose is breeding more capital, keeping us tethered to a world where we constantly have to work below wage to produce more value to service loans for money that doesn’t yet exist.\n\nSo what happens when totally liquid capital that knows no barriers of time, space, government regulation, or TradFi rails can be deployed instantaneously anywhere in the world however anyone wants? Does operating online enable an economy in which liquid capital doesn’t need to service fixed capital for the first time ever? Or as NFT critics have claimed, does it mean we need to recreate the scarcity dynamics underpinning supply and demand economics in order for digital items to have value?\n\nTo put it another way, are we creating shadow banking 2.0 with all the perils of unregulated criminality, or are we creating Occupy Wall Street 2.0?\n\nRecently, Hilary J. Allen has made a quite compelling case that an economy of liquid currency results in capitalism on steroids. Endless liquidity means overleveraging is easier than ever, and to make things even more financially perilous, there’s no federal bank to prop up cascading margin calls that can result. If every transformative technology has experienced massive financial bubbles that brought down the economy when expectations outpaced innovation, we can only speculate just how truly horrific a crash would be when the next technology itself enables massive, unregulated lending.\n\nFor we can also say that liquid capital enables financial sovereignty since we no longer need intermediaries benefitting from our money. Financial sovereignty, it turns out, applies to anyone who’s ever kept their money in a bank just as well as it does to workers. To return to the labor paradigm, we might imagine that just as workers get paid far below the value they provide to factories, we depositors get paid far below the value we provide to banks historically—despite also having to pay governments to bail them out.\n\nDeFi is predicated on the fact that we no longer have to pay banks for their failures without getting paid for their successes. Because now, we can serve the function of lenders ourselves. In a traditional banking paradigm, you would deposit $1 in a bank that the bank would loan out to someone else, so that you and the other lender would each have $1, with the bank effectively earning off your money by generating $2 in the economy while making you an unwitting, un-consensual, and unearning lender to someone else. (I’m simplifying, but this is the principle of money multipliers and bank runs .) That’s simply not possible in DeFi, where you can either provide liquidity yourself to markets or, if you like, deposit $1 and get a synthetic token representing its worth. Now there’s $2 in the economy as well, but one is fully collateralized, and the other belongs to you.\n\nThis is what we mean when we say DeFi is backed. While it’s clear we’re heading towards a future of undercollateralized loans and crypto generating loans for fixed capital in the physical world, financial sovereignty has given us volatility because it’s enabled us to be our own lenders and market makers—as well as losers in the absence of a state.\n\nWhich begs the question: perhaps we should create money out of thin air to stabilize economic systems? And that leads us to our final section, on DAOs.\n\nTo invest with any expectation of return is to put money in the world and hope more comes out—which raises the question, from where? What is it that generates that new value?\n\nExploitation of the poor and expropriation of the land are two answers, and while Marx’s legacy is often intertwined with the former, his major focus throughout much of Das Kapital is on a third: debt. Debt is, for Marx, fictional capital: an obligation for future money that doesn’t officially exist but that debt itself wills into being. To give an example I gave last year in “Ray Dalio, Marxist,” if I loan my friend $5 and they write me an IOU, I can now potentially use that IOU as collateral or even currency with other friends—so that $10 now exists in place of $5, and even more if we count interest.\n\nWe might expect Marx to decry the whole system of capitalist enterprise as a charade built on IOUs that would collapse the economy were they ever to be serviced. But in fact, Marx makes a crucial distinction here: for Marx, investments in companies—stocks—represent real capital, precisely because they are not IOUs that can “exist twice” as loans and currencies.\n\nThe stocks of railways, mines, navigation companies, and the like, represent actual capital, namely, the capital invested and functioning in such enterprises, or the amount of money advanced by the stockholders for the purpose of being used as capital in such enterprises. This does not preclude the possibility that these may represent pure swindle. But this capital does not exist twice, once as the capital-value of titles of ownership (stocks) on the one hand and on the other hand as the actual capital invested, or to be invested, in those enterprises. — Marx, Das Kapital, III.29\n\nNote the difference between debts and investments. With debt, your $5 loan will always be worth $5 (plus interest), so your IOU can easily become currency or collateral. With investments, however, your $5 can’t be treated as $5 whenever you like: it will only be worth whatever the market deems it’s worth, which can go up or down over time. In other words, investment is different from debt because it doesn’t guarantee you a return of any kind that would require the money to exist twice, first as a quantity to be repaid (the IOU) and second as a quantity being used or lended out (the loan itself).\n\nEven more importantly, investments are not what Marx calls “illusory capital” because they are not “interest-bearing capital,” which Marx defines as nothing more than “an accumulation of claims on production, an accumulation of the market-price.” For the perfect embodiment of such “illusory capital,” Marx points us to state bonds: because bonds require a repayment at interest that they can’t actually be used to generate themselves, they’re effectively creating money out of thin air. (For anyone who associates Marx with specter of 20th century state socialism or believes that he at any point advocates for an all-powerful government to regulate enterprise, the shade he throws at states here should set us straight.)\n\nHowever, there’s a slight catch in public markets that becomes a bigger catch in private markets. Because where does the valuation of that stock come from? Well, it comes from the expected future returns of a company that we hope will do well.\n\nSo we are effectively making money out of thin air. If I invest $2M in your company at a $20M valuation, my $2M is real capital, but the other $18M was just created out of nowhere as a mythical entity we hope will earn its value due to future monetization. These valuations are, like debt, claims on future production.\n\nThat catch doesn’t matter for Marx because there has never traditionally been a way to tap into these claims or use them as capital: as long as the IOU can’t be traded as its own currency, the money doesn’t exist twice. But in DAOs, it suddenly does — because now we’ve replaced stocks with tokens that we can use to trade, buy, or invest (assuming the SEC lets us).\n\nBut there’s another, even bigger point at play — DAOs let *anyone* anywhere create tokens that are essentially claims on future value, and raise capital from whomever they like. Now anybody can have the benefits of illusory capital without the downside of actually having to pay it back with interest.\n\nWe can start to see the risks that DAOs represent to financial systems. Many of these investments will not return their valuation, while the democratization of finance without proper education offers massive opportunities for fraudulent or even failed projects to take advantage of investors who can’t diligence them.\n\nBut even so, by letting us create our *own* currency, DAOs can also help us tap into innovation and investment for our projects in ways that never could happen before web3. Owning your work is one thing. Being able to fund the kind of work you want to do is another — and it’s what enables genuine workers collectives to control funding and dissolve the barriers of labor and capital. Because now you can imagine DAOs “investing” in each other by swapping tokens under agreement to support one another’s projects. In place of a traditional investment ecosystem with capital on one side (investors) and labor on the other (founders), DAO-to-DAO token-swaps mean each side represents both.\n\nDAOs, in other words, embody all the tensions we’ve discussed above: between workers having sovereignty and giving it up to a collective, between liquid capital enabling financial self-empowerment and driving us towards a world in which we live in the illusion of only seeing future investment and returns, between the real capital of investing in a project we create and the illusory capital of using that money to fund future value. If there are no clear answers to these paradoxes, these questions, there is at least the optionality of multiple choices.\n\nAnd it’s that optionality that seems peculiarly, well, Marxist. In an era of massive hyperfinancialization and billion-dollar venture funds, this is perhaps the real point of DAOs, the real reason that in the shadows of corporations and the gig economy, even the VCs all talk like Marxists now: web3’s great aim is not just to let builders take financial sovereignty over what they’re building, but to give everyone the optionality to build according to their own desires.\n\nSpecial thanks to Li Jin and to Bhaumik Patel and Tom White for notes and edits.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

hate everybody including you' - by Shaun Usher","link":"https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/i-hate-everybody-including-you?s=r","content":"Admittedly it’s thin, but there is definitely a silver lining to the pandemic: for the best part of a year we have all been granted a bulletproof excuse to turn down pretty much any invitation, and I, for one, am grateful. Before long, however, we will need to restart the excuse generator and begin declining things awkwardly again. For that reason I want to revisit a subject I’ve touched on before, and have gathered together a list of knock-backs pulled from the letters of others. Some are tactful and eloquent; others are entirely free of both. All are admirable.\n\nThank you for your invitation to host a fundraising dinner in the private room of a top London restaurant.\n\nI am sorry, but I do not wish to accept the honorary degree you have offered me. I already have one degree, honestly earned, from Princeton. At the commencement when I received it, I remember watching the honorary degrees being conferred and feeling that an \"honorary\" degree was a debasement of the idea of a degree that confirms that certain work has been accomplished.\n\nRichard Feynman | Letter to Robert Boheen, 1967 | The Letters of Richard P. Feynman\n\nA dinner! How horrible! I am to be made the pretext for killing all those wretched animals! Thank you for nothing. Blood sacrifices are not in my line.\n\nI can imagine myself blurbing a book in which Brian Aldiss, predictably, sneers at my work, because then I could preen myself on my magnanimity. But I cannot imagine myself blurbing a book, the first of the series, which not only contains no writing by women, but the tone of which is so self-contentedly, exclusively male, like a club, or a locker room. That would not be magnanimity, but foolishness. Gentlemen, I just don’t belong here.\n\nUrsula Le Guin | Letter to John Radziewicz, 1987 | More Letters of Note\n\nThanks for your letter inviting me to join the committee of the Arts and Sciences for Eisenhower.\n\nI cannot be of any use to you and your students nowadays, alas, since, at 84, I resemble nothing so much as an iguana, hate travel, and have nothing to say. I might as well send a spent Roman candle in my stead.\n\nI have declined to go to Mrs Fosters and to Miss Martineau – and now I decline to go to you. But – listen! Do not think that I throw your kindness away or that it fails of doing the good you desire. On the contrary – the feeling expressed in your letter – proved by your invitation goes right home where you would wish it to go and heals as you would wish it to heal.\n\nThank you for your letter of 10th January. I would be useless at this debate primarily because I have been dead for 24 years now. Apart from that, I hate scientists and I hate artists. In fact, I hate everybody including you, do tell them that is why I’m not at the debate.\n\nThank you for offering me this honour: I am very pleased. But for some time now I have been wondering, \"But where is this British Empire?\" Surely, there isn't one. And now I see that I am not the only one saying the same.\n\nThere is something ruritannical about honours given in the name of a non-existent Empire.\n\nAnd there is another thing. When young I did my best to undo that bit of the British Empire I found myself in: that is, old Southern Rhodesia.\n\nAnd surely there is something unlikeable about a person, when old, accepting honours from a institution she attacked when young?\n\nAnd yet, how pleasant to be a dame! I would adore it. Dame of what?\n\nDame of Britain? Dame of the British Islands? Dame of the British Commonwealth? Dame of ....? Never mind.\n\nPlease forgive my churlishness. I am sorry, I really am.\n\nYour letter to me is based on the assumption that there exists some reason or need for you to interview or write about me. I do, as you rightly suppose, occasionally eat something and (as a result) go to the dentist but that is some way from agreeing to be shat on by a stranger.\n\nAfter five years, you have again been kind enough to ask me to luncheon. The reason for this is that I have just published a successful book: the reason I have had a successful book is that I do not go out and waste my time and energy, but work hard, morning and afternoon. If I accept your kind invitation, I shall have to leave off earlier in the morning, and shall be too tired to work in the afternoon. Then my next book will not be such a success, and you will not ask me to luncheon; or, at best, less often. So that, under these circumstances, I am sure you will agree it is wiser for me not to accept your present kind invitation.\n\nCertainly you can say No to the David Frost Show! If you could make the No a bit insulting so much the better. Perhaps you could put it that Mr Greene wouldn’t dream of appearing on a David Frost Show!\n\nGraham Greene | Letter to Michael Korda, 13 May 1978 | A Life in Letters\n\nYou can of course decline, but please consider supporting this newsletter for a few pounds a month so I can spend even more time sending you things like this.

But what if it's making new ones in its image?\n\nI lost religion at some point in the middle of a conversation with a crush on AOL Instant Messenger. I was 15, and if you had asked me if I was in love with her, I would have denied it with a defensiveness bordering on desperation. But my face might have given me up when she asked me the question, “Do u believe in god?,” and I blanched.\n\nFor this was me at 15: attending Bible Study every week, teaching Sunday School, Altar boy in our old stone Church, an only child who had spent nights for years talking only to his mother, his cat, and God. And what did I know of her at 16? Psychedelic sympathies, like everyone I was becoming drawn to, a shared love of Odyssey and Oracle, an ability to articulate her desires that nobody else in our town of 17 churches seemed to share.\n\nI mean that I admired her, and when I tried to strategically deflect the question back to her, I already knew what she would say. “No, u?” Well, “me neither,” I replied nonchalantly, trying to convince myself that my statement would relieve me of divine scrutiny for what I was saying. But in that moment of blasphemous typing, I had shed all that I knew about myself and the world and emerged as my true self: a lost and lovelorn teen, a counterculture striver, a sinner in the eyes of a deadbeat God. Some combination of a high-school crush, perpetually unsated desire to be cool, and extremely weak moral constitution made me understand that my two words would be worth the price of lifelong heresy.\n\nIn retrospect, though, it’s unlikely I ever would have stripped my Puritanism if not for the internet. My newfound apostasy found me bathed in the white-blue hues of the new ethereal—the AOL homepage—and facing the glow of this duller heaven, I could only blink.\n\nWhoever or whatever I was becoming, the internet was making me in its image. The few keystrokes it took to fall from grace had long been preordained. God was dead, and AIM had killed him.\n\nThe internet is one of the only religions in which we get to pretend we’re gods. Not good gods, exactly, but gods nonetheless.\n\nThe first point to make there is that the internet is fundamentally pantheistic. In this, the internet is really a public forum for a cultural imagination that has long worshiped conflicting deities at once: pastors and politicians, celebrities and cartoons. For those of us who have grown up online, we’ve lived in rickety versions of the metaverse for as long as we’ve been alive, raised biculturally across analog and digital worlds, forging separate-but-entangled identities on each. We’re the children of split custody ideologies—of socialism and Star Wars, poetry and code, the independence of working hard and the independence of hardly working.\n\nOn the internet, each of these figures and ideologies can come into contact under the jurisdiction of our moral—and moralizing—eyes, in a kind of Dante-like metaverse. It is a place where the occasionally richest man in the world can trade up his social capital by becoming, of all things, a dog-promoter. And it is a place where, whether you like it or not, you will be tempted into sentencing him morally for doing such a thing. You will like it or dislike it, but above all, you’ll perform that modern form of religious censure: the vibe-check.\n\nThe second is that the internet is a religion we get to shape and star in in real time. It’s not only characters and the celebrities playing them who interact with one another in performances straddling the lines of fiction and documentary. It’s us. Everyday, every one of us on the internet has a casino-shot of living out A Star is Born if we can just figure out the right permutation of 280 characters. If we’re good at the game, this game of becoming a God, we’ll do whatever it takes to will our best or worst selves into existence—enjoining our aspirational selves to be true so that we can give the people what we want to hear. The price to be original is, paradoxically, cliche.\n\nOn the internet, we can create our own religions, if we’re inclined, by creating ourselves in whatever image we like. Online, at least, we can tell ourselves that our bodies don’t keep the score: that we can present as we’d like to be seen, that we can form collective selves dissolving physical bounds, that we can move our bodies conscientiously, comfortable with all positions, never flinching when triggered by unremembered traumas. The narrative of who we are is ours to control, relinquish, and share.\n\nBut most importantly, we tell it about our God-self, a character who is a truer and falser us, an us we can perform more convincingly, with better lighting and skins. The ultimate myth we tell ourselves, then, is one about the role of myth itself: that we not only need to write our lives as storytellers but recite the lines as actors. That we wrote the lines ourselves. That they are somehow not banal. (We repeat them until they are.)\n\nTo live in this constant state of make-believe—not quite believing in our performances, nor in the script we enact, nor in the fact that we wrote it—is simply the state of being oneself online, of being the product of schizophrenic cultural wars, of growing up in the dueling shadows of God and Bowser. It is to live in a state in which we ourselves can play either but would, generally, prefer to play the former.\n\nI joked recently that crypto is the great religion of our time:\n\nA simpler way to say that is that the religions operating as moral systems offer positive incentives for good behavior (prosperity here or hereafter) and negative ones for bad behavior (damnation for eternity). These are the core structuring devices of the Dante metaverse, though they’re articulated with annoying precision across religions. But the bigger point is that these incentives are only possible because they presume that our actions will be legible on a divine ledger—that there is an all-seeing eye to judge us in the first place for following its laws. God’s light doesn’t just give us vision; it traps us in his as well.\n\nOr to put that another way: the most successful religions are, historically, gamified. A life battling moral temptation is, essentially, a choose-your-own-ending story, one that forces you to pick your team, complete quests, and try to win a prize (salvation, reincarnation, and the love of a Laura or Beatrice). Virtue doesn’t define the essence of our soul so much as it stands as an economic reward. Good karma must be earned, just as nirvana can only be attained by following the Noble Eightfold Path. To these moral incentives, Islam added a penalty as well: those who didn’t convert would be taxed or conscripted . The rules of the game here are the laws of the universe, as well as, occasionally, the laws of man.\n\nWhat differentiates a religion from a game, then, except the spectrum between optionality and determinism, between make-believe and belief? It might make more sense to reverse the formulation, then—to say not only that successful religions are gamified but that successful games are religionized. The great games, from chess to Dungeons and Dragons, operate as minor religions with a cast of god-like avatars imbued with talismanic power, as well as endless narrative permutations from a few simple rules. Religions and games are, if you like, types of generative art that inscribe broadly archetypical characters within a set of limited scenarios in order to force big questions about how one acts and what that action means—whether it’s a reflection of one’s character or an opportunity to define it.\n\nIn that framework, it is not surprising to see infinitely reproducible information gain great value as a luxury when packaged as an NFT. You might say that the NFT isn’t real, that its value is the product of a mass delusion of consumers working within the same codes to attain status from one another, but people have said the same of God, religion, and games for centuries. NFTs are snarky, of course, deriving immense value from serving as fuck-yous to value both in their free distribution and frequent artlessness. They’re the totems of an internet-native religion with the same properties as all online viral content: contrarian, attention-seeking, community-cohering, altogether gorgeous trash.\n\nIf nothing else, the internet is good at allowing us to find others who will validate our banal interests, the sort we’d usually want to hide from our families and neighbors, and elevate them into objects of veneration. The internet is designed to help us trivialize worshipful affairs, just as it’s designed to help us worship trivial things. For better and for worse, it lets us design our own rules to the game.\n\nStill, we might wonder whether those rules are dictated by historical imperatives, just as they’ve always been. An all-seeing God, an eye that gets us to comport with its expectations of moral decency, isn’t necessary in every religion, but is useful as an alibi for the surveillance state. Religions centered around single spirits—Hinduism, Christianity, Islam—arose as the product of imperial states that worked to centralize disparate regions around a shared authority; in a way, monotheism replaced polytheism at the same moment that empires replaced local states.\n\nBut what if those ancient pantheistic religions suggest a more intrinsic human need to believe in multiple authorities at once? And what if, beneath the surface, we’ve always been pantheistic? After all, Hinduism can’t exactly qualify as monotheistic , and even Christianity typically fragments into a Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. The fundamental polytheism of the internet might, in that sense, reflect our own promiscuous desires for the divine. At the very least, it might reflect the ways that the empires of the past 2000 years were possibly just a historical anomaly that are just dissolving, now, into online microcities and subcommunities.\n\nIn two quotes, we can see why the attention economy online has the power to decimate all other religions.\n\n“What makes Twitter so axiomatically hellish? It’s a place where even the most well-intentioned attempts at intellectually honest conversation inevitably devolve into misunderstanding and mutual contempt, like the fruit that crumbles into ash in the devils’ mouths in book 10 of Paradise Lost. It amplifies our simultaneous interdependency and alienation, the overtaking of meaningful political life by the triviality of the social.”\n\nAnd then David Hoffman, writing in Bankless :\n\n“Now that we are on the periphery of the metaverse, it seems that Ethereum isn’t going to stop growing until it consumes all of our attention. If Ethereum doesn’t interest you yet, just wait. It’ll find a way. Something cool on Ethereum will be built, and that thing will be the subject matter of your homies’ group chat, or your family’s dinner table conversation.\n\nEthereum will accept everything that you put into it, and it will still have room for more.\n\nThe more attention you put towards Ethereum, the more financial rewards you tend to find, which makes “taking a break” have a significant amount of opportunity cost, and hence why this industry is generally a one-way street.\n\nThose who enter do not leave.”\n\nThere is another term for this kind of religion—a casino. The slot-machine mechanics of Twitter and Ethereum both compel us into paying attention and lending our ears in a gambler’s hope of some return-on-attentiveness. They merge, perfectly, in NFTs, which are essentially Ethereum-disguised-as-jpegs that gain status both as images and objects of discussion almost exclusively on Twitter. Scrolling Twitter is the new form of prayer: an endless state of hoping for miracles by simply waiting around, alert.\n\nIf scrolling the internet dissolves us from material concern, well, then, that only makes the internet more powerful as a religion. Likewise, if the people we follow can have their status visibly denominated in the number of followers and Eth-value of their profile pic, well, then, that only makes it easier to know who to worship. And even amidst all the talk of decentralization, it’s the act of worship that helps us find our strongest communities. We get to create our own religions in real-time, in direct conjunction with the creators we worship.\n\nReligion, like every other industry, now requires an interactive social layer to be successful.\n\nSo it is surely brute stupidity, if not a gambler’s self-justification, that I think we can use the internet to find paradise.\n\nI want to go back, to a second, to that moment I lost faith in God because I thought the internet would give me a chance to appear to a crush on AIM as though I were, impossibly, cool. That’s the true story, which is why I’d like to tell a completely different one: that I had actually converted to a new faith many years before, when I stepped into the temples of Myst.\n\nA groundbreaking slideshow of a game in 1993, Myst sacrificed storytelling to create a free and open world for players to walk around in, 3D-slide-by-3D-slide. Without either a story or a direction to orient oneself, Myst offered an initial template of digital boredom as religion: the meditative point was to lose oneself in the world, particularly in its clunky ancient temples. I never quite fell in love with Myst—I’m not sure anyone did—but I do remember rushing home from Church, with its rote obligations, so I could meander around Myst’s temples without any objective in the world. I was, in a way, finding a new religion, one in which my sole aim was to scroll and scroll and scroll until, in an epiphany, I would find something of inconsequential interest.\n\nA game nearly without character or story, Myst might seem like the opposite of a religion in our earlier definition of characters-stuck-in-limited-scenarios. After all, to create a religion is, traditionally, to create a mythology of characters. And to create a mythology of characters is to deify our emotions—to freeze them as stone gods, universal archetypes shared by humanity that are abstracted from any of our own individual personality quirks.\n\nMyst attempted to create a religious experience without gods most likely due to technical limitations. But there was probably a more pragmatic reason as well, as there is to so much New Age media: gods lose their power when they break their stony silence to start moving around like the rest of us fumbling human beings. When gods look too human, as they do in virtual worlds, they become too approachable to be divinities. Early Greek sculptors mastered the art of the contrapposto to suggest that their gods could lean their weight on one knee, could move. But what if we actually saw a god move? It would likely look like a kitsch puppet show.\n\nAnd yet, this is exactly the challenge the internet artist Godmin took on with her glitch art NFT collection, Heaven Computer. Each NFT returns us to a boxy Myst-like temple of mid-90s 3D, this time with the gods in the center of the room: janky, half-formed gods that appear to move as though they were short-circuiting, their own bodies occasionally rupturing in pixels towards us at the boundary of figuration and abstraction, either due to the power of their divine incandescence or, more likely, the limitations of glitchy software. Like a Titan stuck in a Python loop, each is programmed to repeat a gesture for infinity that expresses a universal emotion in the vernacular of a flippant teenager: teasing throat-cutting threats, giddy cheerleader jumps, or a hand sassily forming an L to tell you, the would-be buyer, that you’re a total loser.\n\nJust as the broken-record visuals are too abstract to seem believable, the actions are too believable for the gods to have abstract power: they’re too rooted in a particular historical moment, too relatable, both too human and too digital, to make us think we’re seeing anything other than a blasphemous copy of a copy of a copy of a divinity. And yet, there is something touching and beautiful in their failed quest to take shape, complete an action, or convince us they’re anything but a 90s relic—like all of us, these computer gods are desperately simulating what it might be like to be human. On open calls with Godmin, rapturous devotees of the project often reiterate the connections they feel with the NFTs as echoes of lost family and friends.\n\nGodmin reminds me, in a way, of another artist: Sara Issakharian, a Persian Jewish painter based in the US who often depicts scenes from mythology, the Bible, and Donald Duck cartoons in scribbles and erasures. The subject for both artists is, in a way, the collapse of religion to a single plane where divinities from different universes all begin to intersect in a kind of trance that’s half-remembered, half-believed. In that sense, the subject is something like the internet itself: a site that flattens history and beliefs to create a self-conscious, pantheistic terrain of intersecting subcommunities, of lost and wandering gods.\n\nIt would have been tempting a few years ago to think that the internet would simply kill religion because it was a force of unbridled capitalism and irony alike, too performative and unserious to broker any kind of serious belief. But wonderful works like Heaven Computer—as well as much darker ones like incel memes—are a reminder that unserious games can be very serious belief systems. The internet, in other words, is not just a way to raze, flatten, and cross-pollinate centuries of historical religion-building. It is also, in its own way, a religion itself.\n\nTo worship at the internet’s altar of boredom and outrage—the state of all of Heaven Computer’s gods—is desperate business, of course. But what if it could also be a Myst-like meditation? What would the internet look like if we stopped seeing ourselves in its image, and we started creating it in ours?\n\nWhat if we realized not only that the internet is an inevitable religion, but the first one that humans have had say over en masse—the first time we’ve gotten not just to choose but to define our own system of belief?\n\n*** Special thanks to Tina He and Lani Trock.

Are What You Own - by David Phelps - Three quarks","link":"https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/you-are-what-you-own?s=r","content":"This is the first in a multipart series on how web3 data protocols will change the way we work—or rather, how all businesses work. This first piece was written for The Generalist’s “What to Watch in Crypto 2022,” which features a shorter version of this piece—as well as a lot of gigabrained suggestions for where the space will go by figures like Chase Chapman, Brian Flynn, Gaby Goldberg, Tina He, Li Jin, Annika Lewis (also on Ceramic!), Julia Lipton, Eshita Nandini, and… the list goes on. Check it here .\n\nIf you were a scholar in the years before the printing press, there is a decent chance that you were also a voyager—spending the bulk of your days neither reading nor lecturing, but traveling library-to-library to study and copy books. You moved, but the books did not. Their fables, dogmas, and treatises—their data—was siloed in grand, funereal libraries, and your job as a scholar was to transfer that data by hand. The printing press changed all that of course: now the books could move so you didn’t have to, and a few centuries of revolution would erupt accordingly.\n\nBut for all of technology’s advance, in today’s internet, we are mostly pre–printing-press. We can’t transfer the people we follow, the kind of media we like, the reputation and audience we’ve built—our data—from platform to platform unless, like ancient scribes, we try to do so manually. Like the scholars, we spend our time moving between platforms; the media on those platforms does not.\n\nWhat would happen if our data were transportable? This is what we often mean by the metaverse: the ability for us—as data—to transverse apps and platforms as one identity we control and own for the first time in digital history. Of course, as popular vision holds, we might dress up as our beloved NFT to attend virtual meetings and concerts so that potential friends and dates can see us as we’d like to be seen (expensive jpegs). But that’s like saying that the printing press led more people to read the Bible, rather than to, say, forge the Protestant Reformation and new conceptions of democracy.\n\nFor the real value of data portability is in at least four major social consequences:\n\ngiving us tools to track the impact of creative work as it’s shared, used, and monetized in the farthest reaches of the internet\n\nenabling us to share far more data with platforms to improve performance and recommendations\n\nincentivizing public data sets that will produce better analytics and social graphs for platforms to innovate on top of\n\nletting platforms compete for users who can port their audiences from one platform to another.\n\nIn other words, data portability represents a massive social shift in turning power from platforms to users, much as DAOs represent a transfer of power from companies to workers. Or rather, data portability represents a massive social shift in turning power from platforms to protocols, as users can only manage and transfer their data on top of universal rails that standardize, validate, and stream this data for different platforms competing over it. Platforms will have to build on top of universal data rails to draw on each other’s content and audiences, but as Joel Monegro suggested years ago , that opportunity also represents a loss. The platform moat dissipates as users port their tokens, NFTs, content, followers, and reputation across platforms—while the moat for data protocols grows huge in letting users port that data in the first place.\n\nMeta has one vision for providing the rails that would enable data portability, and it is a terrifyingly compelling one. They will own the protocol on which platforms build, they will own their own platform to bring users onto the protocol, and they will own the users’ data to monetize as they like. It is an imperial approach, accommodating the strains of subcultures into the standards of the Facebook empire, its ethical grievances synonymous with financial conquest. But there is an alternative to lay the universal data rails for data portability, and it’s a fairly simple one.\n\nLet users own their own data.\n\nThis is what Ceramic is enabling, in developing a data streaming blockchain, and its advantages compared to Meta are clear. When users own their online work, they can monetize their data, set automatic commissions whenever anyone makes use of it, and earn rewards from platforms competing to win them over. For that matter, they can also track and credential the impact of creative work: imagine writing a song and not only getting paid when others made money playing it at events, but enabling others to remix it permissionlessly with proceeds flowing back to you, all while collecting data on its usage that you could use to find professional opportunities while connecting to others with similar taste. Enabling that kind of data collection in web2 has been slightly terrifying because the data hasn’t been ours to use, to keep and share as we please; in web3, our ability to manage our data is what will enable us to manage our entire life online. NFTs are only the frontend of how we’ll be seen, in the metaverse, as data.\n\nOne reason that web3 as a term has become popularized over crypto recently is that we’re realizing financial rails are only the first step in developing distributed ledgers (DLTs) that can handle all kinds of data: social, political, ecological, and so on. If the 2010s were the decade that DLTs enabled sovereign finance, the 2020s will be the decade that offer sovereign data of all types. And we can return to our ancient scholar, wandering library to library in the vain pursuit of sharing and translating each other’s texts so that the libraries might eventually resemble one another, as a kind of meta-library featuring all texts in all languages, accessible to all. In the less poetic web3 data stack, Arweave is something like that library, hosting the books, while protocols like The Graph and Kyve serve like librarians helping to index and query the books we need.\n\nBut Ceramic is unique not only because it might be considered web3’s great competitor to Meta in developing universal rails for data—but because it’s what lets us write the books in the library in the first place. By giving us the tools to own and manage our data, it gives us incentives to collect and create new types of data that may even still be outside our imagination. And that’s the huge potential. Not simply that we can own our data online as individuals, but that we can be rewarded for sharing it, collectivizing it, and recomposing it in new communal social structures of which we haven’t fully conceived.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Carolyn Chen","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/work-pray-code?s=r","content":"Today’s book review is a bit longer than usual, but I think it’s worth it. If you read this newsletter, chances are, you’ve felt the weirdness of tech work/mission/purpose in some way — I know I have. And when I asked for reviewers in Discord, I got an overwhelming response: a “sociological analysis of tech culture as religion” seems to be something that everyone has been waiting for. Read the review, and come hang out with us at the Q\u0026A!\n\nOur guest for this Thursday, May 5 is sociologist Carolyn Chen , Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at Berkeley. Her latest book is Work Pray Code: When Work Becomes Religion in Silicon Valley .\n\nJoin us next Thursday for a Q\u0026A on tech culture, work culture, and the search for meaning within tech.\n\nThe summer I worked near the Embarcadero, two coworkers and I would huddle in the back corner conference room, holding weekly time for prayer over our catered salad lunches. Among our prayers, we would send up a benediction that our work at our mission-driven fintech startup would make a meaningful difference in the lives of our underbanked users. Each Friday afternoon, I would duck out of happy hour and dash off to catch the Richmond-bound BART from Montgomery Station so I could make it to Bible study with my friends at Berkeley. It would be close to midnight by the time I got back home to SF. This was church for me, well worth the commute for the few hours of conversation in my week that were not about tech and work.\n\nIt’s hard to find and commit to a church in the Bay Area. High rents mean the only churches that can afford to stay around for the most part are a handful of long-established institutions or well-funded, flashy megachurches. For years, a colleague-turned-friend used to livestream Sunday services from a church in Brooklyn until they found a congregation across the Bay Bridge that would accept and affirm the wholeness of their identity. Churches are already sparse to come by—try to search for temples in San Francisco, and you get the Temple Nightclub.\n\nThere is a steep activation energy to keeping up with religious life in Silicon Valley. At the same time, the intensity of work, easy reach of office amenities, and orientation toward “changing the world” redirects one’s zeal toward the ambitions of work. Silicon Valley is one of the most godless places in the world, yet is brimming with a distinctly religious fervor.\n\nThis is the paradox of religion in an increasingly secular age that sociologist Carolyn Chen confronts in Work Pray Code, beginning with the narrative of the devout parishioner who upon moving out west to work at a startup, eventually “traded his Christianity for an even more zealous faith in the eventual IPO of his start-up.”\n\nWork Pray Code’s diagnosis is straightforward: As the institutions that have undergirded religious and civic life fall into precipitous decline, work has swooped in to fill the void for alienated white-collar workers who are grasping for meaning in their lives. Taking on the role of a corporate mother, pastor, and personal coach, the workplace absorbs the motions of religious devotion, redirecting the ardor of a spiritual quest toward the aims of self-improvement and productivity.\n\nIn Chen’s first book, Getting Saved in America: Taiwanese Immigration and Religious Experience , the author followed the religious formation of Taiwanese American immigrants who adopt Christianity or Buddhism upon arriving in America, congregating in religious centers that doubled as migrant community hubs. I can’t help but see a similar socialization happen with interns and new grad transplants who arrive in the Bay Area.\n\nLike the entrepreneurs and career changers that Chen interviews after moving to Silicon Valley, these transplants find religion in their identity as techies. Nurtured by sprawling, well-endowed corporate motherships and startup offices, they come to identify with their employers, internalizing the aesthetics and values of their company and industry. Far from home, a workplace that beckons their full, authentic self becomes a family to them. Soon enough, it becomes their church as well, commanding their piety while pastoring them into being the most productive employee they can be. In Chen’s words: “People are not ‘selling their souls’ at work. Rather, work is where they find their souls.”\n\nWriting with an eye for history, Chen traces the roots of bring your whole self to work “expressive individualism” back to 18th century Romanticism and the Transcendentalist thought of Thoreau. She hints at the past of the Whole Earth Catalog-toting New Communalists and Mystics of late 1960s counterculture who later became a part of the establishment, today’s highly sought after executive coaches and gurus. She juxtaposes the rich landscape of civic participation of the 1950s, where white-collar workers fled corporate drudgery in lodges and churches, with today’s dearth of civic or religious life and an attitude toward white-collar work that has evolved into adulation. She locates the origins of the workplaces touting themselves as family in American companies seeking to compete with Japanese conglomerates in the 1980s by emulating their workplace ethos that prioritizes unrelenting, family-like loyalty to the firm. I have to wonder, though, how the rise of remote and hybrid work will change this workplace-as-family dynamic.\n\nKey to reshaping the workplace was a heightened emphasis on spirituality-tinged self-improvement and culture building. Workplaces started investing in the “whole self” of their employees, engineering a corporate “faith community” that draws highly-skilled, highly-paid workers to find their fulfillment in work. Chen follows a cadre of “mindfulness entrepreneurs” that sell services such as meditation, yoga, and coaching as not just perks, but indispensable to the performance of valuable knowledge workers. However, you have to wonder if something is lost when the means for religious formation are repurposed for the mere aim of increased productivity.\n\nThe corporate spiritual menu of vaguely Buddhist practices is stripped of authenticity and rigor, presented only in generic, palatable form in service of productivity. It glosses over a rich local history of psychedelics and spirituality , gentrifying out any trace of woo woo weirdness. Chen’s most convicting chapter, “Killing the Buddha,” argues that this whitewashing amounts to cultural appropriation and ethical abdication, leaving “a Buddhism that’s had the religion steam cleaned out of it.”\n\nThe “turn on, tune in, drop out” hippie counterculture embraced a naive, utopian escapism from societal responsibility. Similarly, Corporate Buddhism has stripped traditional Buddhism of its ethical core, precluding critical thinking about the nature of the work that tech employees are supposed to perform with greater efficiency after a meditation session.\n\nToday, the corporate tech worker downloads productivity-enhancing mindfulness exercises delivered via the politically correct, sanitized therapy speak and Corporate Memphis of apps like Headspace. She will never have to study the sutras, take the vow of refuge, or see yellow-robed monks chanting nianfo, unless as ornamentation at an extravagantly produced mindfulness conference. Such a culture, inextricably linked to the white supremacist appropriation and erasure of Asian Buddhism , neuters the radical, ethical potential of religion .\n\nChen’s fieldwork took her to the well-stocked company cafeterias and yoga rooms of corporate motherships, the auditoriums of mindfulness conferences, and the hot springs of retreat centers like Esalen. Work Pray Code focuses on tech companies, their highly-skilled, highly-pampered knowledge worker employees, and the support staff that “make them whole.” While Chen remains disciplined in the scope of her work, it’s worth noting that the religiosity of the tech industry extends far beyond the reality distortion field built by tech companies.\n\nBeyond the walls of startup offices, tech workers are microdosing LSD and freebasing toad in some nondescript living room of a Victorian in the Mission, entertaining life extension and immortality while heating up dumplings over trapstep at Burning Man, or constructing a pseudo-religion in the form of crypto degen culture , one Discord shitpost at a time. Though sharing roots in the wide-ranging trove of countercultural thought and alternative culture that made Silicon Valley weird in the first place, these expressions of spirituality, free and ungoverned, are not constrained by top-down corporate mandate. It is one thing to optimize worker performance to achieve a blowout quarter; quite another to truly blow your mind.\n\nTechtopia’s ambitions are far greater than commanding zealous employee loyalty. Tech wants to commandeer the godhead itself. The Black Mirror episode “San Junipero” asks: What if heaven were a place on earth—one that humanity must create through achieving technological Singularity? Ever since the construction of the Ark and the Tower of Babel, humanity has grasped toward divinity, leveraging technologies physical and spiritual to transcend mortality.\n\nToday, it is onsite yoga and meditation classes, expensed for little more than optimizing working potential. But the yearning for the divine will not be so constrained to earthly purpose. As we invent on, clamoring to transcend our mortal condition, we will inevitably encounter tough questions—ones that our religions, the compounded amalgamation of many millennia of human wisdom, can uniquely begin to answer.\n\nThis all being said, Work Pray Code is a sociology of labor, not a theological treatise. Chen’s focus on tech workplaces serves as a worthwhile preview of the direction white collar work is heading. After all, she warns, “Rather than ridicule Silicon Valley tech workers for worshiping work, perhaps we should wonder whether they are harbingers of things to come—whether their orientation toward work may already be ours, too.”\n\nWhat do we lose if the workplace becomes the only remaining institution where people can find meaning, are expected to make it their golden calf, and even then only if they are a certain kind of knowledge worker? If our daily bread is stripped of ethical consideration, leveraged for “self-hacking” instead of religious formation, how does that affect what kind of technology gets built? A chosen elect of tech workers are enjoying a more integrated and comfortable life than ever before—but, Work Pray Code asks, at what cost—for those workers, and for everyone else?\n\nKevin Chu is an engineer and writer. He is on Twitter and Goodreads .\n\nWhat are you reading lately?\n\nThe book I just reviewed here, d’oh!\n\nBut also, after finishing Work Pray Code, I picked up Buddhist chaplain Chenxing Han’s Be the Refuge: Raising the Voices of Asian American Buddhists , in which I found my culturally Buddhist upbringing reflected back at me. Be the Refuge continues the conversation about the erasure of Asian and Asian American Buddhists, exploring the rich complexity of Asian American Buddhism beyond the dichotomy of “two Buddhisms.”\n\nCan you tell us a little more about your personal experiences with religion and how it's shaped the way you approach the tech world?\n\nI grew up attending both church and temple, spending my summers between rehearsing “Father Abraham” at VBS and washing vegetables for the sangha’s daily communal vegetarian meal. Today, I introduce myself as Christian, but am readily inspired by bell hooks’ spiritual grounding as a Buddhist Christian.\n\nWe often talk about scale in tech. However, contemplating the vast infinitude of Creation will put all of that into perspective real quick. Even if Brian Chesky had the right idea when he wrote of operating on an “infinite time horizon,” exercising a worldview that gazes at eternity rather than the next quarter or funding round is a humbling check against the economic short-termism and hype that drives so much of tech culture.\n\nToo many people have been sold a very narrow definition of what constitutes a good life. Having an identity grounded in something higher acts as a counterweight against that.\n\nRead this awesome profile of Rosie Nguyen, Fanhouse cofounder and @jasminericegirl creator (let us know if you’re having issues with the paywall)\n\n“I helped build ByteDance's censorship machine” — a really interesting lens on moderation policy, building technical tools for moderation, and how the relationships between company leadership and governments affect moderation/censorship.\n\nAn “unprovable” conjecture about the emergence of random structure has just been proved. I don’t really know what’s going on but I’m obsessed… way too cool.\n\n(The next tweet in thread: “we are now taking testimony from ‘cumbandit69’ on his unjustified suspension”)\n\nReally toeing the line between funny and really really bleak\n\nFinally… on the topic of religion!!!!!\n\nIn principle, I don’t believe anyone should own or run Twitter. It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.\n\nFinal reminder to register for next week’s talk !!\n\nThinking about the applications we sent in to work at ummmm Asana and Samsara and Zendesk and Zenefits and …..,\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

vision of a better psychological future","link":"https://amandango.substack.com/p/a-vision-of-a-better-psychological","content":"Recently, I’ve been unable to stop thinking about the state of our collective psychology. A mass of ideas and possibilities of what the future could look like has been swirling and crystallizing in my mind. I’d like to try and paint it here.\n\nThis is the gist of it:\n\nIt seems like everyone is quietly struggling with trauma.\n\nOur experience could be a lot better.\n\nWe can do something about it.\n\nBefore I jump in, a disclaimer: I am not an expert in any of these fields, yet. The writing below is ‘broad brush strokes sketching some things Amanda observes’. I suspect it has the tone of outrage that arises from seeing a glaring injustice under one’s nose for the first time. I would love for you to see the direction of the brush strokes here, and tell me where you have more pointillistic knowledge and can help me fill in the picture.\n\nI also think it’s really important to understand the worldview out of which writing arises, so you get a sense for the writer’s biases, inclinations, and how to interpret their writing. If you feel similarly, here’s some context on the events and motivations that led to this post.\n\nOk, now we’re ready. Let’s go.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated by people’s inner worlds. What thoughts are happening in your mind as you look at me? What makes your heart beat fast? How old is the little you inside, curled up in the corner? The more I’ve looked and voyaged in people’s hearts and minds, the more a little voice has started to creep up: wait, it whispers, wait, why are we all … so … scared? Why is everyone in a sort of inner battle with themselves, clawed at by voices from their childhood and the ghosts of fear and self-hatred?\n\nWhen I say ‘everyone is quietly struggling with trauma’, I don’t mean Capital T Trauma – the kind that stems from really terrible events like abuse or sexual assault. I mean little t trauma – events that “exceed our capacity to cope and cause a disruption in emotional functioning”. It’s being told off by a teacher when you were 6, and learning to live within the lines to avoid being yelled at. It’s thinking that your parents’ love is conditional on you achieving, and learning to contort yourself to get love.\n\nEveryone is walking around with a heavy quilt of beliefs they accumulated throughout their lives that is holding them back from living in a fulfilled, resonant way. I have yet to meet anyone who has fully shrugged off this quilt (and I’ve looked, pretty hard). It’s not anyone’s fault. We just grew up imbibing our environments, societal narratives, and our parents’ trauma, and we weren’t taught how to unwind them.\n\nFor many years, the little questioning voice got drowned out. Other, louder voices piped up. You’re so privileged, they said, how dare you complain? Everything is so much better now than it was 100 years ago. Maybe it’s just you and other people are fine. At least we’re not in a war. If the worst we have to deal with is some fear of taking creative risks or a bit of anxiety, that’s a pretty good outcome.\n\nThen I read a beautiful book, The Listening Society . It had a clear message: The amount of suffering people are going through is not okay, even if it’s been worse in the past, even if we haven’t solved poverty yet. Our psychological experience could be so much better.\n\nThis message rippled through me. It was like someone gave me a hall pass to stop sleepwalking and start protesting the status quo. Everywhere I looked, little t trauma jumped out. I popped onto Zoom Memes for Quaranteens and was astounded at how many memes were about anxiety, depression, hating school, hating yourself, being miserable, please help, get me out of here. And we laugh about it, because laughter is the sweetener when the drink is too bitter to swallow. But how is it okay that 34% of the US population is affected by anxiety disorders in their lifetime? How is it okay that so many people are lonely, have abusive relationships, are addicted to alcohol, or have major insecurities that keep them trapped in suboptimal situations? How is it okay that basically every single person is out of touch with their true selves, when it doesn’t have to be this way?\n\nThe world got more complex, and our narratives and institutions haven’t kept up. We’re assaulted by stimulation 24/7. We’re facing the kind of problems that require many big actors with competing incentives to cooperate. Every few weeks I have a small 2-min freak out about how nuclear weapons are just sitting there and one time we almost destroyed the world and the only thing that stopped us was one person's bravery and sense of self-agency (before I promptly repress that fear and try to get on with my life). We have an overwhelming number of choices daily: which country and city to live in, which friends to have, what to post on Instagram, what diet to follow, and hundreds more parameters. The guidebook that religion provided has dissipated.\n\nAnd yet, no one teaches us how to cope with any of this. Schools don’t support us to become creatively fulfilled. They don’t teach us how to process climate change. We learn how to memorize the discounting formula for stocks over a period of 7 years (which, quite frankly, I forgot about 2 weeks after I sat the midterm), but not how to process overwhelming grief. So, we find everyone going through a similar journey, haunted by a malaise about the vast, daunting complexity of the world and the insufficiency of our psychological tools to keep up. But we go through the journey haphazardly – stumbling across solutions by chance – and, mostly, alone.\n\nWhen I ask you what the world will look like 100 years from now, it’s very easy to picture tall glass skyscrapers, plants on the walls of buildings, and sleek autonomous cars (à la solarpunk aesthetic ) But when I ask how it will feel, it’s much harder. Why don’t we have clear narratives of the psychological future?\n\nLet me lay out one sketch of what this could look like.\n\nEvery child learns the occupation of living . We learn how to process emotions (\"What are you feeling? Ah, sadness? How wonderful that you were able to name that. Let's just sit here a while, I'll hold you, just feel it through. It's okay.\"). We have healthy relationships with anger, sadness, hurt, and fear. We learn that our reality is many narratives layered on top of each other (\"You think you’ll never be good at math because you learn more slowly than others? Do you see how that's an interpretation you have? What if you were taught differently?\") and how much agency we truly have (\"What do you want to create? What's standing in your way? Let's turn it into a plan\"). We feel loved, safe, and stable. Because we have so much security in ourselves, we have no need to push others down. We’re taught to try to understand where other people are coming from (\"What do you imagine he's feeling right now?\"). When we’re in difficult situations, rather than reacting quickly and lashing out, we process and try to empathize. We have stable, healthy relationships with each other that bring us joy. We don’t need to fill a hole of loneliness with social media. We don’t need to clutch identities to protect our ego. We’re resilient, loving, fulfilled.\n\nIsn’t this, fundamentally, what we’re trying to achieve with all our material progress? Everyone needs a base level of material stability, but that alone doesn’t get us there – countries like New Zealand, paradises in many ways, still have some of the highest youth suicide rates in the world.\n\nI think a lot of what therapy does is remind people of their own intrinsic resources. People get stuck thinking that this is just the way it is (I'll always be scared of failure, I'll always interact with my partner this way). And therapy reminds us that: actually, these are false constraints. There are so many ways out and we don’t have to stay trapped in any situation. And I want us to do the same for our psychological visions of the future: instead of thinking that this is all there is, we can realize that it doesn't have to be this way – it could be *so much better*.\n\nThis is perhaps the most exciting part. Imagine how the entire dynamics of human societies would change in a world filled with healed people. Psychological healing is upstream of so many good things, like having functional political systems, good company cultures, healthy relationships, people caring about climate change – the list goes on.\n\nWhy? Many of the issues in these systems (political polarization, putting others down in the workplace, clinging on to toxic relationships, harming the environment out of numbness) come from our own hurt, insecurities, and lack of self-love. When you unwind all of these layers, at the bottom of it all, we end up just loving other people. We have so much more emotional capacity to notice and internalize what others are experiencing.\n\nThis higher level of empathy pushes the world closer to an equilibrium of cooperation. It changes the game theoretical calculus: less concern for self and more concern for others means you get more of a payoff by cooperating with others. It even changes the framing of the games: when you understand others’ incentives and desires, it is much easier to convert zero sum situations (either you win or I win) into positive sum (here’s a scenario where we both win). I have a sneaking suspicion that many more situations could be positive sum than we currently think. Imagine what the world would look like if in every choice, everyone pressed the cooperate button.\n\nThe world is inevitably going to face disasters on many scales. I am excited about viewing psychological healing in the context of creating a resilient, antifragile system.\n\nOn an individual level, the more we heal, the more resilient we become. Healthy emotional processing lets you work through sadness, anger or frustration and have a measured, kind response. The more psychologically resilient our systems become (the less we jump to protests and violence and individualism whenever there’s a problem), the more we’ll be able to cope with the complex challenges we will inevitably have to face.\n\nAn amorphous thought that keeps going around my head: Someone has their thumb on the nuclear button (or the AGI-button, or renewable-energy-instead-of-coal button). Would you rather that person have a power complex because their father neglected them or insecurities about being good enough, or that they be psychologically healed and well-adjusted? Would you rather systems optimize for avoiding blame because people are scared of failure and judgment, or that they optimize for bravery and good decision making?\n\nWhat next? This post is an incomplete, first pass at articulating this swirling cloud of ideas. There are many people already doing incredible work in this space – the meditation community, neurotech and psychedelic communities, therapists, coaches and psychiatrists, and a smattering of flourishing and happiness labs . I don’t yet have a clear sense of which interventions are most promising. But, a couple that I feel excited about:\n\nMomentum building and narrative shifting. Let’s shift from a narrative of “psychological healing is a nice-to-have that everyone is haphazardly figuring out themselves” to one of “systematically healing everyone’s trauma and helping people have healthy coping strategies is an urgently important way to achieve our individual goals, to create a resilient society, and help people be much happier and more fulfilled”. Let’s paint the picture of a positive 100-year vision of what it could feel like to be alive. Let’s get everyone talking about effective strategies for psychological healing as much as they talk about climate change. Let’s build the kind of momentum that gets more funding, entrepreneurs, and researchers into this space.\n\nTeaching emotional processing. What would the school for the occupation of living look like? What do we systematically teach 5 year olds to help them become psychologically wise? How do we package up the wisdom of therapists \u0026 psychologists, and help everyone understand the mechanisms behind healthy psychologies?\n\nI’m really excited to find and talk to people interested in this space. There is so much more for me to learn. I want to understand the mechanisms – what exactly is happening in the brain with trauma? What are the commonalities underlying the different therapies? I want to get a clear sense of what kind of interventions this space needs. Is it movement building, a psychological wisdom fund, an incubator, research, or just focusing on a concrete startup / organization and running with that?\n\nIf any of this resonated with you, let’s chat. I would absolutely love to hear: What made sense to you? What didn’t? What interventions do you know of? What do you think are the impactful levers we can pull? If you’re excited about working on this, then let’s definitely chat :) My email is amanda.mai.ngo at gmail.com, and my Twitter is @manda_ngo.\n\nThank you to Anna Wang, Carmen Lau, Chris Painter, Ethan Perez, Jason Benn, Mackenzie Dion, Richard Ngo, Sasha Chapin, and Vishal Maini for incredibly helpful feedback and cheerleading.\n\nThanks to Angus Blair, Chris Hagan, Mike McCormick, and Quintin Frerichs for great conversations that helped shape these ideas.\n\nAll errors in this post are my own!\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Wikipedia Explorer and found a dimension I had never seen before - the great composers of history and the contentious relationship with their works up to and including death.\n\nFinzi and his ten year death sentence reflected in the agonized first movement of his Cello Concerto, played on the radio for the first time the night before his death.\n\nHaydn , unable to compose due to illness, finding solace by sitting at the piano and playing Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser .\n\nJoplin , whose neurosyphilis would eventually kill him and which likely impacted his ability to play, still having bursts of lucidity in a mental institution where he would jot down lines of music hurriedly before relapsing.\n\nAll of these found thanks to trying to find a common thread between four blocks of text represented by numbers - 7081, 17952, 358944, 740201 - and then chasing the resulting ball of yarn as it rolls around a thousand dimensional space.\n\nThrough the lens of this language model I can search for the emotional residue of great works distilled into phrases I would never have been able to explicitly search for. It's not the language model that's bringing us this knowledge, it's simply connecting threads of an intricate web that we've assembled both implicitly and explicitly over thousands of years, billions of observations, and a multitude of encoded emotions.\n\nLanguage is humanity's longest running program, capturing, producing, mirroring, and explaining our thoughts, fears, hopes and warnings. Every phrase and every utterance, as long as it's echoed forward in time, helps build out that web. This has always been true throughout history but applies now more than ever.\n\nHalf a century ago the indexes in books were manually written. A quarter of a century ago search engines began to automate this index. Today language models burn through sequences of abstract symbols and, thanks to all the links and anchors left by humans across such a haphazard sequence, are starting to assemble an index along dimensions we'd never have been able to elucidate or comprehend before.\n\nThat's the era we're entering - and we should ensure it's an era of hope. We should design these tools such that the fear of being replaced by them is as nonsensical as the fear of being outrun by an automobile. It's a matter of maintaining irrational optimism in the face of uncertainty. This mechanized world of linguistic automation isn't threatening a loss of language or individuality or purpose, it's offering a potential flourishing of it. Humanity's passion projects run deep. Deep enough for billions of humans. Deep enough for billions of teraflops.

M. Sacasas","link":"https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/a-theory-of-zoom-fatigue?s=r","content":"Why is video-conferencing so exhausting?\n\nThe question is worth asking because it is helpful to understand what’s involved in an activity many of us cannot now avoid. It’s also worth asking because it helps us understand how human communication works under ordinary circumstances.\n\nHere’s how I came across the question this morning:\n\nThere are a number factors at play here, but many of them do tend to coalesce around one important consideration: the body matters to the work of communicating and sense-making.\n\nI’ll get back to that in just a moment, but first some other factors, briefly noted.\n\nCommunication is always hard work, and the fact that we are pretty good at it in certain contexts makes it easy to forget this. But think for a moment about the wonder of it all. You have things going on inside of you, sometimes very complex things, and you manage to get some sense of those things across to someone who is not you through the use of sounds, gestures, facial expressions, inscriptions, images, etc. From a certain perspective, it’s a small miracle whenever it happens.\n\nThe media we use to communicate with one another always make it easier to do so in some respects and harder in others. This may seem like a banal observation, but, again, I think we tend to forget this. It is especially useful to consider what a medium makes possible by way of expression, what it makes impossible, what it encourages, what it discourages, etc. I would suggest, too, that there is an art to using each medium well, not just those we think of as “artistic.”\n\nWith regards to video conferencing specifically, it’s much too tempting to multi-task while we do so. And, as we should all know by now, nobody multi-tasks well. It’s especially exhausting to be continuously dropping a conversational thread and picking it up again. Something as seemingly benign as a notification flashing on the screen, even if we don’t attend to it for more than a split second, can throw us off the thread of thought, and the momentary work of trying to pick it up again takes a mental toll.\n\nWe should bear in mind, too, the physical strain of video-conferencing, which we might associate with things like poor posture required by less than ideal set-ups, having to remain relatively still in front of a camera, staring at a screen for long periods of time, etc. All of this can be enough to make the experience challenging.\n\nWhen video conferencing, it’s not just that we are tempted to check email or social media while simultaneously attending to meeting participants. It is also the case that we are paying attention to ourselves in an odd way. Thanks to my image on the screen, I’m conscious of myself not only from within but also from without. We are always to some degree internally conscious of ourselves, of course, but this is the usual “I” in the “I-Thou” relation. Here we are talking about something like an “I-Me-Thou” relation. It would be akin to having a mirror of ourselves that only we could see present whenever we talked with others in person. This, too, amounts to a persistent expenditure of social and cognitive labor as I inadvertently mind my image as well as the images of the other participants.\n\nNow on to the main point, which is not altogether unrelated to some of the foregoing considerations. The body matters in communication, but perceiving an image of a body in virtual space rather than perceiving a body itself in shared space may be worse than not perceiving a body at all.\n\nIn the past, I have found the work of the philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty helpful in thinking about how a smartphone mediates conversations, so I’ll do the same here to think about video-conferencing.\n\nIt starts with a particular theory of perception. Hubert Dreyfus helpfully explained an important element of how Merleau-Ponty thought about what was going on when we perceive the world:\n\n“It is crucial that the agent does not merely receive input passively and then process it. Rather, the agent is already set to respond to the solicitations of things. The agent sees things from some perspective and sees them as affording certain actions. What the affordances are depends on past experience with that sort of thing in that sort of situation.”\n\nIn other words, when we perceive the world our senses are not just objectively reporting facts about the world to our minds. Rather, our mind is already at work interpreting and construing the world according to its store of past experience. It’s always a matter of seeing-as, not simply seeing. We might say that we are perceiving in part what we expect to perceive and also that our perception is shaped by what we’re about at that given moment.\n\nConsider how Charles Taylor explains this dynamic:\n\n“As I navigate my way along the path up the hill, my mind totally absorbed anticipating the difficult conversation I’m going to have at my destination, I treat the different features of the terrain as obstacles, supports, openings, invitations to tread more warily or run freely, and so on. Even when I’m not thinking of them, these things have those relevances for me; I know my way about among them.”\n\nAnd in order to make our way in the world in this way, our bodies seek a position from which to achieve an “optimal grip” on our environment. Consider, for example, how we position ourselves before a painting in a gallery in order to take it in. Ordinarily, there’s no sign that says “Stand Here,” but we naturally find the place anyway without giving it much conscious thought.\n\nLikewise, in face-to-face conversation we are constantly seeking out the elements of meaning afforded by the body of our interlocutors, we are seeking an optimal grip on the communicative process. While our conscious attention is focused on words and their meaning, our fuller perceptive capabilities are engaged in reading the whole environment. In conversation, then, each person becomes a part of a field of communication that includes, but is not limited to verbal expression.\n\nThe problem with video-conferencing is that the body is but isn’t there. This means that our minds are at least partly frustrated as they deploy their non-conscious repertoire of perceptive skills. The situation is more like a face-to-face encounter than most any other medium, but, for that very reason, it frustrates us because it is, nonetheless, significantly different. I suppose we might think of it as something like a conversational uncanny valley. The full range of what the mind assumes should be available to it when it perceives a body, simply isn’t there.\n\nThe body is there as a two dimensional image before us, interacting with us in something approaching simultaneity. But because we are not actually sharing the same physical space, we can’t quite achieve the optimal grip we’re accustomed to achieving in conversation.\n\nFor one thing, unless someone is making a determined effort, eye contact is never quite right. And if someone is making a determined effort to look into the camera, then that means they are not seeing your eyes. It’s a no-win situation.\n\nOther factors make the video-conferencing exchange slippery to a mind seeking optimal grip:\n\nEven with a very good connection, there can be an almost imperceptible lag time that adds another layer of slipperiness resisting our mind’s efforts to achieve an optimal grip. This is to say nothing of the sometimes frequent and obvious lags created by unstable internet connections.\n\nFaces are present to us, but typically at a less than ideal distance, making it difficult to perceive the subtle cues we rely on to gauge whether someone is following along, interested, confused, disengaged, etc. The more participants, the smaller the screen, the harder to pick up such cues.\n\nParticipants are not, in fact, sharing the same physical space, making it difficult to perceive our conversation partners as part of a cohesive perceptive field. They lose their integrity as objects of perception, which is to say they don’t appear whole and independent; they appear truncated and as parts of a representation within another object of perception, the screen.\n\nWhat all of this amounts to, then, is a physically, cognitively, and emotionally taxing experience for many users as our minds undertake the work of making sense of things under such circumstances. We might think of it as a case of ordinarily unconscious processes operating at max capacity to help us make sense of what we’re experiencing.\n\nWhich is not to say that one should avoid video-conferencing altogether or that it does not have certain virtues. Right now, most everything is operating in a less than ideal manner, and we’re fumbling our way toward some version of “good enough.” But in order to use these tools well, it’s worth reckoning with what Zoom or Skype can and cannot do. We should understand how they might be undermining our stated objectives, and we should be clear about what we are asking of others when we mandate their use.\n\nWelcome to new readers, glad you made your way here.

Atlas Futura -- A Guild for Cosmotechnicists — Wendi Yan","link":"https://mirror.xyz/qualiatinker.eth/6c4VLPaS3hqpuWT2iz4yEXRRMHFtMa4vilZvT5lKdmI","content":"Proposing Atlas Futura — A Guild for Cosmotechnicists\n\nTo spark a grounded techno-optimism, we believe in the value and necessity of creating a pluralistic store of possible futures. With Atlas Futura, we propose a guild for cosmotechnicists that treat expanding the collective imaginary as a public good. The guild would bring together artists, philosophers, technologists and scientists to collectively speculate what futures could be, and release “world drops” to share the visions as artwork. In this proposal, we provide an execution pipeline and a series of potential “world drops” for Atlas Futura -- a map collection of futures.\n\nThis proposal was our submission to the Gitcoin Public Goods RFP in the summer of 2021. Although the three of us did not eventually work on a project exactly like what we proposed, we have continued to explore similar directions in our own ways. Jasmine worked on A Declaration of the Interdependence of Cyberspace , and is a core steward of the collective, Verses , that emerged from the core group that created the Declaration. Lila has been furthering her studies in media, psychology and speculative fiction in college. Wendi made speculative art for ecodao ’s initial NFT release and is pursuing more worldbuilding projects.\n\nWe believe that this proposal still holds value as a witness of our intellectual and creative growth. We’re self-publishing the piece for anyone who might be interested in exploring a similar model of collective imagination. If you want to reach out, please contact us via Twitter: Jasmine , Lila , Wendi .\n\nWendi Yan . New media artist, documentary filmmaker, History of Science student at Princeton. Her research and creative practices revolve around the construction of reality, entangled selfhood and post-anthropocene technologies.\n\nLila Shroff. Cognitive science and creative writing student at Stanford. Fascinated by the power of narratives to shape human behavior and the future of digital worlds.\n\nJasmine Wang . Maker and poet, part of Verses , Editor-in-Chief at Kernel Magazine . She is interested in the phenomenology of agency, the preservation of the sacred, and simulating what past and future philosophers might say about the way we live, act, and are today.\n\nThank you to the friends who helped us in our iteration process:\n\nWe live in a time of increasing nihilism, weakening social fabric, and flagging optimism in our institutions. Those most involved in architecting the future largely come from backgrounds in technology, whilst those imagining the future often don’t feel empowered to execute on those visions. We believe that creating an interdisciplinary collective able to both dream and execute could spark a grounded techno-optimism, and that our work is a public good in several ways:\n\nWe believe that lengthening the collective imagination is a prerequisite for increasing the Buxton Index : the length of the period, measured in years, over which the entity makes its plans. The Buxton Index is important for societal decision-making aligned for the long-term. ‘Zooming out’ in this way also helps contextualize one’s own work and allay individual ennui: Baumeister finds in Meanings of Life that a short motivational narrative for an action is associated with feeling dissonance with the ends of that action. For example, a thief who believes herself to be ethical will not think about the futures entailed after she picks the lock; she focuses only on the task of picking said lock;\n\nWe also believe that it is powerful to concretize futures. By doing so, we shorten the psychological ‘distance’ to them, interfering with our natural bias to discount the future in favour of the present. Trope and Liberman found in 2010 that the fidelity of the mental construction of an object affected prediction, preference, and action;\n\nAnd, finally, we believe that increasing the pluralistic store of possible futures is a public good. It has been often proposed that crypto lays the groundwork for the metaverse. In Anarchy, State, and Utopia, Robert Nozick defines a utopia as a world that every inhabitant believes to be the best possible world (e.g. there is no world they would rather be in). Since there is probably no single world that meets this criteria, it follows that a true utopia is actually a meta-utopia, or one in which many worlds are possible. If we accept this definition of utopia, the question becomes how we end up in a world where the largest possible set of worlds are available. Nozick’s answer was right-libertarianism, but digital worlds where people can mint surplus out of thin air potentially do not need to be bound by market logic. The imagining of worlds that do not need to immediately capture and sustain their own maintenance and creation economically is crucial. One is unable to choose one world over another if one does not have the language in order to do so; for example, think of how horrified we (the Western technologically savvy elite) are to learn of North Koreans not having access to internet, or the legal case where Amish parents were allowed to keep their children from finishing junior high because they were worried about how exposure to a different world would change their value systems. We understand intuitively that awareness of possible, achievable worlds is good. The set of possible worlds available to the collective imagination is a public good: they are non-excludable and infinitely viewable. In fact, the more people participate in and encounter the worlds that we create, the more useful they become: it becomes more possible to discuss and build towards alternative worlds.\n\nOn the unique human ability to imagine the future, Karl Popper wrote \"let our conjectures, our theories, die in our stead!\" In other words: let us imagine our failures so we do not live them.\n\nFor much of human history, our conception of the future was not all that varied from the present. It wasn't until the publication of Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward that the genre of time travel—one that permeates so much media today—really came to be. But now, as the pace of scientific progress accelerates, the rate of sociological progress does not keep up, there is a need for the type of sociological imagination and ideation we hope to encourage with Atlas Futura.\n\nAtlas Futura is a speculative creative collective of artists, philosophers, technologists, and scientists united by a desire to expand the collective imaginary of our shared futures.\n\nThe goals of the collective are to:\n\nNote: WORLD DROPS are not intended to be positive or negative renderings of our imagined futures. Rather, they are meant to serve as neutral playgrounds for ideation.\n\nFungi has become an intimate component of our technological system, in a spacetime with radically personalized and autonomous data tracking. A paradigm shift in science has given rise to a new generation of organic technologies enabled by breakthroughs in biological research. Intimate technologies are embedded in our daily reality: one such set of technology is fungal facewear paired with graphene tattoos for decentralized biometric data collection.\n\nThis WORLD DROP provides a series of fungal facewear that can be worn by individuals through AR lenses. The 3D model of each facewear is an NFT.\n\nML algorithms have learned to make up humans, but their humans never wear the same jewelry on both ears. Occasionally, weird shapes and materials emerge on their humans’ faces. These jewelries, born out of the ML “glitches,” become the identifiers between “real” and “fake” humans.\n\nThis WORLD DROP provides pairs of jewelries in AR filters, and sells pairs corresponding to each ML-generated human as NFTs.\n\nLet’s say commercial space flights are available to the public, and a residency calls for creators of all kinds to live on the Moon. What projects could they make?\n\nThe WORLD DROP website will be designed as a residency project catalogue, with images “collected” from the “artists” for their “projects.” Atlas Futura will make the renderings and/or digital 3D assets for these speculative creative works, which will be minted as NFTs.\n\nYou are a brain wandering in the liminal space between two life cycles. You stumble upon a shop displaying all sorts of cognitive enhancement products. From eye drops that give you more color sensitivity, to gummies for better sonic hedgehog growth factors, you get to pick a few things for your next life. What would you take?\n\nWe have already developed a 3D game for this world, where the brain (the player) gets a random amount of money each time playing the game. (View full product list here ) With more time and funding, we want to develop an upgraded list of speculative neuro products with neuro engineers, meditators and philosophers, and release these speculative products as a collection of NFTs on speculating a future of paradise engineering .\n\nAfter a young martyr nearly succeeded in liberating all the universe's information, the State cracked down and began holding all information hostage in state-run cold storage Information Jail. Now, instead of taxes, State budgets are funded by the sale of locked information back to the public domain.\n\nImmediately after the Great Information Jaling, fearing the death of Reason, the living populace was quick to reclaim the sciences and most of history before Truth vanished from memory. Unfortunately, the generations alive during the Great Information Jailing have all passed away and no one knows what's been left locked up—except you.\n\nYou were hired to work as a guard person at Information Jail #1618 and on your first shift, you were doing your nightly count to make sure no bits had escaped, when you realized all the cell names were completely unfamiliar to you.\n\nWhat do they mean? You have to know.\n\nYou ask the State if you can buy these so-called “ARTS” back into the public domain. You are shocked to learn that the information contained in these words is more expensive than you could ever imagine—much much more than the price of Biology or Chemistry or even Physics. Since you’ll never be able to afford them, you take it upon yourself to start releasing them—in pieces so infinitesimally small you won’t possibly be noticed.\n\nStarting with poetry, each week you release 100 verses of original poetry verses (generated from a model trained on relevant texts, each verse to be released as an NFT), and people (who find verses hidden in this WORLD DROP’s playground) begin mashing verses together to create public works of poetry which are displayed on a WORLD DROP gallery website (and later, as projections in an IRL room that starts blank and is filled with poetry over time).\n\nWe envision our timeline as follows...\n\nContinue with drops, grow core collective, and build community of active audience members and contributors.\n\nDrops #5 to n - To infinite futures and beyond!\n\nWhat we have outlined above is a list of projects our core team has already started working on that can be modified into the initial WORLD DROPS. As we gather momentum in the upcoming months, we will expand our collaborative practice by working with a more diverse group of thinkers and creators, and making WORLD DROPS more complex in worldbuilding and interactivity design.\n\nImagine a restaurant for people on an algae-full diet. Humans have transitioned to the phytonutrient-rich food source that’s resilient in all weathers, and come up with creative ways to make algae food tasteful. We will work with biologists and gastronomists to provide a menu for the algae cuisine.\n\nImagine a world where every individual has their basic needs met and work is largely automated. Is this a world of leisure or is it one where individuals pursue their unique creative and intellectual ambitions in their entirety? Through an intelligently designed game simulation we call upon the public to explore outcomes.\n\nImagine an artificial organism whose actions are determined by NFT transactions on the site, and over a limited period of time, everyone can watch the organism mutate and evolve.\n\nImagine a dial where the rate of technological development can be adjusted by the population. Certain rates of development are more favorable for society than others, but determining the proper pace is difficult. 1000 NFTs at a fixed cost are created, each token representing 1/1000 of remaining future technological progress. The rate at which they are minted is the rate of this society’s technological development and website dashboard shows various indicators of societal and planetary health, as affected by this rate technological progress. It is the goal of the population to maximize wellbeing without irreversibly damaging planetary bounds.","tokenFrequency":{"timelin":1,"phytonutrientrich":1,"uniqu":2,"two":1,"past":1,"best":1,"togeth":2,"question":1,"ambit":1,"legal":1,"name":1,"pair":3,"upon":3,"popper":1,"interdepend":1,"definit":1,"shift":2,"metautopia":1,"maker":1,"initi":2,"ennui":1,"work":11,"surplus":1,"shorten":1,"sonic":1,"defin":1,"ear":1,"like":1,"crack":1,"take":2,"complet":1,"fix":1,"discuss":1,"play":1,"crypto":1,"discount":1,"collabor":1,"hope":1,"dashboard":1,"contact":1,"around":1,"nft":4,"univers":1,"irl":1,"liberman":1,"logic":1,"tax":1,"creation":1,"fill":1,"inhabit":1,"moon":1,"leisur":1,"rfp":1,"might":2,"time":6,"magazin":1,"achiev":1,"construct":2,"permeat":1,"make":7,"let":3,"travel—on":1,"given":1,"ml":2,"documentari":1,"captur":1,"lengthen":1,"bit":1,"econom":1,"“collected”":1,"divers":1,"interf":1,"thief":1,"momentum":1,"wasn":1,"hidden":1,"“arts”":1,"sinc":2,"lay":1,"direct":1,"menu":1,"intim":2,"gather":1,"member":1,"could":4,"action":4,"buy":1,"model":3,"potenti":2,"train":1,"help":2,"food":2,"practic":2,"nonexclud":1,"look":1,"posit":1,"stead":1,"away":1,"kind":1,"finish":1,"everyon":1,"research":2,"task":1,"show":1,"further":1,"rightlibertarian":1,"expens":1,"autom":1,"identifi":1,"limit":1,"contextu":1,"intuit":1,"wear":1,"certain":1,"other":1,"transit":1,"want":2,"physic":1,"them—in":1,"mutat":1,"shock":1,"similar":2,"hire":1,"allow":1,"autonom":1,"understand":1,"psycholog":2,"favor":1,"health":1,"exampl":2,"mani":1,"unfortun":1,"display":2,"storag":1,"map":1,"gummi":1,"instead":1,"drops”":2,"interdisciplinari":1,"“glitches”":1,"imag":1,"evolv":1,"import":1,"year":1,"align":1,"“world":2,"sever":1,"difficult":1,"token":1,"engin":2,"media":3,"beyond":1,"price":1,"wrote":1,"vanish":1,"system":2,"largest":1,"poetri":4,"utopia":4,"prerequisit":1,"inform":8,"societ":2,"involv":1,"backward":1,"unfamiliar":1,"institut":1,"we'r":1,"trope":1,"intellig":1,"anoth":1,"group":2,"tattoo":1,"case":1,"radic":1,"catalogu":1,"imagin":13,"shroff":1,"specul":8,"made":1,"human":9,"concept":1,"philosoph":4,"anyon":1,"treat":1,"maxim":1,"entail":1,"plan":1,"children":1,"game":3,"note":1,"left":1,"vision":2,"infinitesim":1,"increas":3,"paradigm":1,"guild":3,"came":1,"continu":2,"set":3,"sell":1,"thank":1,"memori":1,"next":1,"north":1,"length":1,"much":3,"enhanc":1,"write":1,"upcom":1,"complex":1,"true":1,"never":2,"concret":1,"near":1,"count":1,"viewabl":1,"'s":3,"emerg":2,"exposur":1,"present":2,"staterun":1,"flag":1,"pick":3,"artist":3,"weather":1,"full":1,"determin":2,"succeed":1,"part":1,"first":1,"socal":1,"hostag":1,"origin":1,"":52,"limin":1,"medit":1,"out":1,"aliv":1,"artwork":1,"releas":6,"stumbl":1,"brain":2,"declar":2,"agenc":1,"today":1,"pipelin":1,"month":1,"still":1,"summer":1,"filter":1,"scientist":2,"project":6,"neutral":1,"toward":1,"would":4,"found":1,"begin":1,"sociolog":2,"hedgehog":1,"biometr":1,"us":4,"damag":1,"algorithm":1,"cost":1,"outcom":1,"whilst":1,"various":1,"mental":1,"meant":1,"serv":1,"narrat":2,"pursu":2,"three":1,"ethic":1,"popul":2,"ground":2,"better":1,"thinker":1,"upgrad":1,"ecodao":1,"materi":1,"wander":1,"goal":2,"cell":1,"core":4,"although":1,"sacr":1,"say":2,"korean":1,"rise":1,"ever":1,"seri":2,"born":1,"good":6,"valu":3,"growth":2,"creativ":7,"editorinchief":1,"text":1,"share":2,"3d":3,"disson":1,"desir":1,"ideat":2,"motiv":1,"met":1,"savvi":1,"interact":1,"entiti":1,"progress":4,"restaur":1,"face":1,"twitter":1,"back":2,"abil":1,"unit":1,"often":2,"postanthropocen":1,"stanford":1,"11000":1,"measur":1,"longterm":1,"iter":1,"won't":1,"mash":1,"die":1,"friend":1,"order":1,"call":2,"eventu":1,"probabl":1,"graphen":1,"budget":1,"team":1,"resili":1,"dream":1,"acceler":1,"everi":2,"space":2,"preserv":1,"neuro":2,"commerci":1,"pace":2,"gastronomist":1,"design":3,"worri":1,"began":1,"meet":1,"occasion":1,"escap":1,"live":5,"peopl":4,"creator":2,"market":1,"activ":1,"fund":2,"avail":3,"color":1,"imaginari":2,"filmmak":1,"blank":1,"nfts":4,"particip":1,"infinit":2,"generat":3,"develop":5,"think":2,"transact":1,"anarchi":1,"vari":1,"individu":4,"prefer":1,"that":1,"intend":1,"histori":3,"basic":1,"quick":1,"word":2,"creat":6,"bring":1,"architect":1,"worn":1,"unabl":1,"natur":1,"worldbuild":2,"martyr":1,"daili":1,"galleri":1,"awar":1,"death":1,"domain":2,"sustain":1,"cyberspac":1,"digit":3,"imagine—much":1,"optim":1,"submiss":1,"“projects”":1,"cuisin":1,"encount":1,"becom":5,"groundwork":1,"associ":1,"expand":3,"fascin":1,"you'll":1,"eye":1,"pluralist":2,"princeton":1,"truth":1,"favour":1,"actual":1,"wellb":1,"today—r":1,"edward":1,"entangl":1,"wang":1,"planetari":2,"even":1,"studi":1,"lila":3,"world":27,"atlas":6,"accept":1,"without":1,"site":1,"flight":1,"reach":1,"phenomenolog":1,"pleas":1,"sensit":1,"singl":1,"lock":4,"fear":1,"necess":1,"societi":2,"rather":2,"propos":7,"websit":3,"get":2,"up—except":1,"affect":2,"organ":3,"background":1,"reclaim":1,"collect":14,"modifi":1,"execut":3,"index":2,"chang":1,"mlgener":1,"artifici":1,"power":2,"contributor":1,"scientif":1,"envis":1,"jasmin":3

published Alli's article, \"Fem3.\" The piece outlined the importance of including women and nonbinary (NB) individuals in building the foundations of Web3. \"Fem3'' argued that we all can, and should, commit to onboarding and retaining more diverse talent and voices into this space. That commitment includes uplifting successful women and NB-led projects, work, and perspectives. This series, \"Fem3 Voices,\" aims to do just that.\n\nThis interview series highlights the voices of powerful women and NB players in the web3 ecosystem. Each interview will be recorded on Twitter Spaces and accompanied by a subsequent article on Alli and Regan's mirror pages.\n\nThis week we spoke with Gaby Goldberg. Gaby is a writer and an investor at TCG crypto. She is also a Twitter influencer and perhaps most well known in the space for her web3 reading list– an excellent curation of information for newbies to crypto.\n\nGaby's infatuation with digital life and the Internet began at a young age. While she grew up with the Internet, like all of her Gen-Z peers, she developed an early relationship and presence in online communities because she was selectively mute until the age of 5. As a result, Gaby found refuge online in games like Minecraft, Runescape, and their respective communities. By the time she was a teenager, she had built connections and brands through her viral Tumblr blog. When COVID-19 lockdowns began in spring of 2020, and many of us struggled to sustain our social relationships and interactions from \"real life\" in a more digitized world, Gaby was transported to her interconnected life of the past: \"in a lot of ways, I had had this experience of truly living a, like, digital life before COVID. And so in large part I was able to sort of thrive during COVID because I was so used to spending my time online.\"\n\nLike many others, Gaby lost her job in the pandemic. Luckily, she quickly found her footing with Chapter One . In her time there, Gaby was introduced to the concept of the \" creator economy ,\" but quickly perceived that the existing tools and projects surrounding said economy were only \"bringing us halfway there,\" so she began to dig in and research a bit deeper.\n\nThere were two pivotal moments for Gaby that transitioned her fully into the world of Web3. In her early research on the creator economy, Gaby learned that Apple takes 30% of the revenue from creators who place their apps on the Apple Store. This astounded her: “maybe for a big business 30% is just a line on the balance sheet but for creators and for all of these companies who preach about people being their own business online 30% is a lot of money.”\n\nHer second “aha” moment occurred when Facebook and its host of apps, including Whatsapp and Instagram, went down for a few hours last year. She realized, “like holy shit, these companies go down tomorrow and if they take away our platform tomorrow – especially for creators and influencers who make a living online – they would have nothing.”\n\nThese moments struck something in Gaby. She wondered what it would mean for creators to own their data: \"what would it mean to have ownership in these platforms that we already build and operate every day?\" Motivated by this question, Gaby jumped headfirst into Web3 and found a home at TCG , where she currently works as an investor focused on the intersection of consumer and crypto.\n\nBefore her journey in Web3, Gaby, like many other people, initially struggled to find her purpose. She comes from a family of doctors and saw how fulfilled her family members were in their work during the pandemic– she quickly realized she didn't have that same fulfillment in what she was doing. When she started engaging with the Web3 ecosystem, Gaby began to derive joy and purpose through exploring the core values of the Internet: decentralization, community ownership, and other dynamic aspects of the Internet.\n\nVenture capital empowered Gaby to connect to those core values while helping people tell their stories and build toward their purpose. As a writer, Gaby enjoys developing and sharing narratives. As an investor, she recognizes capital is one of the most efficient ways to help someone tell their story: \"I feel really lucky to be in this position where you have like all of these resources behind you, this gas in the tank, like equity to support the narratives you care about.\"\n\nWhen she first started in venture, Gaby quickly noticed that she was often the only woman on her daily Zoom calls. In the beginning, she thought about her gender often, and at times she saw her gender identity as a factor making it difficult for her to find a voice. Ultimately, she decided to champion her voice through long-form writing and storytelling that she could share with others. She was, and is, dedicated to using her voice and work in the ecosystem to ensure that \"no other young woman entering this space is again like the only girl in the Zoom call.\"\n\nWhen asked her advice for other young women or non-binary individuals entering the Web3 space, she stressed the importance of finding and using your voice. She said she sees her writing as “the highest ROI thing” she has ever done for her career, particularly in web3, where she perceives things like her gender and lack of college degree as being “less visible.” There is inherent power, she believes, in sharing your thoughts and voice with the web3 ecosystem: “the only thing [you can] be judged for is what [you have] to say.”\n\nIn addition to working toward using her voice to encourage and elevate other women in the ecosystem, Gaby additionally hopes to support women in her work as an investor. One of Gaby’s role models in investing is Talia Goldberg (not her sister, despite the frequent confusion given the same last name). Part of Talia’s portfolio investment strategy includes a commitment to 50% of her portfolio consisting of women-founded or women-led companies. As a woman, established voice, and investor in Web3, Gaby is dedicated to doing the same– we could not be more excited to watch and support her in that journey.\n\nIf you’d like to listen to the twitter recording of Gaby’s interview, you can find that here.\n\nAlli is the Director of Education of Events at Variant Fund , a first-check crypto fund investing in the ownership economy.\n\nRegan is a senior at USC and working part time with Opyn as Associate of Education and Community.","tokenFrequency":{"women":6,"home":1,"hour":1,"argu":1,"social":1,"presenc":1,"elev":1,"game":1,"result":1,"invest":3,"despit":1,"abl":1,"twitter":3,"see":1,"equiti":1,"busi":2,"away":1,"us":2,"thing":2,"engag":1,"consist":1,"enter":2,"select":1,"gender":3,"space":5,"record":2,"feel":1,"core":2,"tcg":2,"spring":1,"bit":1,"journey":2,"teenag":1,"gas":1,"listen":1,"jump":1,"begin":1,"experi":1,"goldberg":3,"daili":1,"inher":1,"write":2,"known":1,"internet":4,"lost":1,"success":1,"ecosystem":5,"highlight":1,"astound":1,"usc":1,"tool":1,"woman":3,"thing”":1,"compani":3,"influenc":2,"champion":1,"transport":1,"divers":1,"preach":1,"dig":1,"alli":3,"decid":1,"relationship":2,"curat":1,"tomorrow":2,"spend":1,"enjoy":1,"career":1,"voic":11,"larg":1,"web3":11,"model":1,"make":2,"saw":2,"mean":2,"done":1,"said":2,"learn":1,"struck":1,"pivot":1,"accompani":1,"ownership":3,"factor":1,"investor":5,"lucki":1,"fulli":1,"day":1,"gabi":21,"minecraft":1,"realli":1,"began":4,"nothing”":1,"dedic":2,"purpos":3,"opyn":1,"mute":1,"intersect":1,"data":1,"last":2,"newbi":1,"wonder":1,"variant":1,"power":2,"stori":2,"ident":1,"ever":1,"girl":1,"shit":1,"explor":1,"notic":1,"interconnect":1,"peopl":3,"joy":1,"establish":1,"page":1,"zoom":2,"job":1,"current":1,"fund":2,"thought":2,"–":2,"womenl":1,"concept":1,"famili":2,"publish":1,"newstand":1,"interact":1,"exist":1,"lack":1,"line":1,"grew":1,"other":2,"narrat":2,"retain":1,"way":2,"capit":2,"struggl":2,"go":1,"balanc":1,"project":2,"50":1,"talia":2,"mani":3,"event":1,"earlier":1,"posit":1,"blog":1,"seri":2,"ask":1,"like":10,"lot":2,"halfway":1,"creator":6,"particular":1,"headfirst":1,"2020":1,"year":2,"watch":1,"outlin":1,"often":2,"ultim":1,"writer":2,"doctor":1,"behind":1,"talent":1,"part":3,"“less":1,"research":2,"regan":2,"found":3,"foot":1,"excit":1,"crypto":4,"fulfil":2,"judg":1,"alreadi":1,"truli":1,"mirror":1,"piec":1,"player":1,"fem":1,"instagram":1,"aspect":1,"time":5,"includ":4,"develop":2,"confus":1,"care":1,"“the":2,"portfolio":2,"also":1,"nonbinari":2,"visible”":1,"age":2,"articl":2,"bring":1,"world":2,"onlin":5,"director":1,"didn":1,"decentr":1,"help":2,"senior":1,"stress":1,"“mayb":1,"young":3,"'s":3,"consum":1,"difficult":1,"tell":2,"pandemic–":1,"could":2,"whatsapp":1,"toward":2,"uplift":1,"quick":4,"given":1,"everi":1,"womenfound":1,"focus":1,"fem3":3,"appl":2,"nb":2,"sister":1,"respect":1,"facebook":1,"second":1,"pandem":1,"someth":1,"real":1,"firstcheck":1,"connect":2,"volum":1,"host":1,"well":1,"inform":1,"thrive":1,"tank":1,"genz":1,"nbled":1,"subsequ":1,"“aha”":1,"individu":2,"communiti":4,"moment":3,"motiv":1,"lockdown":1,"earli":2,"ventur":2,"come":1,"spoke":1,"call":2,"role":1,"start":2,"effici":1,"realiz":2,"surround":1,"revenu":1,"introduc":1,"aim":1,"would":3,"encourag":1,"member":1,"deriv":1,"built":1,"recogn":1,"occur":1,"strategi":1,"dynam":1,"peer":1,"two":1,"30":3,"same–":1,"import":2,"sheet":1,"advic":1,"share":3,"live":2,"ensur":1,"store":1,"commit":3,"storytel":1,"educ":2,"infatu":1,"list–":1,"luckili":1,"colleg":1,"digit":3,"runescap":1,"life":4,"associ":1,"longform":1,"take":2,"viral":1,"initi":1,"work":7,"transit":1,"":21,"sort":1,"“like":1,"tumblr":1,"covid":2,"say”":1,"question":1,"onboard":1,"degre":1,"find":4,"highest":1,"economi":4,"name":1,"past":1,"chapter":1,"deeper":1,"place":1,"hope":1,"went":1,"big":1,"build":3,"money”":1,"perceiv":2,"read":1,"especi":1,"brand":1,"sustain":1,"empow":1,"support":3,"valu":2,"app":2,"perspect":1,"resourc":1,"someon":1,"believ":1,"one":3,"excel":1,"roi":1,"use":4,"covid19":1,"oper":1,"refug":1,"week":1,"frequent":1,"you'd":1,"interview":3,"addit":2,"foundat":1,"first":1,"platform":2,"perhap":1,"holi":1}},"19850":{"id":"19850","title":"attending to the other - by Jasmine Wang 🌱","link":"https://jasminewang.substack.com/p/attending-to-the-other?s=r","content":"attending to the other under conditions of algorithmic life\n\nI think of many of the people closest to me as poets, although most of them have never authored anything resembling what’s traditionally deemed a poem. They read as poets to me because they speak with the economy of poetry, concerned primarily with rhythm, timbre, and weight, and practice the special quality of attention that that economy requires.\n\nThey attend to their instrument, playing out language’s particularities and peculiarities. Finding the right words requires both intellectual gymnastics and a careful attunement to the songful dimensions of speech. Ocean Vuong wrote that a metaphor should have both a logical and sensory connection between the origin image and the transforming image. At their best, metaphors can reorient the mind completely, even induce original sight.\n\nThey also attend to the object of their instrument. There’s the famous Daoist story of the butcher who never had to sharpen his axe , since he had studied the object of his instrument so closely that the blade slid cleanly through flesh, never encountering bone. One of my closest friends says his love language is deep attention. When I’m confused about a situation, he listens to what I have to say, directs me with careful questions, and then goes away for a few hours. Eventually, he comes back with a question or framing that slices through my fog. I treasure his speech deeply. The attention that undergirds it stands in sharp contrast to the hastily shared words and online takes generated against a backdrop of common knowledge that attention is both scarce and low quality.\n\nSimone Weil, the great French mystic who fasted to death in solidarity with frontline soldiers, said that “attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity”. A few years ago I attended a workshop in Northern California. One evening, we were asked to try social experiments to expand our comfort zones. I decided to sit apart from the party and be visibly alone. After a few minutes, I began, without any verbal communication, to hold the gaze of someone I had met just a few days prior. I knew I was part of his eye-gazing experiment. The world fell away as I watched his eyes watch me. There was an internal shift when I realized I did not have to perform or act in order to be attended to. Marina Abramovic, the grand matriarch of durational performance art, created this feeling for hundreds of people with her work, The Artist is Present, and many were moved to tears. Watch this video and come back.\n\nIf you’ve been lucky enough to have had a deep relationship with another human being, you know what pure attention and witness feel like. The poet David Whyte said that \"the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self. The ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone, and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them, and to have believed in them, and sometimes, just to have accompanied them, for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone\". I can play all the iterated vulnerability games I want with someone, but I only truly feel well with them if we’ve reached the plateau state where both parties feel intrinsically worthy of the other’s attention. Weil said that “absolutely unmixed attention is prayer”. To attend to something properly is to resacralize it.\n\nI’m partly fascinated by attention because my own is awful. I flit between thought to thought, a moth thirsty for light. Like many others, my attention has been challenged by the pandemic. Most of the discourse on attention is framed in terms of productivity. Someone told me anxiously over dinner last week that she isn’t able to focus on her work like she used to be able to. I reassure her, and think to myself that attention is important for all sorts of other reasons. When I walked through the subway to meet her at this restaurant, I felt the skin of my scalp tightening under the hum of the bright fluorescent lights, and my shoulder muscles squeeze in response to an especially dirty stairwell. Now that I am sitting here in a warmly lit space with a new friend, my body is looser, and more porous in some ways. I take on the lilt of her speech. Trying to articulate a novel thought, I feel my way towards the right handle with the entirety of my body, imagine how words would taste in my mouth, how they fit the shape of this new uncharted luminosity. Sometimes, the precise phrase comes easily. Other times, I bumble, throw words around, see what sticks. In these awkward moments when the right words do not arise, if I’m comfortable with who I’m with, I simply hold my tongue.\n\nWeil was part of a particular lineage of ethical psychology that conceptualized the ethical agent as a witness; the primary responsibility is not to change the world but to understand, in contrast with the Humean lineage that describes the ethical agent as an actor, whose primary responsibility is to change the world. It was nontrivial, however, to achieve the sort of clear perception she spoke of; among other things, it required an integrated character.\n\nWitnessing and attending sound passive, but it is far from easy to achieve clear perception, to truly and deeply see.\n\nThis practice feels urgent. Weil believed that simple attention was required for moral attention, which was required for empathy, which was required for ethical action. We are unable to act ethically towards that which we have not first attended to; this includes other humans, but also the non-human other. The art of attention requires, among other things, an openness to being moved and transformed, the development of language, and the resistance of algorithmic life.\n\nOne way to practice attention is to notice the non-logical aspects of communication. Attunement to the melodic quality of our language draws those we are in dialogue with to be more in tune with their own senses, and opens our own ears to the sonority of other creatures. Read a poem today, perhaps ​​this one that describes the limits of the language, and feel it in your mouth. Speak out different beliefs (“I’m sitting on a bed in Brooklyn”, “I’m a woman”, “I’m rich”, “I’m poor”), and see how your body feels after each one. An ambitious Bay Area research group aimed at reinventing psychology called that practice belief reporting. It reminds me in some ways of a theatre exercise I used to do called “voicefinding”. The goal was to find your natural voice. If you’d like to try it, place your fingers right above where your jaw curves into your neck. Start humming with the highest part of your range, and move downwards, while moving your voice placement through your facial mask, throat, then chest. There should be a placement where your voice shifts and changes from something like a string harmonic to a fuller timbre. The first time I did this was remarkable. I suddenly noticed overtones in my voice that I didn’t realize were missing. Others noticed the difference too; I was only fourteen, but people thought I was already in university.\n\nThere’s an apocryphal story of a man who cried moving through a major New York art gallery from piece to piece. Patrons, who preferred to nod sagely at various works and shake their heads slightly at others, became increasingly disturbed as his reactions became gradually more intense. Eventually, the gallery management asked him to leave. I wonder at the depth of his feeling, and his lack of fear of expressing it in public. Two years ago, my mind was gently then suddenly rubbed raw by various philosophical conundrums, and I spent a few days extremely open to all stimuli: I cried listening to jazz, upon understanding a particularly difficult math equation, walking up a grand set of stairs. I was in an elevated state of receptiveness that people have induced for millennia, and that performance artists like Abramovic have practiced to achieve incredible feats of endurance that transcended the needs of the body.\n\nI wonder what Weil’s final week might have been like, if her attention was turned to external forms, internally on her failing organs, or to another plane entirely. Her death reminds me of Han Kang’s The Vegetarian, a beautiful and violent meditation on the body, where a woman wishes for nothing but to become a tree, to feed herself by sunbeams alone. I suspect that if Weil’s attention was in fact directed inwards, that she would not have experienced a dark destruction of form but a sanctifying, warm light.\n\nWittgenstein said that “you cannot enter worlds for which you do not have the language.” Jenny Odell, in How to Do Nothing, discusses how learning the language of birders helped her distinguish better between different birds. One of the most pleasurable parts of learning a new domain for me is developing the language that accompanies the development of taste. This is this sort of chocolate, and I like that more because xyz, this sort of music. There is a delight in finally discovering the exact right label for one’s felt experience. Language facilitates higher levels of attention.\n\nConversely, we are not typically kind to the worlds we do not have language for, or objects that remain illegible to us. Over the last century or so we’ve improved somewhat in our treatment of various peoples. We practice standpoint theory selectively with some groups we are able to communicate with: women, queer folks, people of colour. But we are still unkind to the mentally ill. In Esmé Weijun Wang’s The Collected Schizophrenias, she recounts how she uses legible status labels - bestselling author, Yale honors graduate - to rehumanize herself to both clinical and professional audiences. The mentally ill are terrifying partially because they are illegible and unpredictable. Our conditioned impulse towards them, as it is towards all unknown terrain, is to master, conquer, and make useful. We are so anxious to normalize people to our own baseline. For mood disorders, a patient's mental ‘fitness’ is measured primarily by the degree to which she is able to hold down a 9-5 job. Grandiosity and being ‘overly’ ambitious are markers of narcissistic personality disorder. There are alternative treatment institutions for people experiencing extreme states that follow in the footsteps of psychiatrist R. D. Laing by orienting to these states as teachers. What would happen if we allowed and supported people to traverse the wild skies of joy and the keenest edges of grief and sorrow? What peaks and valleys of human experience would these voyagers be able to chart?\n\nE. F. Schumacher believed that those genuinely interested in inner development would study the lives and works of people for whom “the striving for ‘power’ has entirely ceased and been replaced by a certain transcendental longing”, and who had “broken out of our ordinary confinement of time and space”. Maslow proposed a similar type of psychological research: instead of attempting to understand the inner states of first-year Harvard students, we should study those living at what Maslow called the furthest reaches of human nature.\n\nOne of my friends, who experiences cyclothymia, gave me a beautiful metaphor once about friendship. She thinks of her friends as a tether, not a weight. If she’s feeling hypomanic, she hopes that her friend’s first instinct is not to warn her not to fly too close to the sun. Let her be generative, expansive, magical. Don’t aim to pop the balloon, but hold its attached string carefully. Trust that she will come back to earth eventually, or even better, find ground on an entirely different planet.\n\nPhilosophers like Yuk Hui trace this tendency to reduce the illegible other to a ‘resource’ to something deeply ingrained in Western cosmology itself, where man conceptualizes himself as apart from and independent of the world. The world is an ‘other’, a blank slate upon which his will is executed. Heidegger’s definition of technology was that it ‘revealed’ the world as a resource. This definition of technology, where humanity employs technology to ‘make use of’ the world, is predicated on an oppositional relationship between man and world. Hui is interested in how an Eastern cosmology might change, or completely redefine, the ontology of the self-other relation, so that the self and the other are interdependent.\n\nEven if we choose to retain a clean self-other distinction, Buber offers a challenge to the instrumentalizing worldview. He calls the way we typically relate to the other an I-It relation. We try to collapse the other into an easily legible measure, or set of measures - how tall is the tree? How does it look? What species is it? - and by doing so “the tree remains ‘your’ object and has its place and its time span, its kind and condition”. Instead, he calls for us to allow ourselves to be drawn into a reciprocal relationship with the tree, where we see the tree in its entirety. “Whatever belongs to the tree is included: its form and its mechanics, its colors and its chemistry, its conversation with the elements and its conversation with the stars”, all of the tree, confronting us bodily.\n\nThe sociologist Hartmut Rosa calls a similar mode of relating resonance. Instead of viewing ourselves as closed off, independent systems bent on controlling the other, we should leave ourselves open to being affected by the world, responsive to its call, and thereby allow ourselves to transform and be transformed by it. This orientation reminds me of how one must approach a poem if one hopes to be moved by it; you can analyze it and justify the artifact rationally, but in the end you must encounter the poem bodily, as a totality.\n\nWe must learn to attend without language for what it is we are experiencing. There are so many worlds that we do not have language for, that perhaps humans will never develop language for, strain as we may. So many beings -- animals, trees, mountains, and rivers -- have no place in any sign system we might design, no expressive agency in any human semiotic. To encounter the other, we can develop language, yes, but we should also learn to open our hearts and bodies to the speech of breath, beak, and branch. We must sensitize ourselves to the poetics of everything.\n\nThe American environmentalist Paul Shepard said ‘the grief and sense of loss, that we often interpret as a failure in our personality, is actually a feeling of emptiness where a beautiful and strange otherness should have been encountered.’ How many illegible others, human and nonhuman, have perished because we did not attend to them properly? I think of the terrifying rates of species extinction, as well as the disproportionate death rates of queer, racialized, and otherwise marginalized bodies. How many have not perished, but are reduced in some way, smaller versions of the beings they might have been? A polymathic economist who I consider a mentor tells me he is especially intrigued when he meets someone who is clearly bright and sensitive but inarticulate, and I think of my friends who have downregulated their life force in an effort to be legible instead of remaining moths . How many beautiful and strange possible worlds are we on track still yet to lose?\n\nI think the stakes here are both enormous and invisible. If we do not nurture and practice attention, we will lose everything, and we will not even be aware of what it is that we have lost. We will lose any sense of sacredness. We will ignore real atrocities . We’ll feel an ongoing vague sense of disconnection, loss, and grief as our senses, tastes, and judgment are dulled by a blanket of algorithmic threads. Attention is not sufficient, but I think it is a prerequisite for all that is good and valuable and worth living for.\n\nI’ve been thinking about the limits of critique. Critique is constructive if it is conceptually extensible - if others can build upon it, respond to it, engage with it. In considering rhetorical software and its limits, one could make a similar analogy - a truly extensible, interoperable artifact can resonate across several pace layers, especially if it is built on decentralized, long-lasting infrastructure.\n\nI’m excited about the idea of ‘punctuated artifacts’ - e.g. hosting a week-long or month-long retreat around certain themes, then generating a set of related artifacts, be it a series of letters or a magazine or a gallery.

a New Old Home: Beginnings - by Simon Sarris","link":"https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/designing-a-new-old-home-beginnings?s=r","content":"In March of 2018, Simplicity and I bought three small former haying fields overrun with pine trees in southern New Hampshire, just outside a historic village. Our goal was to build a traditional-looking house that we designed.\n\nWe wanted to give attention to aesthetic and functional features that are absent in many newer homes, such as thoughtful use of light, space, ventilation, and some passive cooling. It seemed like it would be possible to design something more attractive and with fewer complications than most new homes. We did not have a large budget, certainly not a typical “custom house” budget, but we figured that with some careful tradeoffs, and by doing some of the finishing ourselves, we could build something modestly beautiful.\n\nThis series will detail our project and what we’ve learned, including what we wish we did differently. We will share as much advice as we can, from how we think about design and planning, down to what we paint with and how we finished our floors. If you plan to build or design your own home, we hope you will find it useful.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it is because parts of this series were originally published on Medium. They are being expanded and completed here.\n\nOur original plan was to buy an old home and renovate it. We expected to teach ourselves a number of skills by working with a house that needed care and improvements, and then maybe 10 or 15 years later, we might be ready to build our own. I still think this is the preferred route, and underrated for most young couples who enjoy spending time trying to make something beautiful. Fate veered us differently, however. In the next town over from my birthplace we made two offers on 1800’s homes, and backed out of both upon inspections during which we discovered there was hopelessly too much to fix for our budget.\n\nNear to one of the houses we had hoped to buy, there were a few acres for sale. The land was overrun with pines and vines (including poison ivy), but it was quite pretty. It was within walking distance to the village, with one side up against a small forest, and you could easily tell it was a former pasture. Its setting had the rare quality of feeling both open and secluded. With love and attention we had no doubt it would be beautiful.\n\nIn fact, compared to most “building lots” it had such potential for a pretty setting that we were surprised to find the land had been on the market for almost two years when we stumbled upon it. The land was expensive, however, and used up a large part of our prospective budget. Some things are worth overpaying for, even if you have to compromise elsewhere. It is nice to have a rare occasion when the choice is so clear.\n\nWith plenty of hope and a little delusion, we set about figuring out what a construction loan would be like, and how far a budget could go if we built something as beautiful yet simple as possible. We did not aim to build a minimalist house, but we would accept an austere beauty over a compromising ugliness, with the hope that it would grow as we do.\n\nThe clearest tradeoff we could make was to do all the landscaping ourselves. After the sale, each day after work and every weekend, we would go to the land to cut down trees with axes and electric chainsaws. Eventually a friend with a tractor sped this up, especially with moving brush. But rather than steamroll the land into open space, we have tried to work slowly and on-foot when possible, saving alders, blueberries, and wild flowering crabapple trees We knew it would take years to discover everything that is truly here, and want to keep as many of its secrets as possible.\n\nBefore we go over our learning and planning for a traditional home, it’s important to take a scrutinizing look at modern homes. I want to talk about the process of making a home without wallowing in complaints about modern housing, but they must be mentioned just enough to give you an idea of all the things we hoped to avoid. I think most people have an intuitive sense that older homes are often special, and newer ones are often not, even if the reasons are not immediately obvious. (Of course some of this is just survivorship bias: Many uninspiring old homes existed, but did not last.)\n\nGrowing up in an 1840’s house in New Hampshire, many features of modern homes stand out immediately:\n\nThey seem designed primarily to maximize one thing: the square-footage number that will be on the listing when it’s sold. Maximizing for this not only comes at the cost of everything else on the budget, it also leads to ridiculous room designs, random chasms, and dead space. An eye towards making the best sale does not create the best living space.\n\nCarpet has replaced wood flooring. $1/sqft tile (or linoleum) has replaced the rest. Very cheap looking tile fills even expensive homes.\n\nHardware is of poor quality, even in half-million-dollar-plus homes. Cheap and ugly faucets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and paper-thin doors dominate. While somewhat understandable in the least expensive new construction, it’s surprising to me to find these things in more expensive homes.\n\nWhile many modest old homes have low ceilings, you’ll still find ceilings both unnervingly too low and way too high in modern homes, such as sudden 2-story living rooms, or 2-story “lawyer foyer” entryways. They exist out of all proportion with the rest of the house.\n\nAvailability of electric light has allowed builders to ignore the sun. They do this to such an extent that some modern homes need the lights turned on at almost all times, for example, to use a kitchen in the morning at breakfast. Many rooms have few or only one window, while hallways often have none at all. Often windows (or the lack thereof) offer neither good light, nor a view, nor provide a pretty façade from the outside.\n\n“Forced air” duct heating and cooling has allowed builders to ignore window-based ventilation. Modern homes have almost no concept of airflow outside of these systems. Even in houses with central air systems, rooms get too hot, or too cold, and people living in the houses sometimes must install window AC units (in houses that already have central air!) or keep windows open in the winter to moderate these failures.\n\nThere are more subtle aesthetic problems.\n\nAs the availability of stores like Home Depot (founded 1978) and Lowes (21 stores in the 1960’s) spread — both have over 2000 stores each today — the commodification of house hardware intensified. Today it is easier to find the things you are looking for quickly, for example if you need a replacement doorknob. This also means that everyone’s doorknobs look exactly the same. As manufacturers and distributors consolidate while carrying only a few brands, the details of houses homogenize. As they converge in style, people stop considering the hardware as a choice at all, and so everything becomes even more of the same. Through this sameness the hardware became a cost that could now be cut.\n\nStandardization is typical of the aesthetic deep state: before you can choose any options, you are limited by which choices are even available. In theory, availability through the internet could put a stop to this. It’s easier than ever to find small companies making nicer, more interesting hardware, and it’s easier to find antique hardware via eBay, Etsy, and companies that salvage old house parts, or make restoration and period hardware. But builders don’t care, which leads us to the next problem.\n\nHomes are not built by people intending to live in them. Instead, they are built by builders, who mostly want to flash-form “units” —as many as possible, as fast as possible, out of sticks and drywall. Everything from sunlight to cabinet pulls becomes not just an afterthought, but a non thought. The major architectural decision is how to maximize square-footage, over all else, in order to maximize sale price. This is because at some point in the past consumers wanted more space, and space (considered as square-footage) was an easy, legible metric to aim for. It is so integral today that every real estate site will put exactly three details next to the price, and it is one of them:\n\nThe other variables faded into the nondescript sameness of whatever the big suppliers were selling. Since housing is not exactly a commodity, and new construction is dominated by bigger developers, this is hard to change, even if all new house buyers would prefer something wildly different than such a status quo.\n\nOne might think that custom and expensive homes would be in a class above. This is not nearly as true as I’d expect. So many bad homes have been built in the last 70 years that it appears even high-priced home designs do not consider aesthetics or the elements. I suspect this is partly because the customer still does not demand it, and partly because few builders are actually thinking very much when they design houses, instead they are aping other designs, and the designs they are aping are often the poorly-conceived McMansions.\n\nThis million dollar new construction house is at least trying to avoid the typical McMansion exterior aesthetic faults, but still has glaring deficiencies: Bedrooms 2 and 3 contain only one window each, and all the hallways (three masses) contain a single outside window between them, in the stairwell itself. There’s a square mass of upstairs hallway labeled Loft that is larger than the bedrooms, which is not the only useless hallway on display. This is new construction over a million dollars, and the listing gives no indication of where the sun is coming from, or any orientation info at all. They can’t imagine you’d care. Only from spying on Google Maps or the tax map can we sort-of guess that the bathroom, which has more windows than any upstairs bedroom (at two), will perhaps receive the southern sun. The hallways will have almost zero sun, and the ventilation will be provided from the basement.\n\nI don’t want to dwell on bad homes. For that McMansion Hell by Kate Wagner has written quite a bit about the subject. But I do want you to have enough context to understand what we’re running from as we designed ours. Aside from the above complaints, many modern homes are simply ugly, inside and out. This is sometimes because they are too simple, but often it is the opposite: The pile of masses that are added to increase square footage often accompany useless cascading gables, complicated roof lines, cluttered features, and sometimes comical proportions.\n\nNow we have covered enough of the why. The next post in this series will be about how we started—and what you can do—to develop your visual thinking and prepare as much of a design as possible before talking to any builders or architects.\n\nThis newsletter is called The Map Is Mostly Water, and is about a number of topics .\n\nThis house design post is part of a series inside that newsletter, called Everyday Aesthetics .\n\nIf you want to see more photos of our house and the land, there are lots on Twitter , and also on my Instagram and Simplicity’s Instagram , though you may have to rummage through a lot of baby pictures and building projects to find them.

Bento Society","link":"https://bentoism.org/about","content":"\"A welcoming space for people to rejuvenate themselves and co-imagine the world together\" — Julian, member of The Bento Society\n\nBentoism is the theory that self-interest is multi-dimensional. Today we see self-interest in terms of short-term individualism. What I as an individual want right now. While this perspective is in our self-interest, it falls short of capturing the whole picture.\n\nBentoism (an acronym for BEyond Near Term Orientation) is a wider lens for what's valuable and in our self-interest. This includes what I as an individual want and need right now (Now Me). But it also makes space for the considerations of our future selves (Future Me), the people we rely on and who rely on us (Now Us), and the next generation (Future Us). All of these spaces impact us and are impacted by us. They are all in our self-interest.\n\nThe Bento is a simple and useful tool for making decisions and setting strategies that look beyond a short-term individualistic view. It’s a values processor that filters decisions through the perspective of each dimension of your self-interest. Bentoism was created by Yancey Strickler, the cofounder and former CEO of Kickstarter, and introduced in the book This Could Be Our Future: A Manifesto for a More Generous World in 2019. Learn more about Bentoism's origins here .\n\nThe mission of the Bento Society is to redefine what the world sees as valuable and in its self-interest. The same way short-term individualism and financial thinking are hidden defaults so powerful we hardly notice them today, our mission is to make a multi-dimensional lens for self-interest and values the default point of view by 2050, one generation from now.\n\nWhy 2050 and why this change? Because profound changes in social values happen in generational increments. The people leading the world in 2050 will be Millennials and Generations Y, Z, and COVID. Groups with very different ways of seeing the world than those in charge now. A falling empire — spurred by climate change, inequality, and decaying institutions — will give the 2050 generations the opportunity and unfortunate responsibility to lead humanity's most dramatic shift in a century.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of people in these generations recognize our current path is a dangerous dead end. What we lack is a vision for what to build instead. The Bento is a map to the values and dimensions of this new world.\n\nThe Bento Society will pursue this mission in three ways:\n\nThe Bento Society's Bento lays out our strategy:\n\nThe Bento Society is the global community of people who come together to explore Bentoism. In its first year, the Bento Society hosted more than 100 events for thousands of people from around the world to help them set priorities, share challenges and perspectives, and explore potential futures.\n\nMembers come from all around the world and every walk of life. We are retail workers and artists. Students and professors. CEOs and customer service workers. Health care workers and filmmakers. Scientists and Uber drivers.

Sara Campbell and I adapted the lecture into the piece below.\n\n“In one sense, we are all Keynesians now; in another, nobody is any longer a Keynesian.” — Milton Friedman, 1966\n\nThere’s a lot of reasons it’s perverse to say that web3 has made us all Marxists, but perhaps none moreso than the fact that web3 OGs really hate Karl Marx.\n\nTake, for example, Nick Szabo: scholar, cryptographic guru, and proto-bitcoin inventor, occasionally rumored to be Satoshi, who has bemoaned Marxism for fomenting closed societies. Or to quote Szabo himself, “how fucking pathological can a diseased brain become?”\n\nLikewise, take Ameen Soleimani, creator of Moloch DAO, RAI, and SpankChain—truly one of the most innovative and influential minds in the space—who has gone on record not only agreeing with Szabo, but arguing that “America has been invaded by the Marxist mind-virus” by KGB psyops. “When poor people are told what they want to hear—that they are equal to rich people,” writes Soleimani, “the seed of social unrest is planted.”\n\nBut it’s not just right-wing crypto figures who think web3 is fundamentally, well, unmarxist; crypto’s hyper-marketization means many leftists understand crypto as an accelerated form of capitalism as well. “There are respects in which cryptoeconomics also resembles an opposite of the commons: the enclosure,” Nathan Schenider wrote recently , as “what was once held in common become subdivided into ownable, tradable assets.” For Schneider, this hyperfinancialization takes “things previously difficult or impossible to buy or sell, from cryptographic computing power to real estate in digital games,” and gives them value by making them artificially scarce. It privatizes what could have been freely available to all.\n\nMeanwhile, Cory Doctorow, arguably the most important technologist of the left, has accused DeFi of being “Shadow Banking 2.0,” creating massive risk for the economy while enriching the 1%. “I don't care how distributed the banks are if all the money is owned by the same number of billionaires,” he writes. (Indeed, about .01% of bitcoin owners represent 27% of wealth.)\n\nSo how blue are the cryptopills that would have us thinking web3 could possibly be Marxist? How could we even arrive at that conclusion?\n\nWell, let me try to answer first by way of example, or rather, another overarching question: could communism be… DAOs?\n\nBack in October, I ran an experiment to retweet three passages of Marx’s German Ideology by replacing the word “communism” with “DAO.” You can judge for yourself how well it worked.\n\nHere’s the original: “The communists do not oppose egoism to selflessness or selflessness to egoism… they are very well aware that egoism, just as much as selflessness, is a necessary form of the self-assertion of individuals… Throughout history, the \"general interest\" is created by individuals who are defined as \"private persons.\"”\n\nNote the tension here: the collective only operates as well as it fulfills the self-interested needs and desires of its individual members without ever costing them their sovereignty.\n\nAnd that tension is a recurring one.\n\nThe original: “The real intellectual wealth of the individual depends entirely on the wealth of his real connections. Only then will the separate individuals be liberated from the various national and local barriers… All-round dependence will be transformed by this communist revolution into the control and conscious mastery of these powers, which have till now governed men as powers completely alien to them.” Again, note the paradoxical emphasis on individual sovereignty as the basis for collective liberation.\n\nThat paradox is the point, too, of one final Marxist tweet.\n\nThe original: “The modern state, the rule of the bourgeoisie, is based on freedom of labour. Freedom of Labor is free competition of the workers among themselves. [By contrast,] free activity for the Communists is the creative manifestation of life arising from the free development of all abilities of the whole person.”\n\nOnce again, we sense the same tension. True collective freedom means liberation of the individual to do as they please and are able.\n\nBut note, more broadly, that there is a tension at all—that is, that “Marxism” is not quite so reducible to pat solutions or huff-and-puff sloganeering, nevermind the horrors of 20th century state socialism. For when we understand Marxism not as doctrine but dialectics, a series of tensions and paradoxes, we can understand one of its main points of value: that it’s a framework for questions that may not have any answer at all.\n\nSo for the purpose of this piece, we’ll cover three questions posed by Marx, all encompassing the tension between individual sovereignty and collective collaboration that underlie the three main categories of web3 right now: NFTs, DeFi, and DAOs.\n\nIt’s so obvious a question that it’s challenging to answer: in his writings, does Marx advocate for the abolishment of property and ownership generally? Or does he advocate for the redistribution of ownership to the proletariat — that is, so they can own the means of production?\n\nThe question even runs through a document as doctrinaire as “The Communist Manifesto,” which toggles tortuously between wanting to eradicate property and wanting to hand it over to workers. “The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the abolition of property generally,” Marx and Engels write in The Communist Manifesto , only to add a few lines later, “in this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.”\n\nThis tension haunts the text. Marx and Engels try to paper over it by explaining at various points that communism is just the abolition of private property (not property generally, not to worry union rank-and-filers!), and that the real point is dispossessing the bourgeoisie of their ill-gotten gains. Yet they have no great answer for whether they would destroy workers’ property except to answer, defensively, that it’s a moot point given that history has done exactly that: “the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.”\n\nThis is, clearly, a rhetorical sidestep to avoid the question of worker ownership—because for all “The Communist Manifesto”’s cavalcades of anti-property posturing, we can see Marx’s paradox. For workers to own the means of production means getting rid of ownership as we know it. “With the abolition of the basis of private property,” he writes in The German Ideology , “men get exchange, production, the mode of their mutual relation, under their own control again.”\n\nThe contrary, Marx writes, is a system where “trade rules the whole world through the relation of supply and demand – a relation which allots fortune and misfortune to men, sets up empires and overthrows empires, causes nations to rise and to disappear.” Only Marx would fear the tyranny not of kings, but of… supply and demand. Supply and demand is, in other words, a tyranny of misvaluing the things that matter most to us, whether that’s food or love. NFT critics will recognize the sentiment here: supply and demand assigns values to items not according to what they *mean* to us but rather simply for their scarcity in the market. Web3-native, it seems, Marx is not.\n\nAnd yet. What happens when workers control the means of production?\n\n“As soon as the distribution of labour comes into being, each man has a particular, exclusive sphere of activity, which is forced upon him. He is a hunter, a fisherman, a herdsman, or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; while in communist society, where each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticize after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.”\n\nThe most important means of production is not a factory, it turns out. It’s *time*—and more importantly, our own sense of self that comes from having free time at all. These are what gain us our sovereignty to live the lives we want to lead, to act as hunters, fishers, herdsmen, and critics, without ever being hunters, fishers, herdsmen, and critics, defining ourselves by the role we play in profit creation.\n\nBut notice again that there’s a tension here about the role of the individual and collective—if we’re all doing whatever we want, how is society collectively running? Who is working on the sewers and taking out the trash? Perhaps these are unnecessary if we live in small sustainable communes; Marx only hints that “society regulates the general production.”\n\nBut who is this society?\n\nRather than try to answer that question directly, I wonder if we can reframe it in more familiar terms. For we might argue that this tension—whether to abolish ownership or enable workers to own the means of production—actually reflects a deeper one. Should we aspire to sovereignty as individuals to own our own identity, or in today’s terms, our data and reputation? Or would we each be better off if we relinquished this sovereignty as selfish so that we could better support the collective needs of each other and society?\n\nActually, we can boil down these questions even more to a profound tension at the heart of web3:\n\nDo we want ownership over the products of our labor, or do we want them to be open-source for anyone to use?\n\nOne way to understand this tension is to understand the creator economy over the past decade. Step back, and we can see the creator economy as a kind of progenitor of web3 culture, not only as a product of permissionless, user-generated content (TikTok, Twitter) but of a general move towards a freelance economy and the valorization of the solopreneur, that single individual who works on whatever they like and gets paid for their own work.\n\nThat might sound as though the creator economy has shifted us culturally towards a belief that artists should own the means of production: what is a TikToker if not a Hollywood celebrity who owns the means of production? what are hype houses if not proto-DAOs? But then we remember that the creator economy is actually the product of making work for free to prioritize engagement at scale over the monetization of “100 True Fans.”\n\nStep back farther, and we can see that the creator economy is really the culmination of the failures of the gig economy that’s gained dominance over 40 years with the promise of worker sovereignty and a reality of worker isolation. Initially, freelancing was an attractive proposition for corporations to pay as they needed—or rather, to pay as little as they needed, as David Harvey pointed out in The Condition of Postmodernity: “Employers have taken advantage of weakened union power and the pools of surplus labourers to push for much more flexible work regimes and labour contracts.” The irony is that the creator economy has also proven to be the undoing of those traditional corporations as the hierarchies of the corporate ladder have vanished before a new ideology of working for yourself.\n\nBut in a world where 35% of American workers are gig workers , this promise of being a fisherman, hunter, and critic as we please has also meant an abandonment of structures for steady compensation and support for liability as freelancers have fewer safety nets and less recourse to worker rights than ever — because they’re on their own.\n\nLikewise, the creator economy has promised us a Marx-like vision of anyone successfully becoming an artist, but only by operating through platforms that extract excessive profit from the workers who make them successful. What’s true for Uber drivers is true for TikTokers. This, we might say, has been the cost of freelancers being open-source: their work is used freely by anyone, while the platforms they operate through have remained siloed and deeply monetized.\n\nPut another way: freelancers got the open-source, but platforms got the ownership.\n\nHey.com exec says Apple is acting like ‘gangsters,’ rejecting App Store updates and demanding cut of sales\n\n“I thought you were supposed to wrap the threats in euphemisms or something. But it was pretty clear.”\n\nSo what’s the answer? Web3 is, arguably, a response to the polarized failures of the corporate ladder and the economy, of siloed companies on one side and open-market freelancing on the other. And this is where we return to Marx. Because the promise of independent sovereignty to hunt and fish as we please will only work if there is, indeed, a “society” to “regulate the general production” as well. We can only own our work if we’re also willing to give it up to collective benefit to provide for each other.\n\nDAOs, clearly, are one answer here that we’ll return to in a bit—a kind of consensual-state-as-company that lets us earn fully for our work while sharing it permissionlessly and abolishing individual ownership over it.\n\nBut the simpler model is an NFT.\n\nOn the one hand, NFTs represent creators finally getting paid directly for their work. On the other hand, this ownership is clearly a social construct over an infinitely replicable jpeg that is very much open source.\n\nIn other words, NFTs give us one vision of what it can mean for creators to own the means of production (their art) and capture the full value that they produce, even while the work itself is not private property at all but open to all.\n\nNFTs abolish ownership to enable it for creators—for workers.\n\nThe question of ownership is a much larger one than just assets. It’s also a question of whether we should own our own money away from the power of centralized institutions like banks and even governments that have used it to fund everything from subprime mortgages to war. Or does that open the way for what we might call roller coaster sovereignty—that is, massive financial abuse, money-laundering, hacks, con artists, and extreme volatility without government regulation?\n\nIn other words, are we our own best financial custodians?\n\nMore technically, what we’re asking is whether liquid capital is at the heart of capitalism’s contradictions—or actually the solution to capitalism’s deepest problems? This liquid capital is what Marx in the Grundrisse calls “circulating capital,” that is, capital which can easily be liquified as cash and just as easily converted into goods. Such liquid capital, Marx writes, “is indifferent to every specific form, and can shed or adopt any one of them as equivalent incarnations.” In other words, like a kind of ghost assuming the form of the goods it possesses, liquid capital can take on any shape, and isn’t constrained to a use case or even a specific territory.\n\nFor contrast, let’s isolate some key qualities of *fixed* capital, which can’t be liquified, to see why liquidity might help solve some of the major challenges of capitalism.\n\nRequires extensive investment to build and keep overstocked\n\nAbsorbs surplus value (companies charging more for goods than what they cost to make)\n\nNotice how fixed capital is at the heart of some the most predatory aspects of capitalism historically: overcharging for work, underpaying workers, and continually servicing exorbitant loans for money that doesn’t yet exist but will require the economy to produce more and more money with more and more production in order to meet rates of interest.\n\nLiquid capital, on the other hand, doesn’t have these issues.\n\nCan be used to represent any item or good\n\nCan take on any use\n\nCompletely mobile, liquid capital doesn’t face the friction and costs of time and place such as decay, overstocking, and upfront costs that demand huge amounts of money that must be returned at a premium later.\n\nAnd so, when we define liquid capital this way, we might think of it as something else: digital money.\n\nCan be used to represent any item or good\n\nCan take on any use\n\nIn other words, could digital money, or cryptocurrency, be the solution to the physical world of scarcity?\n\nNot so fast. There’s also an argument that this “pure capital,” this capital untethered from the real-world or actual use, is valuable because it’s what facilitates the systems of loans, surplus value, overstocking, and all the rest. As David Harvey writes about liquid capital in A Companion to Marx’s Capital, it “emerges when money is put into circulation in order to get more money.” Its purpose is breeding more capital, keeping us tethered to a world where we constantly have to work below wage to produce more value to service loans for money that doesn’t yet exist.\n\nSo what happens when totally liquid capital that knows no barriers of time, space, government regulation, or TradFi rails can be deployed instantaneously anywhere in the world however anyone wants? Does operating online enable an economy in which liquid capital doesn’t need to service fixed capital for the first time ever? Or as NFT critics have claimed, does it mean we need to recreate the scarcity dynamics underpinning supply and demand economics in order for digital items to have value?\n\nTo put it another way, are we creating shadow banking 2.0 with all the perils of unregulated criminality, or are we creating Occupy Wall Street 2.0?\n\nRecently, Hilary J. Allen has made a quite compelling case that an economy of liquid currency results in capitalism on steroids. Endless liquidity means overleveraging is easier than ever, and to make things even more financially perilous, there’s no federal bank to prop up cascading margin calls that can result. If every transformative technology has experienced massive financial bubbles that brought down the economy when expectations outpaced innovation, we can only speculate just how truly horrific a crash would be when the next technology itself enables massive, unregulated lending.\n\nFor we can also say that liquid capital enables financial sovereignty since we no longer need intermediaries benefitting from our money. Financial sovereignty, it turns out, applies to anyone who’s ever kept their money in a bank just as well as it does to workers. To return to the labor paradigm, we might imagine that just as workers get paid far below the value they provide to factories, we depositors get paid far below the value we provide to banks historically—despite also having to pay governments to bail them out.\n\nDeFi is predicated on the fact that we no longer have to pay banks for their failures without getting paid for their successes. Because now, we can serve the function of lenders ourselves. In a traditional banking paradigm, you would deposit $1 in a bank that the bank would loan out to someone else, so that you and the other lender would each have $1, with the bank effectively earning off your money by generating $2 in the economy while making you an unwitting, un-consensual, and unearning lender to someone else. (I’m simplifying, but this is the principle of money multipliers and bank runs .) That’s simply not possible in DeFi, where you can either provide liquidity yourself to markets or, if you like, deposit $1 and get a synthetic token representing its worth. Now there’s $2 in the economy as well, but one is fully collateralized, and the other belongs to you.\n\nThis is what we mean when we say DeFi is backed. While it’s clear we’re heading towards a future of undercollateralized loans and crypto generating loans for fixed capital in the physical world, financial sovereignty has given us volatility because it’s enabled us to be our own lenders and market makers—as well as losers in the absence of a state.\n\nWhich begs the question: perhaps we should create money out of thin air to stabilize economic systems? And that leads us to our final section, on DAOs.\n\nTo invest with any expectation of return is to put money in the world and hope more comes out—which raises the question, from where? What is it that generates that new value?\n\nExploitation of the poor and expropriation of the land are two answers, and while Marx’s legacy is often intertwined with the former, his major focus throughout much of Das Kapital is on a third: debt. Debt is, for Marx, fictional capital: an obligation for future money that doesn’t officially exist but that debt itself wills into being. To give an example I gave last year in “Ray Dalio, Marxist,” if I loan my friend $5 and they write me an IOU, I can now potentially use that IOU as collateral or even currency with other friends—so that $10 now exists in place of $5, and even more if we count interest.\n\nWe might expect Marx to decry the whole system of capitalist enterprise as a charade built on IOUs that would collapse the economy were they ever to be serviced. But in fact, Marx makes a crucial distinction here: for Marx, investments in companies—stocks—represent real capital, precisely because they are not IOUs that can “exist twice” as loans and currencies.\n\nThe stocks of railways, mines, navigation companies, and the like, represent actual capital, namely, the capital invested and functioning in such enterprises, or the amount of money advanced by the stockholders for the purpose of being used as capital in such enterprises. This does not preclude the possibility that these may represent pure swindle. But this capital does not exist twice, once as the capital-value of titles of ownership (stocks) on the one hand and on the other hand as the actual capital invested, or to be invested, in those enterprises. — Marx, Das Kapital, III.29\n\nNote the difference between debts and investments. With debt, your $5 loan will always be worth $5 (plus interest), so your IOU can easily become currency or collateral. With investments, however, your $5 can’t be treated as $5 whenever you like: it will only be worth whatever the market deems it’s worth, which can go up or down over time. In other words, investment is different from debt because it doesn’t guarantee you a return of any kind that would require the money to exist twice, first as a quantity to be repaid (the IOU) and second as a quantity being used or lended out (the loan itself).\n\nEven more importantly, investments are not what Marx calls “illusory capital” because they are not “interest-bearing capital,” which Marx defines as nothing more than “an accumulation of claims on production, an accumulation of the market-price.” For the perfect embodiment of such “illusory capital,” Marx points us to state bonds: because bonds require a repayment at interest that they can’t actually be used to generate themselves, they’re effectively creating money out of thin air. (For anyone who associates Marx with specter of 20th century state socialism or believes that he at any point advocates for an all-powerful government to regulate enterprise, the shade he throws at states here should set us straight.)\n\nHowever, there’s a slight catch in public markets that becomes a bigger catch in private markets. Because where does the valuation of that stock come from? Well, it comes from the expected future returns of a company that we hope will do well.\n\nSo we are effectively making money out of thin air. If I invest $2M in your company at a $20M valuation, my $2M is real capital, but the other $18M was just created out of nowhere as a mythical entity we hope will earn its value due to future monetization. These valuations are, like debt, claims on future production.\n\nThat catch doesn’t matter for Marx because there has never traditionally been a way to tap into these claims or use them as capital: as long as the IOU can’t be traded as its own currency, the money doesn’t exist twice. But in DAOs, it suddenly does — because now we’ve replaced stocks with tokens that we can use to trade, buy, or invest (assuming the SEC lets us).\n\nBut there’s another, even bigger point at play — DAOs let *anyone* anywhere create tokens that are essentially claims on future value, and raise capital from whomever they like. Now anybody can have the benefits of illusory capital without the downside of actually having to pay it back with interest.\n\nWe can start to see the risks that DAOs represent to financial systems. Many of these investments will not return their valuation, while the democratization of finance without proper education offers massive opportunities for fraudulent or even failed projects to take advantage of investors who can’t diligence them.\n\nBut even so, by letting us create our *own* currency, DAOs can also help us tap into innovation and investment for our projects in ways that never could happen before web3. Owning your work is one thing. Being able to fund the kind of work you want to do is another — and it’s what enables genuine workers collectives to control funding and dissolve the barriers of labor and capital. Because now you can imagine DAOs “investing” in each other by swapping tokens under agreement to support one another’s projects. In place of a traditional investment ecosystem with capital on one side (investors) and labor on the other (founders), DAO-to-DAO token-swaps mean each side represents both.\n\nDAOs, in other words, embody all the tensions we’ve discussed above: between workers having sovereignty and giving it up to a collective, between liquid capital enabling financial self-empowerment and driving us towards a world in which we live in the illusion of only seeing future investment and returns, between the real capital of investing in a project we create and the illusory capital of using that money to fund future value. If there are no clear answers to these paradoxes, these questions, there is at least the optionality of multiple choices.\n\nAnd it’s that optionality that seems peculiarly, well, Marxist. In an era of massive hyperfinancialization and billion-dollar venture funds, this is perhaps the real point of DAOs, the real reason that in the shadows of corporations and the gig economy, even the VCs all talk like Marxists now: web3’s great aim is not just to let builders take financial sovereignty over what they’re building, but to give everyone the optionality to build according to their own desires.\n\nSpecial thanks to Li Jin and to Bhaumik Patel and Tom White for notes and edits.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

So can inviting too many people to your wedding, or naming your child Muhammad or Medina.\n\nDriving or taking a bus to a neighboring town, you’d hit checkpoints where armed police officers might search your phone for banned apps like Facebook or Twitter, and scroll through your text messages to see if you had used any religious language.\n\nYou would be particularly worried about making phone calls to friends and family abroad. Hours later, you might find police officers knocking at your door and asking questions that make you suspect they were listening in the whole time.\n\nFor millions of people in China’s remote far west, this dystopian future is already here. China, which has already deployed the world’s most sophisticated internet censorship system, is building a surveillance state in Xinjiang, a four-hour flight from Beijing, that uses both the newest technology and human policing to keep tabs on every aspect of citizens’ daily lives. The region is home to a Muslim ethnic minority called the Uighurs, who China has blamed for forming separatist groups and fueling terrorism. Since this spring, thousands of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities have disappeared into so-called political education centers, apparently for offenses from using Western social media apps to studying abroad in Muslim countries, according to relatives of those detained.\n\nOver the past two months, I interviewed more than two dozen Uighurs, including recent exiles and those who are still in Xinjiang, about what it’s like to live there. The majority declined to be named because they were afraid that police would detain or arrest their families if their names appeared in the press.\n\nTaken along with government and corporate records, their accounts paint a picture of a regime that at once recalls the paranoia of the Mao era and is also thoroughly modern, marrying heavy-handed human policing of any behavior outside the norm with high-tech tools like iris recognition and apps that eavesdrop on cell phones.\n\nChina’s government says the security measures are necessary in Xinjiang because of the threat of extremist violence by Uighur militants — the region has seen periodic bouts of unrest, from riots in 2009 that left almost 200 dead to a series of deadly knife and bomb attacks in 2013 and 2014. The government also says it’s made life for Uighurs better, pointing to the money it’s poured into economic development in the region, as well as programs making it easier for Uighurs to attend university and obtain government jobs. Public security and propaganda authorities in Xinjiang did not respond to requests for comment. China’s Foreign Ministry said it had no knowledge of surveillance measures put in place by the local government.\n\n“I want to stress that people in Xinjiang enjoy a happy and peaceful working and living situation,” said Lu Kang, a spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, when asked why the surveillance measures are needed. “We have never heard about these measures taken by local authorities.”\n\nBut analysts and rights groups say the heavy-handed restrictions punish all of the region’s 9 million Uighurs — who make up a bit under half of the region’s total population — for the actions of a handful of people. The curbs themselves fuel resentment and breed extremism, they say.\n\nThe ubiquity of government surveillance in Xinjiang affects the most prosaic aspects of daily life, those interviewed for this story said. D., a stylish young Uighur woman in Turkey, said that even keeping in touch with her grandmother, who lives in a small Xinjiang village, had become impossible.\n\nWhenever D. called her grandmother, police would barge in hours later, demanding the elderly woman phone D. back while they were in the room.\n\n“For god’s sake, I’m not going to talk to my 85-year-old grandmother about how to destroy China!” D. said, exasperated, sitting across the table from me in a café around the corner from her office.\n\nAfter she got engaged, D. invited her extended family, who live in Xinjiang, to her wedding. Because it is now nearly impossible for Uighurs to obtain passports, D. ended up postponing the ceremony for months in hopes the situation would improve.\n\nFinally, in May, she and her mother had a video call with her family on WeChat, the popular Chinese messaging platform. When D. asked how they were, they said everything was fine. Then one of her relatives, afraid of police eavesdropping, held up a handwritten sign that said, “We could not get the passports.”\n\nD. felt her heart sink, but she just nodded and kept talking. As soon as the call ended, she said, she burst into tears.\n\n“Don’t misunderstand me, I don’t support suicide bombers or anyone who attacks innocent people,” she said. “But in that moment, I told my mother I could understand them. I was so pissed off that I could understand how those people could feel that way.”\n\nChina’s government has invested billions of renminbi into top-of-the-line surveillance technology for Xinjiang, from facial recognition cameras at petrol stations to surveillance drones that patrol the border.\n\nExperts believe this surveillance video, which shows a Chinese street intersection, uses artificial intelligence and deep-learning for face, body, and behavioral recognition. However, BuzzFeed News couldn’t independently verify that the video was created by SenseTime Group as shown in the video.\n\nChina is not alone in this — governments from the United States to Britain have poured funds into security technology and know-how to combat threats from terrorists. But in China, where Communist Party–controlled courts convict 99.9% of the accused and arbitrary detention is a common practice, digital and physical spying on Xinjiang’s populace has resulted in disastrous consequences for Uighurs and other ethnic minorities. Many have been jailed after they advocated for more rights or extolled Uighur culture and history, including the prominent scholar Ilham Tohti .\n\nChina has gradually increased restrictions in Xinjiang for the past decade in response to unrest and violent attacks, but the surveillance has been drastically stepped up since the appointment of a new party boss to the region in August 2016. Chen Quanguo, the party secretary, brought “grid-style social management” to Xinjiang, placing police and paramilitary troops every few hundred feet and establishing thousands of “convenience police stations.” The use of political education centers — where thousands have been detained this year without charge — also radically increased after his tenure began. Spending on domestic security in Xinjiang rose 45% in the first half of this year, compared to the same period a year earlier, according to an analysis of Chinese budget figures by researcher Adrian Zenz of the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. A portion of that money has been poured into dispatching tens of thousands of police officers to patrol the streets.\n\nIn an August speech, Meng Jianzhu, China’s top domestic security official, called for the use of a DNA database and “big data” in keeping Xinjiang secure.\n\nIt’s a corner of the country that has become a window into the possible dystopian future of surveillance technology, wielded by states like China that have both the capital and the political will to monitor — and repress — minority groups. The situation in Xinjiang could be a harbinger for draconian surveillance measures rolled out in the rest of the country, analysts say.\n\n“It’s an open prison,” said Omer Kanat, director of the Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, an advocacy group that conducts research on life for Uighurs in Xinjiang. “The Cultural Revolution has returned [to the region], and the government doesn’t try to hide anything. It’s all in the open.”\n\nA blacksmith works under watch of a police guard in Kashgar.\n\nOnce an oasis town on the ancient Silk Road, Kashgar is the cultural heart of the Uighur community. On a sleepy tree-lined street in the northern part of the city, among noodle shops and bakeries, stands an imposing compound surrounded by high concrete walls topped with loops of barbed wire. The walls are papered with colorful posters bearing slogans like “cherish ethnic unity as you cherish your own eyes” and “love the party, love the country.”\n\nThe compound is called the Kashgar Professional Skills Education and Training Center, according to a sign posted outside its gates. When I took a cell phone photo of the sign in September, a police officer ran out of the small station by the gate and demanded I delete it.\n\n“What kind of things do they teach in there?” I asked.\n\n“I’m not clear on that. Just delete your photo,” he replied.\n\nBefore this year, the compound was a school. But according to three people with friends and relatives held there, it is now a political education center — one of hundreds of new facilities where Uighurs are held, frequently for months at a time, to study the Chinese language, Chinese laws on Islam and political activity, and all the ways the Chinese government is good to its people.\n\n“People disappear inside that place,” said the owner of a business in the area. “So many people — many of my friends.”\n\nHe hadn’t heard from them since, he said, and even their families cannot reach them. Since this spring, thousands of Uighurs and other minorities have been detained in compounds like this one. Though the centers aren't new, their purpose has been significantly expanded in Xinjiang over the last few months.\n\nThrough the gaps in the gates, I could see a yard decorated with a white statue in the Soviet-era socialist realist style, a red banner bearing a slogan, and another small police station. The beige building inside had shades over each of its windows.\n\nA propaganda poster on the walls of a political education compound in Kashgar reads, “Cherish ethnic unity as you cherish your own eyes.\"\n\nChinese state media has acknowledged the existence of the centers, and often boasts of the benefits they confer on the Uighur populace. In an interview with the state-owned Xinjiang Daily , a 34-year-old Uighur farmer, described as an “impressive student,” says he never realized until receiving political education that his behavior and style of dress could be manifestations of “religious extremism.”\n\nDetention for political education of this kind is not considered a form of criminal punishment in China, so no formal charges or sentences are given to people sent there, or to their families. So it’s hard to say exactly what transgressions prompt authorities to send people to the centers. Anecdotal reports suggest that having a relative who has been convicted of a crime, having the wrong content on your cell phone, and appearing too religious could all be causes.\n\nIt’s clear, though, that having traveled abroad to a Muslim country, or having a relative who has traveled abroad, puts people at risk of detention. And the ubiquity of digital surveillance makes it nearly impossible to contact relatives abroad, according to the Uighurs I interviewed.\n\nOne recent exile reported that his wife, who remained in Xinjiang with their young daughter, asked for a divorce so that police would stop questioning her about his activities.\n\n“It’s too dangerous to call home,” said another Uighur exile in the Turkish capital, Ankara. “I used to call my classmates and relatives. But then the police visited them, and the next time, they said, ‘Please don’t call anymore.’”\n\nR., a Uighur student just out of undergrad, discovered he had a knack for Russian language in college. He was dying to study abroad. Because of the new rules imposed last year that made it nearly impossible for Uighurs to obtain passports, the family scraped together about 10,000 RMB ($1500) to bribe an official and get one, R. said.\n\nR. made it to a city in Turkey, where he started learning Turkish and immersed himself in the culture, which has many similarities to Uighur customs and traditions. But he missed his family and the cotton farm they run in southern Xinjiang. Still, he tried to avoid calling home too much so he wouldn’t cause them trouble.\n\n\"She would never talk like that. It felt like a police officer was standing next to her.\"\n\n“In the countryside, if you get even one call from abroad, they will know. It’s obvious,” said R., who agreed to meet me in the back of a trusted restaurant only after all the other patrons had gone home for the night. He was so nervous as he spoke that he couldn’t touch the lamb-stuffed pastries on his plate.\n\nIn March, R. told me, he found out that his mother had disappeared into a political education center. His father was running the farm alone, and no one in the family could reach her. R. felt desperate.\n\nTwo months later, he finally heard from his mother. In a clipped phone call, she told him how grateful she was to the Chinese Communist Party, and how good she felt about the government.\n\n“I know she didn’t want to say it. She would never talk like that,” R. said. “It felt like a police officer was standing next to her.”\n\nSince that call, his parents’ phones have been turned off. He hasn’t heard from them since May.\n\nA Uighur man stares at a police station from a balcony in Kashgar.\n\nSecurity has become a big business opportunity for hundreds of companies, mostly Chinese, seeking to profit from the demand for surveillance equipment in Xinjiang.\n\nResearchers have found that China is pouring money into its budget for surveillance. Zenz, who has closely watched Xinjiang’s government spending on security personnel and systems, said its investment in information technology transfer, computer services, and software will quintuple this year from 2013. The growth in the security industry there reflects the state-backed surveillance boom, he said.\n\nHe noted that a budget line item for creating a “shared information platform” appeared for the first time this year. The government has also hired tens of thousands more security personnel.\n\nArmed police, paramilitary forces, and volunteer brigades stand on every street in Kashgar, stopping pedestrians at random to check their identifications, and sometimes their cell phones, for banned apps like WhatsApp as well as VPNs and messages with religious or political content.\n\nOther equipment, like high-resolution cameras and facial recognition technology, is ubiquitous. In some parts of the region, Uighurs have been made to download an app to their phones that monitors their messages. Called Jingwang, or “web cleansing,” the app works to monitor “illegal religious” content and “harmful information,” according to news reports.\n\nA tweet shows officials in Xinjiang checking phones for the installation of an app that monitors the content of their phones.\n\nThe internet is painfully slow in the region. Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, has also documented the use of a DNA database targeting Uighurs as well as political dissidents and migrants, along with the use of voice pattern recognition.\n\nWhen I walked into a checkpoint a few miles east of Kashgar, a police officer stood near the entrance to check commuters’ cell phones for banned apps and messages (as a foreigner I was sent to a separate line and not asked for my phone). Their faces were then scanned by a facial recognition camera and matched with their identification cards. Glossy white machines for full-body scans stood on the other side of the room.\n\nPetrol stations have a similar setup. At a station I visited in Kashgar in September, visitors were stepping out of their cars to have their faces scanned and matched with identity cards before filling up. As a foreigner, I was only asked for my passport.\n\n“Because Xinjiang is not stable, we have been able to sell a lot to the government authorities there,” said the owner of a small Beijing-based company that manufactures surveillance drones and other security equipment for Chinese law enforcement agencies. Xinjiang, he said, uses the drones near its western borders.\n\nThe government relies on contracting with companies like Beijing Wanlihong Technology Company, which produces an iris-recognition system that it says is more accurate than facial and fingerprint scanning techniques. Wanlihong is involved in a pilot project in Kashgar that includes providing equipment and training.\n\n“The goal of the system is to build a powerful and extensive identity verification system to identify key suspects and initiate an emergency response mechanism in a timely way,” the company says on its website.\n\nThe data could be collected and used to monitor the physical movements of suspicious people on roads, it adds, or combined with their SMS and browsing data obtained from cellular carriers.\n\nLeft: A note in a hotel elevator in Kashgar alerts visitors to slow internet speed. Right: A camera for face recognition at the entrance of a gas station.\n\nUrumqi-based Leon Technology — a company that integrates artificial intelligence into its security services and then provides those services to telecommunications companies and government agencies in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China — saw its earnings grow by 260% in the first quarter of 2017.\n\n“The Xinjiang government is bound to spend large sums of money to safeguard people’s property and the safety of their lives, protecting the region’s peace, development and stability,” it said in an article posted on its website.\n\nJames Leibold, an associate professor at La Trobe University in Australia who is conducting research on security contractors in Xinjiang, said the broader security industry, including both physical policing and surveillance, is now the biggest employer of people in the region.\n\n“Marketers in Shanghai are calling it the golden era of investment in security in Xinjiang,” he said.\n\nLeibold noted that despite the high-tech equipment, it’s still unclear how effective the government is at actually analyzing the large volumes of video and audio recordings. But it’s clear the state is now pouring resources into doing just that — marrying information gleaned from phone tapping, security cameras, and other sources in an effort to create detailed profiles of people.\n\n“In some ways it’s like a high-tech version of the Cultural Revolution, like the social intrusion aspect and the regulations on religious behavior,” Zenz said, referring to the Mao-era movement that’s remembered in part for pitting neighbors against each other in a violent campaign to punish those seen as enemies of the party. “But the comparison breaks down because it’s systematic and deliberate, and low-key — the Cultural Revolution caused a big mess.”\n\n“This is entirely top-down control,” he added.\n\nState-owned companies are using Xinjiang as a testing ground for big data, Zenz said, and Xinjiang has historically been used to test out surveillance technology that is later rolled out in other parts of the country. Many companies have set up R\u0026D labs in the region for this purpose with government backing.\n\n“It’s a kind of frontline laboratory for surveillance,” Zenz said. “Because it’s a bit outside of the public eye, there can be more experimentation there.”\n\nSurveillance in Xinjiang may be particularly harsh, but it’s clear the government is expanding the use of the technology in the rest of the country, too. Outside Xinjiang, facial recognition is already being used increasingly by Chinese law enforcement to catch criminals, according to media reports. At a beer festival in the seaside city of Qingdao in August, 49 people found themselves arrested when cameras matched their faces with a national police database that showed they were suspected of crimes like theft and drug use.\n\n“Those wanted criminals let their guard down when they went to the festival, which doesn’t check for ID,” a local police official told online news outlet Sixth Tone. “But they were not aware that a simple shot of their faces would lead to their arrest.”\n\nIn another big data foray, the government is also working on a “social credit system,” which would put together lots of variables, including patriotism and moral behavior, to assign numerical scores to its citizens.\n\nBut beyond digital surveillance, many said the government has simply flooded the region with personnel dedicated to tracking residents’ every move.\n\nT., a writer, lived in an apartment complex in the regional capital of Urumqi with his wife and daughters until the middle of this summer. (He and his family are now in the US. He asked me not to disclose which city because he was afraid of being identified by the government.) For years, an official representing the neighborhood’s Communist Party committee would visit his home every week and ask a set of questions that soon became mundane: Who had come to visit? Was anyone pregnant? Had anyone changed jobs? She would then report the information to the local police department, he said.\n\nThen in April, the questions changed. The official began to ask whether the family was Muslim, and how they practiced. T. had never been very religious. But he says he respected Islam because it’s a big part of Uighur culture. The family kept a small collection of religious texts on their bookshelves, as well as four prayer rugs. But the questions made him nervous. He told the official he was not a believer.\n\nA month later, the disappearances started. Friends would vanish in the middle of the night, spirited away by police to political education centers. His neighbors began to disappear, he said, one after the other. T. was terrified.\n\nEvery evening he placed an overcoat and a pair of thick winter trousers near the door so he could pull them on quickly if the police came for him — the weather was warm but he was afraid he could be held into the winter months. He gave away the prayer rugs, and in the relative safety of the apartment, he burned every religious book.\n\n“My wife was so upset, she told me, ‘You can’t do that,’” he said. “I told her, what choice do I have? If someone saw them in a public trash bin, it could bring us so much trouble.”\n\nThe first people in T.’s apartment building to disappear, he said, were those who had traveled abroad and returned, particularly to Muslim countries, from Malaysia to Egypt. Then, in June, he says the police began to conduct random checks of pedestrians’ mobile phones at street corners, bus stops, and petrol stations, sometimes downloading their contents to handheld devices.\n\nPolice in Kashgar now have smartphones that scan faces and match with IDs\n\nThe police would dispense warnings to anyone whose phone carried banned apps like WhatsApp and Facebook. Sometimes, he said, police would come to some people’s homes and businesses to check their computers for banned software and content.\n\n“If they find anything in there, it’ll be trouble for you,” he said. “It was a new kind of police — the internet police.”\n\nAbduweli Ayup fled to Turkey in 2015 after repeated detentions in Xinjiang.\n\nCheckpoints have made Abduweli Ayup nervous ever since he was released from prison. The ordeal had been devastating for the bookish 43-year-old, who was jailed in 2013 after he worked to set up kindergartens and other schools teaching children in the Uighur language. (He was formally charged with illegal fundraising.)\n\nAfter 15 months in prison, Abduweli returned home to his wife and two young daughters, and he was hoping things could go back to normal. But one July day in 2015, trouble found him again as he was commuting to work at a checkpoint he must have been through a thousand times.\n\nThe officers who usually waved him through had been replaced by Special Weapons and Tactics police. When they saw his ID papers, they noticed his prison history.\n\nThat’s when they demanded his laptop.\n\n“I said, ‘They know me here. I come here every day,’” Abduweli said. In response, one of the officers slapped him across the face, he said. When the police opened his laptop, they found essays he had written, years before, during an academic fellowship in Kansas. In his writing, he expressed his views on taboo subjects from Uighur culture to dictatorships as a system of government.\n\nAbduweli was detained immediately, strip searched, and interrogated for hours about his writing by a group of six officers, he said.\n\nOne of the officers told him if he was caught with essays like that on his laptop again, he would be sent back to prison.\n\n“That’s when I decided the law here does not exist,” Abduweli said, recounting the story in September at a friend’s apartment in Ankara, where he fled later that year. “I realized if they took my computer again, it would be dangerous. So I knew I had to leave.”\n\nThe government has said repeatedly that its goal in Xinjiang is to achieve both ethnic unity and social stability. Beyond curbs on the Uighur population, it has also provided subsidies for some Uighur workers and affirmative action programs for students to attend top universities, and takes pains to recruit them into government jobs. A significant percentage of the police in Kashgar, for instance, are themselves Uighur.\n\nChina also points to its growing investment in the infrastructure and key industries in historically underdeveloped Xinjiang, including roads, construction, and telecommunications networks.\n\nBut critics say those efforts are overshadowed by the government’s more repressive measures, which have fueled the propaganda of a small number of extremists, including the Turkestan Islamic Party (TIP), a radical Uighur militant group, some of whose adherents are believed to have been active in Syria and Afghanistan. According to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute, TIP released an issue of its online magazine on Aug. 29, calling for its fighters in Syria to prepare for future battle against the Chinese state in East Turkestan, a name many Uighurs use to refer to Xinjiang. The issue sought to draw attention to the situation in Xinjiang and the treatment of Muslims by the Chinese government.\n\n\"I can see it in the younger generation,\" said D., the woman who postponed her wedding because her relatives in Xinjiang couldn't obtain passports in order to attend. \"They are more angry.\"\n\nThese days, Abduweli is trying to finish a children’s book explaining Uighur language and culture to elementary school kids. The pages are illustrated with clip art of generic cartoon children, culled from a Google image search. What the book really needs is a Uighur illustrator who understands the culture, Abduweli said, but because of his status as a former political prisoner, all the really good artists are too afraid to be publicly associated with him.\n\nIn December, the Chinese government abruptly canceled Abduweli’s passport, rendering him stateless. He’s applying for refugee status through the UN in Ankara.\n\nSometimes, he thinks back to his college years in Beijing in the early 1990s, which he remembers as his first real taste of freedom. Abduweli remembers vividly a Chinese-language book he picked up from a street vendor. He loved it so much he biked across the city to a foreign-language bookshop to find the original English version, which he scoured page by page. He felt sure there were parts that the Chinese censors had removed.\n\nThe book was George Orwell’s 1984, and it reminded him, he said, of home.\n\nMegha Rajagopalan is an investigative reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.\n\nGot a confidential tip?

Worldbuilding on the Digital Frontier - Reboot","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/darkforest?s=r","content":"I've read the book Ender's Game at least ten times in the last ten years. There are so many wonderful things about the series, but what I really latched on to—and predated the work I'm currently doing—was the part where Ender's siblings wrote articles on web forums with fake names. I was and am still obsessed with the idea that relatively powerless figures can leverage online information ecosystems to make shit happen on a geopolitical scale.\n\nI think a lot of technologists have something similar to my Ender's Game moment. They come across a creative work—a book, a video game, a movie—that shocks them into imagining the wild utopias and dystopias that technology makes possible.\n\nToday, I'm sharing an interview with my good friend gubsheep. He's a 2020 Thiel Fellow currently building the Dark Forest video game and other zero-knowledge cryptography experiments. Inspired by our last event with Cory Doctorow, I hit him up to chat about his sci-fi inspirations and the design challenges around Dark Forest. Gubsheep also helped create HackLodge , a program for student developers, and he spends his time thinking about crypto, communities, and digital worlds.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat was the first sci-fi book you read that really changed the way you approach your work?\n\nThe seeds of my interest in decentralized technology were planted about five years ago, when a friend gave me a copy of True Names: and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier . It contains the novella True Names by Vernor Vinge and a collection of essays from cypherpunks and other thought leaders in early cryptography.\n\nVernor Vinge was one of the first authors to hypothesize about a digitally interconnected world many years before the early internet. True Names lays out a vision for pseudonymity and anonymity in cyberspace; for example, the idea that because of privacy-preserving cryptography, cyberspace may be much harder for traditional meatspace authorities to exert control over. Like other influential sci-fi books like Snow Crash and Ready Player One, the most powerful people in True Names are totally unassuming in the context of traditional power structures—but wield enormous power in a digital reality. Vinge inspired a lot of writers and technologists to start actually building towards this vision.\n\nSo tell me about what you're working on now!\n\nFor the last 18 months, I've been working on a project called Dark Forest . It's a massively multiplayer, real-time strategy game built on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses new cryptographic technology to make much richer and more dynamic online worlds than were previously possible.\n\nAround 2019, there was an explosion in a subtopic of crypto called zero-knowledge cryptography (ZK crypto), which allows you to perform verifiable computations without showing what data you're performing the computation on.\n\nRight now, there are two applications of ZK crypto that people care a lot about. One is privacy tech, like sending anonymous cash back and forth on the blockchain. The second is scalability tech: there are ways to use the mathematical techniques behind ZK crypto to make blockchains more efficient. But the third application that I'm most interested in—and that there's been very little activity on so far—is using ZK crypto to create games and digital worlds.\n\nCan you explain me how ZK crypto works in the Dark Forest game?\n\nAll games can be divided into two categories: complete information games and incomplete information games. Complete information games are games where everybody knows everything going on, like checkers or chess. Incomplete information games are games like poker or Starcraft where not everybody has full data on the world state. For example, I don't know what's in your hand in poker, and you don't know where my base is located in classical strategy games.\n\nThis distinction matters because incomplete information games often have a much richer and deeper strategy space and more interesting social dynamics to explore. If not every player knows the same thing, you enable emergent social dynamics like deception and conditional coordination.\n\nBut blockchains by design have open and transparent data layers. On the Bitcoin network, you can see a full record of all the transactions that have happened since the beginning of the system. So until ZK crypto was productized, the only games built on decentralized systems were very simple ones like CryptoKitties and other trading card games.\n\nIn 2019, we realized that we could use ZK crypto to make incomplete information games on the blockchain. Now, players can make moves while keeping their private information hidden; that is, a player doesn't need to know exactly where I am to verify that my move was valid.\n\nDark Forest revolves around a common strategy game mechanic and plot device called the \"fog of war.\" You start off at a home planet in a little corner of the universe. Until you have explored some area of the map, you don't know where or whether other civilizations exist. This anxiety—not knowing what's out there, and not knowing who's seen you—drives a lot of the dramatic action.\n\nHow did Liu Cixin's Three-Body trilogy, and specifically The Dark Forest, inspire the storyline for the game?\n\nThis answer is fascinating, but contains mild/vague spoilers for the Three-Body trilogy. We've footnoted it, so scroll to the bottom to read!\n\nDark Forest engages the central questions of politics, international relations, and human nature itself: for example, do you assume that everybody is power-hungry, or do you think empires can use diplomacy to create cooperative bodies like the UN? Since you don't have a formal background in these subjects, I'm curious how you derive your understanding of these issues.\n\nThat's a great question, and my answer is that I don't think we're capable of theorizing about it. We've built a very specific sandbox environment that may or may not bear resemblance to real-world situations. I think the best thing we can do as universe designers is to let people in, see what they do, and try to learn from that.\n\nWe've actually been quite surprised by a lot of player behavior. Coming in, we were anchored off Liu Cixin's Three-Body trilogy, where one of the implicit theses is that everyone is maximally suspicious and maximally cautious. Whereas in the Dark Forest game, a lot of players end up engaging in negotiations, trade, diplomacy, and even alliances.\n\nIt turns out that the communication channels available to players impacts their behavior. For example, we allow players to link their game accounts to their Twitter handles. One thing that organically emerged is that when players ran into each other, before taking any action, they would DM each other to determine if the other person was hostile, friendly, or might even be open to an alliance to wipe out another bigger player. We later moved the community to Discord and created channels where players can broadcast signals to each other.\n\nThe Dark Forest team tries to be fairly hands-off and non-prescriptive about how players should play. I don't think you can stop either players of a video game or players in the grand game of life from doing what they want. We’ve learned that people aren't going to bend to your theorizing.\n\nDo you think that building Dark Forest has made you more optimistic about human nature?\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is very polarizing. You truly get the best and the absolute worst of people. For example, Satoshi and Vitalik are so committed to a vision of open technologies, and they've given up so much in the process. But any system that has economic incentives built in will simultaneously attract the most amoral people: the scammers, the grifters, the pump-and-dump shills.\n\nWe've been trying to be deliberate about constructing a community that self-selects as the former. So far, there aren't any financial mechanisms built into the game, though in the future, there almost certainly will be. And I've been pleasantly surprised that the game attracts developers who want to write code and share it with others—a lot of our third-party developers spend hours a day helping newbies write scripts or understand the Dark Forest plugin system. So this project has actually made me very optimistic for the decentralized universe community.\n\nYou can find more of gubsheep on his Twitter or Dark Forest's Twitter and blog .\n\n🌏 Gubsheep also recommended this New Yorker profile of Liu Cixin , which gets into the sci-fi author's upbringing, modern Chinese politics, and his Machiavellian—or pragmatic—imagination. “I did not begin writing for love of literature,” he says. “I did so for love of science.”\n\n🕸️ Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin breaks down the three types of decentralization : architectural, political, and logical.\n\n🏰 In this podcast, MacArthur genius and fantasy author NK Jemisin teaches Ezra Klein to world-build . I was especially impressed by the way her historical knowledge informs the constraints of her worlds.\n\n💰 The following is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be relied on as legal, tax, or investment advice. (Or should it?)\n\nI've never been a gamer, so I turned to the Reboot Fellows to ask why they game:\n\nKhoi (mentor, Fanhouse founder): Whereas fiction feels like worldbuilding via relationships and imagination; games feel like worldbuilding via roleplay and mastery. Also, when I used to make games, I'd find people do completely unexpected things. It’s harder to interpret fiction in a novel way from the author's intent than to find delight in a game that was unintended by the game designers.\n\nLucas (fellow, Brown 2023): Not my quote, but I thought of Bushnell’s Law, coined by the founder of Atari (Nolan Bushnell): “All the best games are easy to learn and difficult to master. They should reward the first quarter and the hundredth.”\n\nFinally, if you could fill out Reboot's 1-minute feedback survey , that would be awesome. I personally read every single response!\n\nDisclaimer (Aug 2021): Reboot has since received a $5k grant from Dark Forest’s associated foundation.

is Self-Certifying. There’s been a lot of discussion lately… | by Jay Graber | Medium","link":"https://jaygraber.medium.com/web3-is-self-certifying-9dad77fd8d81","content":"Web3 is Self-Certifying\n\nThere’s been a lot of discussion lately about what Web3 is and isn’t. Here’s my definition: Web3 is user-generated authority, enabled by self-certifying web protocols. These are a superset of technologies that include blockchains, but are not limited to them. Is this what other people think “Web3” is? Maybe not, but hear me out.\n\nAuthority on the web establishes who ultimately has control over content. In the earliest stage of the web, there wasn’t usually a separation between “users” and web hosts — whoever hosted a website also put the content on there. In the shift known as “Web 2.0”, sites became popular that gave users accounts to create content, but the site hosts still had the final say and could unilaterally change anything they wanted to. This is mostly how the web works now. In the evolution of the web I’m calling Web3, users can cryptographically assert their identity and publish verifiable content, and sites that host content don’t have the authority to change it, because the root of trust is in the data itself, not in where it is found. To recap:\n\nIn short, these three stages are “the hosted web, the posted web, and the signed web.”\n\nWhat is a “self-certifying protocol?” This is a general term I’m using to describe protocols that have cryptographic user identifiers and content-addressed data. “Cryptographic user identifiers” associate users with public keys. The ability to sign with the corresponding private key is the root of trust proving someone controls an account, rather than an entry in a database keeping track of user logins. “Content-addressed data” means content is referenced by its cryptographic hash — the unique digital “fingerprint” of a piece of data. Putting these two pieces together, a content hash signed by a user key can prove a user authorized its creation, without requiring an intermediary. ​​Self-certifying data enables trust to reside in the data itself, not in where you found it, allowing apps to move away from client-server architectures. This creates “user-generated authority”.\n\nWhat’s the role of blockchains in Web3, if we’re defining it as self-certifying protocols? Blockchains are self-certifying protocols that create consensus on global state, emulating a centralized database without any one party being in control. “User accounts” on blockchains are cryptographic keypairs, used to sign transactions. The “content” is hashes of transactions bundled into blocks, that are themselves hashed and chained together. Transactions are signed with a user’s keypair. What Bitcoin (the first blockchain) introduced was a novel consensus mechanism for mutually distrusting parties to agree on what transactions occurred — very important for digital money without an intermediary.\n\nWhat other protocols have self-certifying properties that are not blockchains? Git, PGP, BitTorrent and Tahoe-LAFs preceded Bitcoin. Among the current generation of non-blockchain self-certifying protocols, IPFS, Hypercore, SSB, Peergos, and Spritely all have user keys and content addressing. In these non-blockchain self-certifying protocols, you can prove a user “owns” content in the sense that it can be verified that they published it. Blockchains introduce a stricter notion of ownership by having a timestamped global ledger everyone agrees on. This lets you assert properties like global ordering and uniqueness, so you can prove only one person “owns” a bitcoin or an NFT at one time. Architecturally, blockchains can be thought of as just one type of datastore in Web3, useful for some applications and cumbersome in others. But financially and socially, they’ve poured attention and resources into the space. Important pieces of Web3 infrastructure that have been built as a result of blockchains include wallets and apps that put keypairs into the hands of millions of users, and tooling for new cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that unlock countless possibilities. It’s understandable why they currently overshadow discussion of anything else, but if the full Web3 vision is to be realized, other kinds of self-certifying protocols will have to be developed.\n\nIf a self-certifying protocol is one that allows authorship of content to be proven directly through user keys and content addressing, a self-certifying web protocol is one that also has content linking and discovery. Algorithms that enable discovery of content are a fundamental part of how we use the web these days, and “Web3” needs to develop more sophistication here if it’s going to provide a good user experience. Things I think are missing or immature: social graphs, user profiles, identity and reputation attestations, content aggregation, indexing and discovery, curation and moderation methods. A confusing part of the term Web3 as applied to blockchain tech is that it’s a lot of disconnected pieces right now, that are missing a lot of features we’ve come to expect from the web.\n\nI would like a broader definition of Web3 to be recognized that includes all self-certifying protocols, of which all blockchains are a subset. But rather than focusing on the terms, let’s try to focus our energy on what properties and characteristics are important as the internet evolves. I want a more user-centric web, where people can generate their own authority to create content without locking themselves into a centralized service. If you agree with this but don’t want to use the term “Web3” for whatever reason, I propose using “Self-Certifying Web Protocol”, or SCWP for short, as a more concrete and technically descriptive term for these technologies.\n\nThanks to everyone who provided thoughts and feedback on this post: Paul Frazee, Daniel Holmgren, Aaron D Goldman, Christine Lemmer-Webber, Andre Staltz, Whyrusleeping, Jenny Kaehms, and more.\n\nLove podcasts or audiobooks?

It’s almost like I like her but I’m not gay, so I don’t get it.” She shows the pages of an old notebook as a caption completes the joke: “Reading my ‘straight’ diary from middle school LMAO.”\n\nI’d spent a few weeks on TikTok by this point, consistently amazed by how quickly the app seemed to sense my taste. We know little about how TikTok’s algorithm works. A cagey corporate blog post titled “How TikTok recommends videos #ForYou” mostly just explains that it watches the way you engage and gradually tailors the stream of videos to your interests. My feed had already begun to fill with “queer” content—music from queer artists, videos of queer couples, and the like—but nothing explicitly about identity. This video took me by surprise.\n\nBy this point, I had a vague notion that I was attracted to men, but had only shared this with a few close friends. I still felt confused and ashamed. I’d just begun to think about how my potential queerness may have played into previous friendships—when the video showed up in my feed, I surged with a sense of uncanny recognition. Suddenly, TikTok seemed like a portal, a place where I could more firmly figure out who I was.\n\nAt the same time, I felt deeply uneasy. As videos about queerness became more common on my feed, I started to feel uncomfortably exposed: How could TikTok know I was bisexual before I fully knew it myself?\n\nFor decades, queer people in the United States have been subjected to surveillance. In 1950, Congress issued a report titled “Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government” after covertly investigating federal employees’ sexual orientation. The report declared homosexuality a mental illness and homosexuals a national security risk; employees suspected to be gay were immediately terminated. The practice was common among private employers, too. Although some states eventually had statutes prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, it wasn’t federally outlawed until June 2020.\n\nOf course, the monitoring also extended to social spaces. Throughout the ’60s, police raids were a frequent ritual of the queer New York nightlife scene. Police officers regularly lined up gender-nonconforming folks and sent those who failed to wear the mandated three pieces of “gender appropriate clothing” to jail. And trans people are still subjected to such scrutiny on a daily basis—in the bathroom, on the playing field, at TSA.\n\nIn this environment, queer people have long worked to craft subtle ways of controlling their own visibility, signaling queerness to each other while remaining undercover to the mainstream. You can see it in customs like the “hanky code” of the ’70s, by which gay men used a system of colored bandanas to covertly flag their sexual preferences. By the ’80s, some of those symbols—the rainbow flag, the pink triangle, the lowercase lambda—became well-known markers of the rising gay liberation movement. Meanwhile, queer people were still seeking intimacy in out-of-view venues—bars, parks, piers. They found community after dark in liminal urban spaces, communicating through lingering eye contact, subtle head nods, the slight twitch of a knowing smile.\n\nOnce the digital age arrived, internet anonymity supplanted the cover of night. Sites like Tumblr and Reddit acted as queer watering holes, as teens across the world poured themselves into blog posts and suggestive GIFs that allowed them to safely bare their souls and build community across distance. In these instances, the platforms were just that—platforms, on which queer people could, using re-blogs and upvotes, determine what mattered to them.\n\nNow, that brings us to TikTok, perhaps our generation’s closest analogue to those earlier platforms and venues. We imagine, however, that something is missing. We’re still finding community and expressing ourselves through shared signals, and (through monitored engagement) by choosing what becomes popular. But ultimately, on TikTok, it’s the algorithm that decides what gets seen and what doesn’t—when we’re visible, and to whom. The practice of coding once intended to maintain discretion has been flipped on its head, incorporated into a system of self-submitted surveillance by an enigmatic AI. To quote writer Eugene Wei, “When you gaze into TikTok, TikTok gazes into you.”\n\nI realized I was queer when I kissed a girl at tennis camp at the age of thirteen. (Or rather, when she kissed me and I liked it.) Although I felt different than I did seven seconds before, no one around me could tell that I had changed. In true Gen-Z fashion, I turned to the internet to learn what queer people looked like and how they went about finding each other. After concluding a pixie-cut would be the surest way to subtly scream “I’m gay,” I spent most of the following years searching for other queer people. I floated through GSA, cuffed my jeans, and eventually “came out” to avoid the constant guessing game of interpreting furtive glances.\n\nWhen I downloaded TikTok during my freshman year of college, the algorithm quickly clocked me. The steady stream of videos about thrifted clothing, cottagecore, and Phoebe Bridgers—along with explicit hashtags such as #wlw (women loving women) and #bisexual—loudly let me know: you’re on “gay TikTok.” But could I call this a “queer community?” The idea of queerness that I stumbled upon was completely disembodied; divorced, even, from sexual identity. It had been optimized—boiled down to a specific sartorial aesthetic, hashtag, and list of micro identity labels—all in the name of being maximally legible to a machine learning algorithm.\n\nIn some ways, I felt seen. But not entirely. While “gay TikTok” served me hashtags like #FemmeBoyFriday—which compiles videos of presumably straight boys dressing up in skirts and dresses for views and cultural caché—what was missing was the forlorn glances, sweaty palms, awkward pauses, terrible first kisses; the stumbling inherent to self-discovery. Meanwhile, a popular meme illustrates the other perspective: “When she start rubbin’ on your thighs but you only gay on TikTok.”\n\nWe will never intimately know a pre-internet queerness. By the time we reached adolescence, Tumblr was already in decline. While we recognize and appreciate the sacrifices made by previous generations that have given us the freedom to be visibly queer, it’s difficult not to romanticize prior forms of queer community, be they in physical or cyberspace. The way those spaces preserved the agency of queer people feels particularly significant.\n\nUltimately, TikTok’s algorithm has one goal: to hold our attention long enough to serve us more ads. The organic formation of “gay TikTok”—and all the content niches—likely serve those same business goals. There’s agency in finding community and meaning in each other’s content, as queer people have been doing with commercial media for decades. Still, there’s an unsettling imbalance of power: while TikTok learns things about us that we may not even share with close friends, its own inner workings are inscrutable. The app can see us, but we can’t see it back.\n\nThis opacity has already proved concerning. In 2019, an investigation by German publication Netzpolitik found that, in certain countries, TikTok had established a list of “special users” (queer, disabled, and fat people) whose videos were regarded as a “bullying risk” by default and capped in their reach, regardless of content. TikTok claims the list has since been retired. Still, the app’s algorithm and affordances automate and shape the ongoing co-production of what it means—and how it looks—to be queer in ways we can’t fully control or discern.\n\nFor many young people, TikTok serves as more than an app; often, it’s a site of self-discovery. And the pressure to fit into a prescribed image of queerness can easily lead you astray. But our forebears remind us that queerness is about self-definition and the freedom to continually redefine. In Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity , José Esteban Muñoz warns against the way that pop culture representations of queerness ossify it, writing, “What we will really know of queerness, does not yet exist.” In other words, while the algorithm may be able to determine what we like, we can’t let it define who we are or predict who we will become.\n\nLucas Gelfond is a writer for Reboot and the College Hill Independent, software engineer, and student at Brown.\n\nAnabelle Johnston is a managing editor of the College Hill Independent and BA candidate in Science, Technology, and Society at Brown University.\n\nThis piece appears in Logic's issue 14, \"Kids\" .

Note","link":"https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/for-the-sake-of-humanity?s=r","content":"Subscribe to this podcast to get a private link for listening in your favorite podcast player. Learn about RSS.\n\nThe following letters are taken from the book, Letters of Note: War ; the audio—read by the wonderful Sanjeev Bhaskar—is taken from the Letters of Note: War audiobook . You can become a paid subscriber of this newsletter to receive these recordings more often.\n\nIn July of 1939, two months before the German invasion of Poland that prompted World War II, Mohandas Gandhi, leader of the Indian independence movement, penned a letter to Adolf Hitler and pleaded for peace ‘for the sake of humanity’. A year later, with the world in turmoil, he wrote again with more force. Unbeknownst to Gandhi, neither of his letters reached the leader of Nazi Germany; instead, they were intercepted by the British Raj. Gandhi was also unaware that in late 1937, in a meeting with government envoy Lord Edward Halifax, Hitler had advised the British to ‘Shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn’t suffice to reduce [the Indian National Congress] to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn’t suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you make it clear that you mean business.’\n\nFriends have been urging me to write to you for the sake of humanity. But I have resisted their request, because of the feeling that any letter from me would be an impertinence. Something tells me that I must not calculate and that I must make my appeal for whatever it may be worth.\n\nIt is quite clear that you are today the one person in the world who can prevent a war which may reduce humanity to a savage state. Must you pay that price for an object however worthy it may appear to you to be? Will you listen to the appeal of one who has deliberately shunned the method of war not without considerable success? Any way I anticipate your forgiveness, if I have erred in writing to you.\n\nThat I address you as a friend is no formality. I own no foes. My business in life has been for the past 33 years to enlist the friendship of the whole of humanity by befriending mankind, irrespective of race, colour or creed.\n\nI hope you will have the time and desire to know how a good portion of humanity who have view living under the influence of that doctrine of universal friendship view your action. We have no doubt about your bravery or devotion to your fatherland, nor do we believe that you are the monster described by your opponents. But your own writings and pronouncements and those of your friends and admirers leave no room for doubt that many of your acts are monstrous and unbecoming of human dignity, especially in the estimation of men like me who believe in universal friendliness. Such are your humiliation of Czechoslovakia, the rape of Poland and the swallowing of Denmark. I am aware that your view of life regards such spoliations as virtuous acts. But we have been taught from childhood to regard them as acts degrading humanity. Hence we cannot possibly wish success to your arms.\n\nBut ours is a unique position. We resist British Imperialism no less than Nazism. If there is a difference, it is in degree. One-fifth of the human race has been brought under the British heel by means that will not bear scrutiny. Our resistance to it does not mean harm to the British people. We seek to convert them, not to defeat them on the battle-field. Ours is an unarmed revolt against the British rule. But whether we convert them or not, we are determined to make their rule impossible by non-violent non-co-operation. It is a method in its nature indefensible. It is based on the knowledge that no spoliator can compass his end without a certain degree of co-operation, willing or compulsory, of the victim. Our rulers may have our land and bodies but not our souls. They can have the former only by complete destruction of every Indian—man, woman and child. That all may not rise to that degree of heroism and that a fair amount of frightfulness can bend the back of revolt is true but the argument would be beside the point. For, if a fair number of men and women be found in India who would be prepared without any ill will against the spoliators to lay down their lives rather than bend the knee to them, they would have shown the way to freedom from the tyranny of violence. I ask you to believe me when I say that you will find an unexpected number of such men and women in India. They have been having that training for the past 20 years.\n\nWe have been trying for the past half a century to throw off the British rule. The movement of independence has been never so strong as now. The most powerful political organization, I mean the Indian National Congress, is trying to achieve this end. We have attained a very fair measure of success through non-violent effort. We were groping for the right means to combat the most organized violence in the world which the British power represents. You have challenged it. It remains to be seen which is the better organized, the German or the British. We know what the British heel means for us and the non-European races of the world. But we would never wish to end the British rule with German aid. We have found in non-violence a force which, if organized, can without doubt match itself against a combination of all the most violent forces in the world. In non-violent technique, as I have said, there is no such thing as defeat. It is all ‘do or die’ without killing or hurting. It can be used practically without money and obviously without the aid of science of destruction which you have brought to such perfection. It is a marvel to me that you do not see that it is nobody’s monopoly. If not the British, some other power will certainly improve upon your method and beat you with your own weapon. You are leaving no legacy to your people of which they would feel proud. They cannot take pride in a recital of cruel deed, however skilfully planned. I, therefore, appeal to you in the name of humanity to stop the war. You will lose nothing by referring all the matters of dispute between you and Great Britain to an international tribunal of your joint choice. If you attain success in the war, it will not prove that you were in the right. It will only prove that your power of destruction was greater. Whereas an award by an impartial tribunal will show as far as it is humanly possible which party was in the right.\n\nYou know that not long ago I made an appeal to every Briton to accept my method of non-violent resistance. I did it because the British know me as a friend though a rebel. I am a stranger to you and your people. I have not the courage to make you the appeal I made to every Briton. Not that it would not apply to you with the same force as to the British. But my present proposal is much simple because much more practical and familiar.\n\nDuring this season when the hearts of the peoples of Europe yearn for peace, we have suspended even our own peaceful struggle. Is it too much to ask you to make an effort for peace during a time which may mean nothing to you personally but which must mean much to the millions of Europeans whose dumb cry for peace I hear, for my ears are attended to hearing the dumb millions? I had intended to address a joint appeal to you and Signor Mussolini, whom I had the privilege of meeting when I was in Rome during my visit to England as a delegate to the Round Table Conference. I hope that he will take this as addressed to him also with the necessary changes.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

The film chronicles Stewart’s extraordinary biography and his present day mission to shift humanity's perspective on technology, space, time, and life itself. The film is accompanied by a timeless original score by Brian Eno. See the trailer above.\n\nThe world dramatically changed in 2020, and so did the way we share and experience stories. We want to be part of the steamroller , taking a crypto approach to distribution that befits the subject of our film himself—a futurist who is always one step ahead.\n\nSo here is our wild pitch: let’s release We Are As Gods by minting NFTs on Mirror! The idea is simple: an NFT will not only allow you to stream the film, but it will also unlock analog artifacts and once-in-a-lifetime IRL experiences, alongside these digital rarities. By releasing the film through blockchain technology, we’re exploring a new distribution model for the future of the film industry.\n\nThese are the words of futurist Stewart Brand in 1984 at the first Hacker’s Conference, summarizing his discussion between Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and proponents of the free software movement.\n\nMaking the film publicly available is true to Stewart’s philosophy of democratizing new technology and creating access to tools. We also hope it helps grow the Ethereum community, bringing new users into the ecosystem.\n\nLegacy media wants to restrict filmmakers and lock-in viewers into costly monthly subscriptions for mediocre content. NFTs offer an opportunity to liberate filmmakers and audiences from this constraint.\n\nOnce we hit our goal, you’ll be airdropped an animated unlocked 1/1 This Film Wants To Be Free NFT that represents your fractionalized ownership of We Are As Gods (pro rata, based on your percent contribution), as a thank you for freeing this film. We will use Fractional.art to mint a 1/1 animated NFT based on the iconic poster art. We are circumventing the legacy film system, taking a crypto-native approach by distributing the film on the blockchain as a public good—free for everyone to watch, but owned by few.\n\nIf you have any questions for us about rewards, the film, or the campaign, hit us up on twitter @stewartbranddoc\n\nWhen the crowdfund ends, the top three backers are awarded a unique NFT. Take the lead and become a top three backer by contributing.\n\nIf a contribution is placed within the last 15 minutes and changes the podium positions, the time is reset to 15 minutes.\n\nThe Editions are still open until October 10th, but the Patron Podium is now closed. Thank you to everyone who participated. A special thank you to the top 25 patrons. We’ll reach out to you directly about airdropping your unique NFT with bespoke rewards.Big CONGRATULATIONS to the top three winners:\n\nBecome the first backer\n\nWe Are As Gods Movie Poster\n\nStewart is perhaps best known for being editor and publisher of the Whole Earth Catalog, the so-called bible of the counterculture. Years before the Internet would democratize information, Stewart created the ecological do-it-yourself publication The Whole Earth Catalog, which Steve Jobs famously called “Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google existed.” It became a touchstone for an entire generation of hippies, entrepreneurs, hackers, and environmentalists. This aging generative art NFT immortalizes the Whole Earth Catalog.\n\nThis Whole Earth Catalog NFT slowly ages over time so that it looks like the aged artifact of today. Over the next 100 years, this generative art project will reward patience and long term thinking. On a dozen intervaled Earth Days (starting April 22nd 2022) over the next 100 years, The NFT will generate new Whole Earth Catalog cover in your wallet. For the next century, this NFT will continually morph into new and surprising animated versions of the Catalog, capturing the spirit of Stewart’s original publication, and conferring value to the art piece for the next century.\n\nThis is a temporary enveloped token that can be exchanged for the Aging Whole Earth Catalog. This is your ticket to mint—the moment you unwrap, it starts to age.\n\nDigital: NFT-gated directors’ cut of the film, scan of Stewart Brand’s original Whole Earth Catalog, directors’ cut of the Whole Earth 50th reunion. When the film is freed, your name is immortalized in the documentary on a shared title page in the final credits.\n\nAnalog: Your NFT displayed on an Infinite Objects frame, limited edition Blu-ray, \"Why Haven't We Seen a Photograph of the Whole Earth Yet\" button replica, signed film poster.\n\nCost: 5 ETH (the original price of the Catalog was $5.)\n\nToday, Stewart is on a quest to revive endangered and extinct species using a new type of biotech conservation called “genetic rescue” (or de-extinction)—which proposes to resurrect beloved species humans have killed off, such as the woolly mammoth and the passenger pigeon. Stewart says that “computer hacking was about dealing with what we used to communicate and think with. And biohacking has to do with what we used to live with. And it's wonderful that the biotech pioneers are really taking a long-term responsibility for what they're doing.”\n\nThis animated NFT commemorates the future de-extincted woolly mammoth, and Stewart’s mission to bring it back.\n\nDigital: NFT-gated directors’ cut of the film, a scan of Stewart Brand’s original Whole Earth Catalog, and deleted scenes from Stewart's journey to Siberia with geneticist George Church. When the film is freed, your name is immortalized in the documentary on a shared title page in the final credits.\n\nAnalog: Your NFT displayed on an Infinite Objects frame, limited edition Blu-Ray, Whole Earth button replica, and a signed film poster.\n\nThis NFT commemorates the original Whole Earth Catalog ‘68. The scanned art is based on Stewart’s personal copy of the Catalog, and the original NASA footage he used to create it. Interestingly, Stewart only printed 1,000 copies of this first edition. There are only 5 known copies of the original still in physical existence today. Now, you can own 1 of an exclusive 1000 tokens of the blockchain-preserved Whole Earth Catalog 1968.\n\nWeb: Your name will be featured on a special section of the weareasgods.film website as one of the original owners of the world’s only Whole Earth Catalog tokens.\n\nThis NFT is derived from the back cover of the Whole Earth Catalog Epilog (the last official Catalog). The phrase was used as a call-to-action to an entire generation of young Millennials in Steve Jobs’s famous Stanford commencement address in 2005.\n\nWeb: Your name will be featured on weareasgods.film\n\nDigital: Once the film is freed, this still image poster will come alive as a motion NFT. We will airdrop the animated movie poster to all token holders. Use it on our NFT-gated platform to watch a sneak peek of the film, before it becomes publicly available.\n\nAlso, you will be invited to a private Discord chat with exclusive access to the film’s release. You will be the first to know everything.\n\nWeb: You get a special thanks on our website weareasgods.film, for this level and any above.

At the same time, artists and creators should be remunerated for their work, particularly during a time when traditional avenues have been shuttered due to COVID-19. NFTs embody that tension that Stewart grappled with nearly 40 years ago, as Foundation founder Kayvon Tehranian recently wrote.\n\nAlways ahead of his time, Stewart Brand wrestled with the tension that information wants to be free AND expensive decades before NFTs were ever minted on the blockchain. Always with an eye toward the future, Stewart gave the keynote address at Ethereum DevCon in 2018, where he says that the blockchain is the decentralized future of the internet—comparing it to the Whole Earth Catalog \"because the blockchain confers agency—it lets you do damn near anything you want to do.\"\n\nThese NFTs are inspired from the film and Stewart’s life. The drop includes exclusive 1/1 NFTs, rare limited edition NFTs and a rare generative art token of Stewart Brand’s original copy of his watershed publication The Whole Earth Catalog, one of only five known physical copies in existence. Additionally the filmmakers are making unlockable content available that includes a slew of creative downloadable content; private screenings of the film at The Interval in San Francisco; rare physical rewards including copies of the Whole Earth Catalog signed by Stewart Brand himself; and a Directors’ Cut of the film on a limited edition Blu-ray. There are three premium NFTs that will come with a personalised experience with Stewart Brand himself.

app allows kids into virtual strip clubs - BBC News","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60415317","content":"The entrance to a virtual strip club, accessed by the VRChat app\n\nSome apps in the virtual-reality metaverse are \"dangerous by design\", the NSPCC has warned in response to a BBC News investigation.\n\nA researcher posing as a 13-year-old girl witnessed grooming, sexual material, racist insults and a rape threat in the virtual-reality world.\n\nThe children's charity said it was \"shocked and angry\" at the findings.\n\nHead of online child safety policy Andy Burrows added the investigation had found \"a toxic combination of risks\".\n\nThe BBC News researcher - using an app with a minimum age rating of 13 - visited virtual-reality rooms where avatars were simulating sex. She was shown sex toys and condoms, and approached by numerous adult men.\n\nThe metaverse is the name given to games and experiences accessed by people wearing virtual reality headsets. The technology, previously confined to gaming, could be adapted for use in many other areas - from work to play, concerts to cinema trips.\n\nMark Zuckerberg thinks it could be the future of the internet - so much so, he recently rebranded Facebook as Meta, with the company investing billions developing its Oculus Quest headset.\n\nThat headset - now rebranded the Meta Quest - is thought to have as much as 75% of the market share. It was one of these headsets which the BBC News researcher used to explore an app, and part of the metaverse. The app, called VRChat, is an online virtual platform which users can explore with 3D avatars.\n\nWhile it is not made by Facebook, it can be downloaded from an app store on Facebook's Meta Quest headset, with no age verification checks - the only requirement being a Facebook account.\n\nThe BBC News researcher created a fake profile to set up her account - and her real identity was not checked.\n\nInside VRChat, there are rooms where users can meet: some are innocent and everyday - such as a McDonald's restaurant, for example - but there are also pole-dancing and strip clubs.\n\nOne man told our researcher that avatars can \"get naked and do unspeakable things\". Others talked about \"erotic role-play\".\n\nFollowing the BBC News investigation, the NSPCC (National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) said improvements in online safety are a matter of urgency.\n\nMr Burrows, from the NSPCC, told us what we had found was \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"It's children being exposed to entirely inappropriate, really incredibly harmful experiences,\" he said.\n\nHe believes technology companies have learned little from mistakes made with the first generation of social media.\n\n\"This is a product that is dangerous by design, because of oversight and neglect. We are seeing products rolled out without any suggestion that safety has been considered,\" he said.\n\nMeta says it does have tools that allow players to block other users, and is looking to make safety improvements \"as it learns how people interact in these spaces\".\n\nThere are pole dancing clubs and dungeons\n\nBBC News also spoke to a safety campaigner who has spent months investigating VRChat and who now posts his videos on YouTube.\n\nHe has spoken to children who say they were groomed on the platform and forced to take part in virtual sex. He chooses to remain anonymous because he is concerned for the safety of his family.\n\nThe safety campaigner explained because VR is so immersive, children actually have to act out sexual movements.\n\nMy experience in VRChat\n\nBBC researcher Jess Sherwood\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nI was surprised how totally immersed in the spaces you are. I started to feel like a child again. So when grown men were asking why I wasn't in school and encouraging me to engage in VR sex acts, it felt all the more disturbing.\n\nVRChat definitely felt more like an adult's playground than a child's. A lot of the rooms were overtly sexualised in pink neon, similar to what you might see in the red light district in Amsterdam or in the more seedy parts of London's Soho at night. Inside, sex toys were on display.\n\nThe music playing in the rooms, which can be controlled by the players, adds to the impression that it is not a space that is suitable for children.\n\nEverything about the rooms feels unnerving. There are characters simulating sex acts on the floor in big groups, speaking to one another like children play-acting at being adult couples.\n\nIt's very uncomfortable, and your options are to stay and watch, move on to another room where you might see something similar, or join in - which, on many occasions, I was instructed to do.\n\n'Very little moderation'\n\nPeople whose job it is to observe developments in VR are also concerned.\n\nCatherine Allen runs the consultancy Limina Immersive and is currently writing a report about VR for the Institute of Engineering and Technology.\n\nShe says her research team has found many of their experiences in VR \"fun and surreal\", but others have been \"quite traumatic and disturbing\".\n\nShe described one incident in a Meta-owned app where she encountered a seven-year-old girl.\n\nA group of men surrounded them both and joked about raping them. Ms Allen said she had to step between the men and the child to protect her.\n\n\"I shouldn't have had to do that, but that's because there's no moderation, or apparently very little moderation.\"\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nVR and the metaverse are not specifically mentioned in the UK's forthcoming Online Safety Bill , which is due before parliament in the coming months.\n\nBut in evidence to Parliament last year, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries made it clear the legislation would cover the technology.\n\nThe bill, when passed, would impose a duty of care on platforms and providers to protect children from harmful content.\n\nVRChat told us it was \"working hard to make itself a safe and welcoming place for everyone.\" It said \"predatory and toxic behaviour has no place on the platform\".\n\nMeta's product manager for VR integrity Bill Stillwell said in a statement: \"We want everyone using our products to have a good experience and easily find the tools that can help in situations like these, so we can investigate and take action.\"\n\nHe added: \"For cross platform apps…we provide tools that allow players to report and block users.\n\n\"We will continue to make improvements as we learn more about how people interact in these spaces.\"\n\nCharities advise parents to check which apps their children are using on VR Headsets and, where possible, try them out for themselves, to assess whether they're appropriate.\n\nMany apps allow users to simultaneously \"cast\" their experience to a phone or laptop, so a parent can watch what's going on at the same time as their child plays.\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Course: Optimistic \u0026 ZK-Rollups | by Joao Nina Matos | Mar, 2022 | Minthouse","link":"https://blog.minthouse.dev/crash-course-optimistic-zk-rollups-c17bf9cd210c","content":"Crash Course: Optimistic \u0026 ZK- Rollups\n\nRollups confused me for a long time, and now I can finally say with confidence, they confuse me slightly less. As such, I thought I’d share my findings with the world and try give a 5 minute crash course that can hopefully help people who find themselves in the same position I was not so long ago. Ultimately, the goal is to build a base of knowledge which is enough to then go out and read more on the topic without drowning in interminable web3/blockchain jargon.\n\nVI. 🔎 Going Beyond: Further Reading into Zero-Knowledge Proofs\n\nIt’s good idea to establish some basics before diving into what rollups are. Specifically, I’d recommend you familiarise yourself with the following:\n\nRollups were originally introduced as a potential solution to the scaling solution several blockchains face, but namely Ethereum which has reached a scale at which it’s becoming increasingly ill-suited to handle the sheer volume of transactions processed per second, as a result pushing gas fees to astronomical levels.\n\nQuick (extra) side note: The reason this is happening is because Ethereum was built using a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism (as does Bitcoin). This mechanism works for smaller blockchains initially but can only process a relatively low number of transactions per second (because it relies on increasing brute computational power — hence the high energy consumption too). ETH 2.0 is helping solving this by changing to a proof of stake consensus mechanism. This isn’t directly relevant to this article though, because we’re only worried about rollups right now.\n\nTo fix this, there are three potential approaches:\n\nRollups have recently risen as a very promising layer2 technology to scale blockchains. In laymen terms, it’s a technique where several the computations of a transaction actually happen off-chain (externally, off of the main blockchain), and then are rolled up (hence the name) into one simpler transaction that goes onto the main blockchain. More specifically, the rollup contains the updated state of the blockchain after processing the computations off chain, and then submits it to the main chain to update the state (without needing to do all the calculations that were done in the rollup, just updating the state.) The main intention here is to reduce the size of a larger transaction and take the bulk of the computation off chain to avoid paying excessive gas for it. This helps increase transaction throughput (how fast transactions can be processed), and by extension reducing gas fees and creating an opportunity for open participation.\n\nAs is detailed on the official Ethereum documentation , rollups have three key features:\n\n2. Data or proof-of-transactions is on layer 1\n\n3. A rollup smart contract in layer 1 that can enforce correct transaction execution on layer 2 by using the transaction data on layer 1\n\nIn particular, there are two kinds of rollups currently getting a lot of traction: optimistic and zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups — those are the ones I’ll be discussing.\n\nOptimistic rollups, in short, assume the actors who carry out the computations externally are inherently benevolent with no malicious intentions (hence the name).\n\nWhen a rollup is submitted, the transaction is immediately submitted to the main blockchain under the assumption the transaction was correctly carried out. To submit proofs, one must put\n\nIn order to protect against faulty or malicious operations, there are fraud checkers called verifiers .\n\nThese verifiers essentially check that the transaction on layer 2 matches the one on the main (layer 1) chain. If these don’t match, they submit a fraud proof within the ‘dispute period’ — this is the duration for which rollup transactions are considered disputable and fraud proofs can be submitted. When a fraud proof is submitted, the operations in the rollup are replayed onchain (Layer 1) and the resulting state of the chain is compared to what was submitted in the rollup (by the sequencer .) I’ll try illustrate this in a quick example:\n\nLet’s say I run a rollup on my layer 2 node (computer), and submit it to the main chain. When I run my rollup, I create a new state of the ethereum chain, and when it’s submitted to the main chain, the state of the main chain is also updated. Let’s then say my transaction was done improperly, and a verifier submits a fraud proof. In this situation, the main chain enters a dispute resolution mode, during which it reruns the operations in the rollup on the main chain and checks if it’s the same as what I submitted. If it’s not, my transactions are invalidated, and the state of the chain returns to what it was previously. In order to submit this proof, I must put forward a bond (a sum of money) locked in a protocol, and when my transaction is fraudulent / wrong, money is taken from my bond (it’s slashed) and this money is distributed to the verifiers who made sure my faulty transaction didn’t change the whole chain.\n\nThat’s how optimistic rollups work! Do note, this does rely on the assumption there exist verifiers to submit fraud proofs, but this is a generally reliable assumption because as long as there is at least 1 verifier, this system works.\n\nZK-rollups are ‘zero knowledge’ rollups. This is a type of rollup whereby there is no need for a fraud checker, because the rollup incorporates a zero-knowledge proof , made using advanced cryptography \u0026 math, to prove the transaction has been properly done. Essentially when a ZK-rollup is submitted to the main chain, it submits the new state, as well as its proof to demonstrate that it has been correctly done.\n\nYou’ll notice this removes the need for a verifier because we know, using this proof, that all transactions have been done properly (otherwise if an incorrect transaction is sent to the main chain, the proof will be invalid.)\n\nRelated\n\nWe are all bad in someone’s story\n\nI am aware that just by being me, I can not fit in someone’s story.

It seemed foolish to me, not to mention, obnoxious, to profess your love so publicly, so explicitly, and with so much grandiose conviction, so much sentimental melodrama. How can anyone be so sure of anything? How can anyone believe that something as inherently mysterious and elusive as love can become something rigid, unchanging, unequivocal? There was a time when I suspected that everyone was punking me with these vows. And don’t even get me started on the whole “forever” pantomime. How can anything last forever? What makes love the exception? (so why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh).\n\nIn my estimation, marriage was conventional artifice that was once convenient and economical. Now, “marriage is a wretched institution” —\n\nBeautiful romances are transmuted into dull marriages, and eventually the relationship becomes constricting, corrosive, grinding, and destructive. The beautiful love affair becomes a bitter contract.\n\n[…] It is an institution that evolved over centuries to meet some very specific functional needs of a nonindustrial society…Today it is the titillating prelude to domestic tragedy, or, perhaps more frequently, to domestic grotesqueries that are only pathetic. […] The very idea of an irrevocable contract obliging the parties concerned to a lifetime of romantic effort is utterly absurd.\n\nHow many of us would commit to one person in a legally enforceable contract if that wasn’t the norm, established and enforced by our society and all of our systems? We’ve constructed a world made for sets of two, and if you don’t find a life partner by the time you turn 45, you’ll be turned into an animal of your choice. But imagine a world in which staying single, and having three or four or seven great loves is the norm—the rule rather than an exception we only see embodied by chain-smoking, “quirky” Aunt Margot who spends all her money on “eccentric” hats. What would you choose then? When a friend eloped in the same place that Tom and I had been “planning” our ceremony, I quipped, “aren’t we all so unoriginal.” Tiffany responded, “generally speaking, I find partnership extremely unoriginal.”\n\nHow did I get here? It all begins with the beginning: my parents had a euphemistically “tumultuous” marriage that’s mellowed as they’ve settled into their 50s; their prolonged absences left me emotionally muted and savagely independent; quick to tears at the end of a book or the pilot of Glee, the emotions I was capable of feeling lived only in fiction. As an only child for thirteen years, I became accustomed to solitude, by necessity at first, by preference, ultimately.\n\nMy marrow-deep fear of marriage began in high school, while my girl friends were proclaiming that 25 was the ideal age to get married and mood-boarding their future weddings. I remember feeling wistful, wishing that I could be like that too, could feel what they seemed to be feeling. Instead, marriage, to me, marked the end of something precious, something I had and wanted to hold onto: youth, freedom, the freedom that comes with being young, the freedom that comes with uncertainty, ambiguity; and my knee-jerk response to its imagining was dread.\n\nSince then, I’ve stubbornly held onto the belief that I’m not “made for” marriage; when I thought about the faraway horizon of my life, marriage never appeared in my daydreams. (My oldest or closest friends seem to share this belief and aren’t shy about expressing unadulterated surprise that I’ve gotten this far—hi Alice, Allie, Vivienne, and the rest of you.)\n\nIn those quiet years in Tennessee, I unearthed an inner world that not only kept me company through all of the empty moments, but was also, to my later surprise and disappointment, infinitely more fascinating to me than the company of others. In Canada, I found family in friends, but, as would become habit, I always preferred to come home to myself (I believe this is what Dr. Myers and Dr. Briggs diagnose as introversion).\n\nUntil recently, I believed myself to be a drifter, empty-handed and unrooted. As my family moved from China to the U.S., to Canada, back to the U.S., the only thing I had to my name was the inner world that I’d been cultivating since I was 4-years-old, that I’d been nurturing with musty library books and naive attempts at writing. I assumed that being in a relationship necessitated its surrender; in a marriage, its permanent abandonment.\n\nI began by resisting falling in love, including a two-year relationship in which I never said the words, “I love you”; I ended by suspiciously shooing away anyone (read: Tom) who tried to peek inside. You could be welcomed for a time-boxed, invite-only spot of tea, but how dare you show up unannounced. It was mine, and no one else belonged there.\n\nIn the face of Plato’s two-world theory from The Symposium, I believed that there was no worse fate than needing someone to be whole, someone to “complete me.” I refused to predicate my identity on someone else. “Wife” is a permanent label (in theory) that’s defined in relation to another person. Who do I become when I become someone who is defined by another?\n\nThere’s a part of me that feels disgusted at my need to be loved and cared for—because I believed that I had survived so long, so much, without it; because I, by myself, singular and gloriously alone, have always been enough; and because I believed myself to be without needs, especially the need of another; because I believed that needing was a weakness. I was terrified, to be honest, that I would abandon, or at least, compromise, who I am—the only thing that has been true and enduring for me—in the name of love. And that, in marriage, restrained by vows and paperwork, I would never find myself, by myself again.\n\nSomeone once wrote, “at best, marriage is a happy delusion.” At its essence, marriage is an act of optimism. For exactly the reasons public proclamations of eternal love have historically stupefied me, inherent in marriage is a suspension of disbelief, an idealism, and bottomless faith. Despite the 40% divorce rate and the Groundhog’s Day fights or the sterility of never arguing, two people agree to believe in the same god. And, as a recent convert, this is a god worth believing in, worth worshipping, worth fighting for.\n\nLove, you see, is life’s pièce de résistance. You can—and knowing my readership—likely will, do many great things, but I believe that love is the greatest thing you can do. And marriage, is the conviction that love is a magnum opus worth devoting your life to.\n\nSome of us will leave behind our names in history books, or at least on the cover of alumni magazines, or maybe in an issue of Forbes. But, most of us are toiling quietly at ordinary lives. And, all of us are paying attention to the details of our lives, unaware, maybe, that our lives are the accumulation of the smallest details. And who will bear witness to that? I don’t imagine news stations will come running to listen to your account of a Wilson volleyball languishing in the Bay; it’s long become passé to share your breakfast on Twitter, or even on Instagram. And yet, this act of sharing our most frivolous intimacies is fundamental to becoming real; of illuminating ourselves for another, and another for ourselves. As my friend, Izzy, once said to me, “It’s all in the pillow talk, isn’t it?” Holding these details, these intimacies for another; waiting for them, palms outstretched, to pick up where they left off, is a kind of devotion.\n\nMarriage is the routine, the practice, of this devotion. It is the canonicalization of listening to, of noticing, of seeing, of understanding—it is dedicating ourselves to paying attention—day after day after day. It is only through consistency and time, through going through the same small motions, day in and day out, that you can come to knowing, to a kind of mastery. In this practice is the promise that, one day, someone will see you, will know you, will bear witness to you, as your singular self, at your purest—and as you evolve to become different people in different bodies. And that you will do the same for someone profoundly worthy.\n\nIan, a character friend of mine, shared with me a passage from an Ezra Klein/David Brooks interview of Leon Kass :\n\nBut the deepest friendship, he says, is the friendships based upon character, in which you love the person for who he or she is. It’s, in a way, what you said before, in terms of admiration. And you wish that person well for their own sake and enjoy being in their company because it’s uplifting and ennobling and the activities that you engage in with them go deeper into your own soul.\n\nThe best of those friendships — and this, I think, over a lifetime, I’ve come to endorse — the deepest and richest and most permanent friendship, he says, is the friendship not of doing deeds in common, but the friendship of sharing speeches and thoughts, a friendship of seeking understanding, a friendship that is in some way philosophical. There’s no topic’s off limits. And you can spend a lifetime and never get to the end of the conversation.\n\nFor me, Tom is my ultimate character friend. Everything in any relationship—whether it’s singing A Whole New World in the car, or lobster diving in Malibu, or sex on a cliff’s edge, or avoiding eye contact at dinner—is really a conversation. And Tom is the person I can have every conversation with (when I’m willing) and never touch bottom.

Having spent much time on the sets of her parents’ movies, it seemed natural that Dern would one day follow in their footsteps, and she did exactly that when she made her screen debut at the tender age of six, alongside her mother in the action film White Lightning. She has since starred in countless films that include Blue Velvet, Wild, and Jurassic Park, and in 2020 she won an Academy Award for her role in Marriage Story. In 2001, she became a mother herself with the birth of a son; three years later she had a daughter. In 2017, with womanhood on her mind, she wrote the following letter to her teenage girl.\n\nI’ve been thinking a lot lately about what it means to be a woman today. A woman in her own skin, in her power. And as part of that process, I’ve thought back to what I saw when I was your age.\n\nThe '70s were a very new time culturally. The women in my grandmother’s generation were told to choose between just a few life options, but my mother and her friends were part of the revolution in which women made clear that they wanted to do it all. Society began to accept this, but it was assumed that if you try to do it all you’re going to fail at everything.\n\nMy reaction was to decide that even though I could do all things, I was only going to focus on one at a time. Striving not to fail was the burden I put on myself. And I’m writing this to you because I want to make sure that you don’t limit yourself in the same ways.\n\nI spent a lot of my life going, “OK, I’m going to be an actress, but I have to give it everything, so I probably won’t be able to also have a successful relationship,” or “I’m married, so I’m going to put my career on hold and be ‘a good wife’ and support him.”\n\nMost recently, you and I saw a woman running for president, and we were told, “Oh, yeah, she’s brilliant, she’s presidential, but she’s cold, so she’s probably not a good wife and mother. She’s not compassionate.” Why? Because she’s brilliant?! I know that confused both of us. In this strange climate I realised that focusing on one thing in an effort not to fail at anything else was a weight I was carrying. And now I want to be a woman who does it all, no matter how it turns out.\n\nLife is scary, Jaya, and it’s glorious. You’re never going to get it all right. You’ll get it deliciously messed up, and that will be part of figuring out who you are.\n\nThere’s a huge force affecting your generation—it’s called social media, and it’s mothering you as much as I am. This other mother is very influential, and she’s telling you that your value is determined by how many people follow you. She is deciding what beauty looks like and which extravagances add up to a fun life.\n\nWhat social media is giving young girls right now are the two stories that keep us trapped—the black and the white. At one extreme, everything’s perfect and light, and everyone’s surrounded by friends. The other end of the spectrum seems to glamorize the darkest depression and solitude. But I want you to know that most of your life will happen in the gray spaces between bliss and heartbreak, between having everything lock into place and having it all fall apart. That’s where the grace is.\n\nI want you to hear yourself when you’re just barely holding it together. I want you to be able to talk to friends about their gray areas and be open about your own without judgment. You will succeed and fail. Both experiences are worthwhile. They will both define you.\n\nThe beauty of being a woman today is in savoring all the moments that add up to you. You have to get out of your own way and write your own story—and not be forced into the narrative that you think will give you the easiest path to success or the most likes. I want you to live in the space that’s your own, your own delicious mess. The story comes from within you.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

How beautiful it is. The curled splendor of the Monterey Cypresses. The variation of soft, deep, greens that expand outward: through the cracks in the pavement, the empty parking lots, the sprawling open space. The weightless golden light that collapses on the Panhandle in the evenings.\n\nThe dreamer inside of me out-negotiates my internal realist very often. I wrote this in my journal when I got home:\n\nI really do love how being in SF makes you sincerely believe that everything is possible. That the future gleams just beyond reach. It makes me want to strive toward it, throw my whole heart toward it. But I also know that placing too much emphasis on the future makes one neglect the present. I’ve seen the ugly side of it. People who constantly hoard joy for a projected future: a forecasted world where the next thing is the source of satisfaction, success, importance. How some people become obsessed with the metrics, the trajectory. The human impulse to reach a hand into the void for the next thing to grasp onto. But it’s futile because there will always be a next thing, closely followed by the next thing after that. We graduate from one wanting to the next. It’s hard to accept where you are right now when you’re always barreling towards the future, when you place joy in the future tense.\n\nSheila Heti: To find the right distance from everything in life is the most important thing. Like God standing back from the canvas — you can’t see anything when you’re too up close. I realize I’ve been standing so close, nose-to-canvas, my whole life. I often forget to yank myself up to the surface to situate myself, give myself context. All my mind wants to do is think, when what I really need is to feel.\n\nSo I’m setting myself some goals to disconnect from the world more often (aka stop being so goddamn terminally online). I’ve been trying my hardest to stand back. See the bigger picture. Tend to the current moment. Be calmer, less anxious, less neurotic. Learn to love the current me, despite knowing I have so much I want to change, build, do. I recognize all this is much easier said than done lol.\n\nBut I really do wonder. I wonder what it feels like to walk through the long grass, reap in the sweetness — not to build anything or do anything, just to exist and know what that feels like. Lie down and look at the clouds moving in slow motion. I wonder what it feels like to suspend time in this quiet, intimate moment, where I don’t have to think about the next thing at all.\n\nOver the past 2 weeks I re-read Art as Therapy by Alain de Botton (so good!), Pure Color by Sheila Heti, and This is Your Mind on Plants by Michael Pollan\n\n“I won’t be damaged, I won’t be overstretched. I know what really matters and what doesn’t. That too, is love”\n\nUpcoming: The Fruit Thief, one way journey into the interior by Peter Handke, No One is Talking About This by Patricia Lockwood, M Train by Patti Smith\n\nI’ve been obsessed with diving and exploring unique architecture and interior design recently. Sharing Tas Careaga’s 3 year project in renovating an ‘old church in ruins’ and turning it into his dream studio/loft and Alexandre Betak’s parisian home.\n\nMany of you know my dearest (and very talented) friend Justine who I used to write Kopi Club (our old newsletter) with — I deeply miss our co-writing on the couch.

I hope to persuade you that you should start a blog even if you feel that you have nothing to say and even if almost nobody will read it.\n\nI looked over all of my writing and determined that it all originated from one of the following:\n\nMost likely you do at least some of the things I described above. And that means you probably have something to write about.\n\nIt doesn’t matter! Your blog may have the median of 0 visitors per day (as my blog had for the first two years). Your blog may be ungoogleable. Your blog may have no subscribers. But if you’re not embarrassed to tell people “oh, btw I wrote about this / collected some things on the topic on my blog”, the purpose of the blog is fulfilled, since this is the best indicator of your writing actually being helpful.\n\nBut there are a few other reasons to write, the most important of which is that…\n\nIn a parallel universe I became a psychiatrist. In this universe I sometimes offer my friends to listen to their problems like a therapist would have and to maybe give them a few comments. In the last couple of months I did this to two friends and both of them told me almost the same exact thing: while preparing for the conversation with me, they ended up writing a lot of their thoughts and concerns down in a readable, essay-like form for the first time and this very act helped them to understand what is going on much better and to fix a lot of problems even prior our conversation.\n\nThis fact is very frequently lost when discussing writing: writing not only helps you to understand what’s going on and to crystallize your thoughts, it actually makes you think of new ideas and come up with solutions to your problems.\n\nBut this only applies to “essay-like” writing where you pretend to write for someone else and think about narrative and exposition and not just write down a few keyword-bullets for yourself. This is actually why you should not only write blog posts but also have a private journal with coherent text about what’s going on in your life and in your head. I write in my journal anywhere from a few times a week to once every few months.\n\nThe analogy is as follows: you probably had experience learning some math or physics or whatever else where you listen to the lecturer and you understand everything perfectly and then you try to actually solve the problem and you realize that you have no idea how to do it. This is the way thinking and everything else in the world works. You can read all the self-help books in the world. You can read all the blog posts in the world. It’s not enough. Good thinking doesn’t happen by passive osmosis of other people’s good thinking. You have to actually write essays and journals to debug yourself and your ideas. And then, crucially, act ( a ) on this thinking.\n\nConsider a university professor teaching a course. Does she say anything original? Do you think she should cancel her course because somebody else discovered the things she wants to teach? Or does she have to cancel her course simply because there is a similar course at some other university?\n\nOr consider yourself. Do you avoid having conversations with your friends when you think you have nothing original to say? Do you share things with them? Do you give advice? Do you help to understand things?\n\nAs a concrete example, consider my most popular post ever: What Should You Do with Your Life? Directions and Advice . Let’s go through it section by section:\n\nDoes this post contain a single original idea? I don’t think it does. Is it useful? Well, yeah, it is. But this brings me to a more general idea…\n\nBecause it helps in the process of discovery and in the process of supporting underappreciated ideas.\n\nIf you’re still unsure about the value of (un)originality, watch this Tessa Violet video where she explains all of this perfectly. My rephrasing of some of the points she makes:\n\nYou should still watch the video in full - I covered like 20% of it in these bullets.\n\n(Tessa generally has the best . life . lessons )\n\nYour own ideas mostly seem trivial to you because you have the right concept structures in place to support them. You wouldn’t come up with these ideas otherwise. So it’s easier to notice your own ideas in a dialogue: your friend has different concept structures and notices them.\n\nCorollary: don’t be afraid to say obvious things.\n\nCorollary 2: it is ok if it seems to you that you do not have nontrivial ideas of your own. It is just hard to notice them.\n\nAcademics gain prestige by publishing novel stuff. This gives them a warped perspective on what is valuable. You can’t publish a paper that would summarize five other papers and argue that these papers are undervalued in a top journal but in the real world the value of doing that might be very high. The mechanisms of discovery are broken in academia.\n\nYes. It will get slightly easier, though (I’ve been writing quite a lot for the last few years and big posts still require insane amounts of effort). Here are a few tricks to make it easier:\n\nWhy should The Most Dangerous Writing App work? Because it forces you to write at least something ( a ):\n\nProbably the #1 struggle I hear students mention when they talk about writing is the “staring at a blank page” phenomenon. Just try and get something on paper. Even if it’s total stream of consciousness word vomit, that’s still something you can edit and re-organize into an actual paper.\n\nSecondly, it helps to realize that there is zero obligation or expectation to be perfect on the first try. My advisor always said the explicit point of a first draft is to get you to a second draft. I think I was on like, draft #15 or 16 by the time I actually finished my bachelor’s thesis. [emphasis mine; also I rewrote this post 2 times and rewrite most of the posts at least 1-2 times before publishing]\n\nWould you save the post that you wrote to your OneNote /Evernote/whatevernote if you randomly stumbled on it on the internet? If you want your writing to stay with people, you need to first make sure that it would have stayed with you!\n\nThanks to Textor Texxel , Yevhenii Terentiev , and Masha Taktasheva for forcing me to finally write this post.\n\nTo convince a couple of people that they do indeed have a secret that is worth something and to actually do something with it, despite the consensus being that all the low-hanging fruit is already plucked and that working for the giant corporations is the way to go.\n\n“Some people really benefit from hearing advice that everyone knows, for the same reason we keep schools open despite every subject in them having been taught before.\" ( a ) by Patrick McKenzie (this one is especially funny because when I came up with this idea of “but professors still teach completely unoriginal things” from a few sections ago I was 100% sure I invented it independently but no it was just me rephrasing Patrick)\n\nI think it actually goes even much further than memory. With writing, it is fundamentally the process of externalizing an idea which allows you to play with it in ways that I don’t think are so easy when it’s in your head. I’m certainly not capable of it. Writing things down can reduce the amount of ego that you have as you fiddled with an idea. Maybe I’m just crazy, but when I wrote them down and almost pretend like the person who wrote that wasn’t me, it was like, that’s past Devon or someone else entirely. I can detach myself from it much more in a way where, when I am a thinking through something just in my head and lying in bed wondering. I’m not going to be as rigorous about it. Now that’s not strictly worse. There are other things like everyone has great thoughts in the shower for instance. It’s very common. But it doesn’t serve all purposes, especially if you’re trying to vet and find the nooks and crannies of an idea. When you write it down, when an idea has inconsistencies or gaping holes, they are clear and right in the face when it’s written down in a way that is just so easy to gloss over when they’re in your head.\n\nThe Greatest Exercise in Procrastination by Masha Taktasheva:\n\nI thought writing something that you already have in your head is very easy. No, it’s not easy at all. Though you seem to have a structure in your head, you can often see gaps in your argumentation and inconsistency of thoughts once you tell them to another person or write it down on paper. You can believe that you perfectly understand everything in your thoughts and it’s all properly aligned, but this is quite hard to achieve. …\n\nI wanted to say everything. And said nothing. I perceived the text about “something” as a comprehensive list of all thoughts that I had, have and will have about “something”. It sounds silly, but I was stuck with this when I had actually started to put my thoughts in order. But you don’t have to be afraid. In regular conversations, we express a lot of thoughts, which are often incomplete and untidy, but this doesn’t make them any less important. After all, the text is just my thoughts converted into words with some delay.\n\nAt every step and every level there’s an abundance of detail with material consequences.\n\nIt’s tempting to think ‘So what?’ and dismiss these details as incidental or specific to stair carpentry. And they are specific to stair carpentry; that’s what makes them details. But the existence of a surprising number of meaningful details is not specific to stairs. Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality.\n\nYou can see this everywhere if you look. For example, you’ve probably had the experience of doing something for the first time, maybe growing vegetables or using a Haskell package for the first time, and being frustrated by how many annoying snags there were. Then you got more practice and then you told yourself ‘man, it was so simple all along, I don’t know why I had so much trouble’. We run into a fundamental property of the universe and mistake it for a personal failing.\n\nThe best stuff is rewritten over and over again. I know everything I’ve published that has done well has gone through several drafts and incorporates feedback from dozens of other people.\n\nNeither am I. But I am great at taking my first “vomit” draft and spending weeks to make it better and better, over and over again.\n\nThe Ultimate Guide to Writing Online by David Perell:\n\nPopular blogs don’t exist by themselves. Your blog is like an island, and you need to join an archipelago. Finding a community like Ribbonfarm or Less Wrong is one of the fastest ways to spin up an audience. And if you can’t find a community, write for a specific person with a big audience. Whether you write for a community or an individual, if you can attract the gaze of big accounts who promote your work, your audience will grow.\n\nThe problem is that our calibration is bad. The Fear has gone too far, and is keeping too many people quiet too often. Calibration is hard, and calibration of your own skill level is very hard. It speaks well of us that we would rather think of ourselves a level below where we are, than think of ourselves as a level above, but getting it right would be better still. We also are too afraid of trying to go one level too high, and not afraid enough of false humility. I am going to suggest that everyone adjust accordingly.\n\nConsider levels on the following (0-5) online scale: Absent-Lurker-Commenter-Poster/Blogger-Organizer-Leader. You could have a similar offline scale: Absent-Silent-Talker-Presenter-Organizer-Leader.\n\nMy rule of thumb would be: Assume that you are ready to be one level higher than you think you are ready for.\n\nTwelve Rules For Life ( a ) (quoted by Scott Alexander in his review of the book):\n\nThe people I listen to need to talk, because that’s how people think. People need to think…True thinking is complex and demanding. It requires you to be articulate speaker and careful, judicious listener at the same time. It involves conflict. So you have to tolerate conflict. Conflict involves negotiation and compromise. So, you have to learn to give and take and to modify your premises and adjust your thoughts – even your perceptions of the world…Thinking is emotionally painful and physiologically demanding, more so than anything else – exept not thinking. But you have to be very articulate and sophisticated to have all this thinking occur inside your own head. What are you to do, then, if you aren’t very good at thinking, at being two people at one time? That’s easy. You talk. But you need someone to listen. A listening person is your collaborator and your opponent […]\n\nThe fact is important enough to bear repeating: people organize their brains through conversation. If they don’t have anyone to tell their story to, they lose their minds. Like hoarders, they cannot unclutter themselves. The input of the community is required for the integrity of the individual psyche. To put it another way: it takes a village to build a mind. …\n\nA client of mine might say, “I hate my wife”. It’s out there, once said. It’s hanging in the air. It has emerged from the underworld, materialized from chaos, and manifested itself. It is perceptible and concrete and no longer easily ignored. It’s become real. The speaker has even startled himself. He sees the same thing reflected in my eyes. He notes that, and continues on the road to sanity. “Hold it,” he says. “Back up That’s too harsh. Sometimes I hate my wife. I hate her when she won’t tell me what she wants. My mom did that all the time, too. It drove Dad crazy. It drove all of us crazy, to tell you the truth. It even drove Mom crazy! She was a nice person, but she was very resentful. Well, at least my wife isn’t as bad as my mother. Not at all. Wait! I guess my wife is atually pretty good at telling me what she wants, but I get really bothered when she doesn’t, because Mom tortured us all half to death being a martyr. That really affected me. Maybe I overreact now when it happens even a bit. Hey! I’m acting just like Dad did when Mom upset him! That isn’t me. That doesn’t have anthing to do with my wife! I better let her know.” I observe from all this that my client had failed previously to properly distinguish his wife from his mother. And I see that he was possessed, unconsciously, by the spirit of his father. He sees all of that too. Now he is a bit more differentiated, a bit less of an uncarved block, a bit less hidden in the fog. He has sewed up a small tear in the fabric of his culture. He says “That was a good session, Dr. Peterson.” I nod.\n\nSometimes I identify turns of phrase that I’ve picked up from other people. Other times it’s more subtle; a style, a way of looking at the world, a method of reasoning. All of these are just different levels of pattern. My writing style is a slurry of the writing styles of everyone I’ve read and enjoyed, with some pieces chunkier than others. I think my worldview and my reasoning style are too, it’s just less obvious.\n\nWriting is the ultimate test of whether your thoughts make sense or are merely gut feelings. Feelings about why something is the way it is don’t need to be questioned or analyzed in your head because they feel good and you don’t want to rock the boat. Putting thoughts onto paper forces them into an unforgiving reality where you have to look at the words as the same symbols another reader will see them as, unaided by the silent crutch of gut feelings.\n\nGood writers don’t walk around all day with 100,000 words of eloquent wisdom in their heads. No one can do that. They take some vague feeling they’ve been thinking about, dig into a bunch, write down what they’ve discovered, realize half of it doesn’t make sense, delete most of it, write some more, realize the new stuff contradicts itself, panic when they realize they don’t understand the topic as well as they thought they did, talk to other smart people about why that is, learn something new that reminds them of this other thing that might tie into the second paragraph, discover that this thing they believed before they started writing isn’t actually true, realize that if that thing isn’t true then this other thing is probably really important, and so on endlessly. Grinding through this process reveals bits of context that are hopefully new discoveries to the reader. More importantly, they were likely new discoveries to the writer before they set out writing.\n\nThis is certainly the most important thing I’ll ever say in my blogs: YOU should write blogs.\n\nEven if nobody reads them, you should write them. It’s become pretty clear to me that blogging is a source of both innovation and clarity. I have many of my best ideas and insights while blogging. Struggling to express things that you’re thinking or feeling helps you understand them better.\n\nI’ve noticed that people at Amazon have a lot of important things to say, but those things are rarely recorded. If you give a brown-bag presentation, or send a thoughtful email to some internal mailing list, you’ll have an impact, but it won’t be anywhere near the impact you’ll have through blogging.\n\nI’ve talked with a lot of people who are reluctant to write blogs. Everyone offers pretty much the same reasons: they’re too busy, or they’re afraid to put something on “permanent public record”, or they think nobody will read their blog, or they think blogging is narcissistic. Or they’re worried that they either don’t have anything good to say, or they won’t say it very well.\n\nI’m here to tell you that none of these reasons should stop you from writing in your blog. I’ll talk about each of them in turn.\n\nAnd most importantly, when I’m on my death bed 50+ years from now, I will remember writing my novel. I won’t remember 99.9% of my life, or 99% of the people I meet, or 99.9999% of the meals I ate, but I will remember the story I created. It’s a part of me.\n\nMaybe that’s what my bullet point heuristic really is. It’s not just a method of creating memories, but a method of creating myself. The important people I know, the passions I’ve pursued, the things I’ve written are as much a part of me as my personality traits, IQ, physique, or anything else.

Tail End — Wait But Why","link":"https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html","content":"We made a fancy PDF of this post for printing and offline viewing. Buy it here.\n\nWe made a fancy PDF of this post for printing and offline viewing. Buy it here.\n\nIn a post last year , we laid out the human lifespan visually. By years:\n\nWhile working on that post, I also made a days chart, but it seemed a bit much, so I left it out. But fuck it.\n\nThe days chart blows my mind as much as the weeks chart. Each of those dots is only a single Tuesday or Friday or Sunday, but even a lucky person who lives to 90 will have no problem fitting every day in their life on one sheet of paper .\n\nBut since doing the Life in Weeks post, I’ve been thinking about something else.\n\nInstead of measuring your life in units of time, you can measure it in activities or events. To use myself as an example:\n\nI’m 34, so let’s be super optimistic and say I’ll be hanging around drawing stick figures till I’m 90. 1 If so, I have a little under 60 winters left:\n\nAnd maybe around 60 Superbowls left:\n\nThe ocean is freezing and putting my body into it is a bad life experience, so I tend to limit myself to around one ocean swim a year. So as weird as it seems, I might only go in the ocean 60 more times:\n\nNot counting Wait But Why research, I read about five books a year, so even though it feels like I’ll read an endless number of books in the future, I actually have to choose only 300 of all the books out there to read and accept that I’ll sign off for eternity without knowing what goes on in all the rest.\n\nGrowing up in Boston, I went to Red Sox games all the time, but if I never move back there, I’ll probably continue at my current rate of going to a Sox game about once every three years—meaning this little row of 20 represents my remaining Fenway visits:\n\nThere have been eight US presidential elections during my lifetime and about 15 to go. I’ve seen five presidents in office and if that rate continues, I’ll see about nine more.\n\nI probably eat pizza about once a month, so I’ve got about 700 more chances to eat pizza. I have an even brighter future with dumplings. I have Chinese food about twice a month and I tend to make sure six dumplings occurs each time, so I have a fuckton of dumplings to look forward to:\n\nBut these things aren’t what I’ve been thinking about. Most of the things I just mentioned happen with a similar frequency during each year of my life, which spreads them out somewhat evenly through time. If I’m around a third of my way through life, I’m also about a third of my way through experiencing the activity or event.\n\nWhat I’ve been thinking about is a really important part of life that, unlike all of these examples, isn’t spread out evenly through time—something whose [already done / still to come] ratio doesn’t at all align with how far I am through life:\n\nI’ve been thinking about my parents, who are in their mid-60s. During my first 18 years, I spent some time with my parents during at least 90% of my days. But since heading off to college and then later moving out of Boston, I’ve probably seen them an average of only five times a year each, for an average of maybe two days each time. 10 days a year. About 3% of the days I spent with them each year of my childhood.\n\nBeing in their mid-60s, let’s continue to be super optimistic and say I’m one of the incredibly lucky people to have both parents alive into my 60s. That would give us about 30 more years of coexistence. If the ten days a year thing holds, that’s 300 days left to hang with mom and dad. Less time than I spent with them in any one of my 18 childhood years.\n\nWhen you look at that reality, you realize that despite not being at the end of your life, you may very well be nearing the end of your time with some of the most important people in your life. If I lay out the total days I’ll ever spend with each of my parents—assuming I’m as lucky as can be—this becomes starkly clear:\n\nIt turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.\n\nIt’s a similar story with my two sisters. After living in a house with them for 10 and 13 years respectively, I now live across the country from both of them and spend maybe 15 days with each of them a year. Hopefully, that leaves us with about 15% of our total hangout time left.\n\nThe same often goes for old friends. In high school, I sat around playing hearts with the same four guys about five days a week. In four years, we probably racked up 700 group hangouts. Now, scattered around the country with totally different lives and schedules, the five of us are in the same room at the same time probably 10 days each decade. The group is in its final 7%.\n\nSo what do we do with this information?\n\nSetting aside my secret hope that technological advances will let me live to 700, I see three takeaways here:\n\n1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters. I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.\n\n2) Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.\n\n3) Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.\n\nIf you’re into Wait But Why, sign up for the Wait But Why email list and we’ll send you the new posts right when they come out.\n\nIf you’re interested in supporting Wait But Why, here’s our Patreon .\n\nYou can buy a PDF of this post here .\n\nMore things to reflect on:\n\nLife is a Picture, But You Live in a Pixel .

I’m trying to write shorter pieces more frequently. welcome new readers to my little space on the internet (my art, words, and thoughts).\n\nLife is a pretty delicious dream if you know what you want out of it. Brian Eno once said: for the world to be interesting, you have to be manipulating it all the time. This is true. If you know which strings to pull, whose shit to shovel, which rules to break, the world can absolutely be fine-tuned to what you want it to be.\n\nI live by this mantra: you can have everything you want, you just can’t have it all at once – you can have love and desire and youth and wisdom and education and career and puppies and children and indulgence and control. Humans are built to want more than we can handle. To experience pleasure in small amounts and then seek it excessively. Huxley: I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin. I know you want to consume everything, put your greedy little hands on anything you can touch, open your mouth wide, consume it whole. You want to pour something essential of your soul into the world, leave a legacy. You want to run right into the warm, gooey center of love and clasp your arms tightly around it, but external love will not fix you because the love you’re looking for is right there inside of you already. You just have to dig a little deeper.\n\nYou crave everything at once, and see life as one big feast. You want both discipline and freedom, both stability and novelty. But sometimes you need to learn one before the other. You need to see life more as a dance, one that ebbs and flows. Henry Miller: The art of living is based on rhythm. By acceptance of all aspects of life, good and bad, right and wrong, yours and mine, the static, defensive life, which is what most people are cursed with, is converted into a dance, ‘the dance of life,’ metamorphosis. (Acceptance) is the first thing any one has to learn in order to live. It is extremely difficult, because it means surrender, full surrender.\n\nLearn how to wait for things. Accept that you can’t have everything at once. Have patience and a little more self-trust. Surrender yourself to this big, glorious, dream-filled dance we call life. Everything exists on your timeline – you just can’t see it quite yet.\n\nKokoro is well understood in Japanese, but difficult to explain in English, says Yoshikawa Sakiko, director of Kyoto University’s Kokoro Research Center. Conceptually, it unites the notions of heart, mind, and spirit: It sees these three elements as being indivisible from one other. “For example if we say, ‘She has a good kokoro,’ it means heart and spirit and soul and mind all together.”\n\nIn the process of thinking through making a new painting in the style of these ones I made a few years ago, so I went to an acrylic store and picked up some new paints, brushes, and a new stretched canvas. Very excited to paint again. I am going to be painting a new colorful bunny-human.\n\n@sun_girlxo’s newsletter on ‘grief for the living’\n\nI believe this specific instance is when we experience this unique grief for the living—when the contradictions are too overwhelming for us to accept or peacefully incorporate into the image we’ve created of someone, making us feel like we’re stuck\n\nWe experience this grief when something happens that requires a complete reassessment of the person in question; when the only way to understand and accept who they are now is to stop clinging on to our image of who they used to be. Physically, the person is the same—psychologically, they might as well be a stranger.\n\ngrieving someone who is still alive\n\nGrief is a complex emotion to navigate, but there is some comfort in the fact that it is inevitable. We will all one day have to mourn the death of a loved one, and others will do the same for us. But what happens when the person we are mourning is still very much alive—perhaps even still in our lives…\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

People who bring excitement and novelty into my life. Who expose me to new experiences, and ways of seeing the world. Who help me learn, point out my blind spots, and correct me when I am wrong. Who I can lean on when I need support, and who lean on me in turn. Friends who help me grow more into the kind of person I want to be.\n\nI am especially grateful for this, because up until about 4 years ago, I didn’t have any close friends in my life. I had friends, but struggled to form real emotional connections. Moreover, it didn’t even occur to me that I could try to do this. It wasn’t that I knew how to form close friends but was too anxious to try, rather, ‘try to form close friendships’ was a non-standard action , something that never even crossed my mind. And one of my most life-changing experiments was realising that this was something I wanted, and actually trying to intentionally form close friends.\n\nIt’s easy to slip into a passive mindset here, to think of emotional connections as ‘something that take time’ or ‘need to happen naturally’. That to be intentional about things is ‘inauthentic’. I think this mindset is absolutely crazy. My close friendships are one of the most important components of my life happiness. Leaving it up to chance feels like passing up an incredible opportunity. As with all important things in life, this can be optimised - further, if done right, this adds a massive amount to the lives of me and of my future close friends.\n\nThe first half of this post is the story of how I approached intentionally forming close friends, and the second half is an attempt to distill the lessons I learned from this. As such, this post is more autobiographical than most. Feel free to skip to the advice section if you don’t want that. Further, what you value in close friendships is highly personal - this post will focus on what I want in friendships and how I try to get it, but you should adapt this to your own situation, values, and what feels missing in your life!\n\nExercise: Think about your closest friends, and how these friendships happened. What needs are you fulfilling in each other’s lives? Are you happy with this state of affairs, or is something missing? What could be better?\n\nBack when I was in school, I never had close friends. I had friends, people I liked, people I spent time with, whose company I genuinely enjoyed. But I was pretty terrible at being vulnerable and forming emotional connections. These friendships rarely went beyond the surface level. In hindsight, I expect these could have been far richer (and I’ve formed much stronger friendships with some of these friends since!), but I never really tried.\n\nI find it hard to introspect on exactly what the internal experience of past Neel was like, but I think the core was that trying wasn’t available as a possible action. That I spent much of my life doing what felt socially conventional, normal and expected, for the role I saw myself in. And ‘go out of your way to form emotional connections’ wasn’t part of that. It wasn’t an action I considered, weighed up the costs and benefits, and decided against - it never even occurred to me to try. It didn’t feel like a void missing from my life - things just felt normal. It was like playing a video game, and having a list of actions to choose from, like ‘ask about their day’, ‘complain about a shared experience’ or ‘discuss something cool I learned recently’; but this list contained nothing about ‘intentionally form an emotional connection’. It wasn’t in my reference class of things I could do.\n\nOne of the core parts of my life philosophy now is the skill of agency , of actually doing things . The skill of going out of your way to make opportunities. To identify what’s missing in my life, and in the world. Finding the actions that I don’t need to take, that no one else will make me take, or do for me, and deciding to take them anyway. Fixing that which is broken. Finding that which is not broken, and deciding to make it better anyway. Exploring and trying new things. Challenging my self-image and growing. Fundamentally escaping the mindset of needing permission, and breaking past the illusion of doing nothing . I think this is one of the most valuable skills anyone can learn, and one I cherish, though I am far from perfect at it. And this experience is a large part of why I value it. Not realising I could make close friends was a failure of agency , an unknown-unknown that cut out a massive amount of potential happiness, without even realising it.\n\nDespite all this talk of agency, I stumbled my way out of this problem pretty much by accident. When I was 18, in my final year in school, I ended up in a long-term romantic relationship (with a girl who, thankfully, was far better at taking initiative than me!). And this was one of my first times really feeling a deep, emotional connection with someone. And, surprisingly, found that this was great, and added a ton to my life! And further, got a bunch of surface area on what emotional connections actually felt like, and how they formed.\n\nThat relationship ended in my first year of university. And as part of trying to move on and recover, I did a lot of introspection on how the relationship had changed me, and what now felt missing from my life. And one of the biggest things missing was having a deep emotional connection with someone. So I decided to fix this.\n\nThe obvious next question was, what to actually do? In full 19-year-old-Neel fashion, I took a pretty reductionist approach to this. I made a list of all the people I considered close or close-ish friends, and tried to figure out how we became close friends. And in each case, I identified the main shifts in our relationship after intense, 1-1 conversations, where we were both being emotionally vulnerable and authentic, and talking about personal things. So, to make more close friends, all I needed to do was engineer more of these 1-1 conversations!\n\nThis was also inspired by a time when I was 17, and at a rationality camp for high-schoolers . We were doing a workshop on Comfort Zone Expansion (CoZE), where the intention was to identify something we were uncomfortable with but wanted to explore and try in a safe environment. I and another participant noticed we were both uncomfortable with being vulnerable and authentic, and tended to use humour to deflect from anything personal. So, we decided to find a private place and spend two hours having a fully authentic conversation, with no deflection allowed. This was kinda terrifying, but also a really great comfort zone expansion experience, and I felt much closer to him afterwards.\n\nOne decent way of engineering an authentic 1-1 conversation is to go through a bunch of personal and vulnerability-inducing questions together, a la 36 Questions that Lead in Love (after cutting the ⅔ of questions that I found dull). So I made a list of questions I considered interesting, which I expected to lead to authentic and vulnerable conversations. And then went up to the 10-20 people I felt most friendly with, explained the experiment, and asked if they’d be interested in blocking out a few hours, and going through the list together.\n\nSomehow, this worked! About 80% of the people I asked said yes, and I felt much closer with about 50% of them afterwards. Some people were weirded out, but most of my friends were down to try the experiment. With some people the questions felt awkward, but with some people I really vibed. And some people were extremely enthusiastic about the idea from the start - I explained the idea to a guy I vaguely knew, he loved the idea and suggested doing it together, we hit it off immediately, and he’s now probably my closest friend.\n\nIf you’re interested in the questions, you can see the full list here . Some of my favourites:\n\nWhat’s the best way to get to know you as a person?\n\nWhat traits do you envy/value in those around you?\n\nWhat do you feel insecure about?\n\nThis one is higher variance - I don’t recommend leading with it!\n\nWhat do you value in friendships? What are the best ways they add to your life?\n\nHow, historically, have you become close to people?\n\nIf you could design a personal set of social norms for how your friends interact with you, what would they be?\n\nHow would other people describe you? How does this compare to how you want to be perceived?\n\nWhat in life do you get truly excited about?\n\nI am incredibly happy I ran this experiment. It has made my life massively better. And, in hindsight, I am still really surprised that the success rate was so high! If this idea sounds compelling, I would highly recommend people try it - it was an excellent growth experience.\n\nThat said, I still somewhat cringe looking back on that. I think having a literal list of questions made the interactions much more artificial. Since then, my conversational style has evolved to be a lot more natural, while trying to preserve the spirit. I really like asking questions , and will often weave these questions into a conversation if appropriate. And strongly try to create an atmosphere where people are comfortable being honest and vulnerable, and where I show vulnerability in turn.\n\nOne of the main reasons I’d recommend others try this is that it broke me out of a bad equilibria . I was trapped in a ‘normal’ mode of conversation - making small talk, being inoffensive, feeling aversion to being weird, respecting where I thought other people’s boundaries were. But when I tried something totally different and super weird, it often went great! Sometimes other people hate small talk too, and also seek a genuine connection. But by default, this would never have happened - it took one of us taking initiative to break past the trap of social norms. And only by having a bunch of unusual and scary conversations yet having them go great did I develop the courage to be weird. Respecting other people’s actual boundaries is important, but the conventional approach assumes an un-negotiable, one-size-fits-all to boundaries. And empirically, this picture is often totally off - some people think I want them to act normally, but are open to a much wider range of conversational styles if I initiate it.\n\nAnother key lesson is that closeness isn’t just about spending a lot of time being friends - intentional, authentic, 1-1 time together makes a big difference. Sometimes I feel closer to someone after a single amazing conversation, than to people I’ve considered friends for years. Emotional connections aren’t something that just happen to me - they’re something I need to actually try to form. And effort, intelligently applied, can really pay off.\n\nSo, that was my story. Now, I want to try distilling some key lessons that I think might apply to other people’s quests to form close friends.\n\nA key caveat to everything that follows: I argue for being much more intentional about social things than normal. When doing this, it’s easy to come across as cold and calculating. I think it’s super important to try to remain authentic, and to signal authenticity. I find it helpful to generally be friendly, make jokes, be honest and transparent, and be willing to be vulnerable. Eg, being open about the strategies I’m running and why, if it ever comes up.\n\nA key mindset I use when forming connections via conversation is: “If we aren’t both excited about this conversation, do something differently” . This applies especially when talking to someone I don’t know well, and want to figure out whether we might become good friends.\n\nMost social norms optimise for conversations that feel safe, not ones that feel exciting, so I need to do something differently! This means asking the other person questions. This means taking a genuine interest in what we’re talking about - and if I can’t take a genuine interest, then I am doing something wrong.\n\nA tactic I find helpful here is what I call recursive curiosity . I lead by asking an open-ended question that invites a detailed answer. Then, I introspect and try to notice excitement , find the part of their answer I find most interesting, and ask a follow-up open-ended question about it. Then, I repeat this process on their new answer. After about 3-4 iterations, we’ve normally gotten somewhere that feels alive and novel, where we’re both learning, rather than the same stale conversations they have all the time. The follow-up questions don’t need to be thoughtful or elaborate, often just ‘[specific detail] sounds interesting, tell me more’ or ‘[specific detail] didn’t really make sense to me, can you clarify? Did you mean [naive interpretation]?’ are more than enough. Introspecting on confusion or curiosity also works well. Often, rather than having a clear purpose to my questions I try to maximise surface area - just asking questions that point at my confusions and try to maximise the new information I gain, and the amount that I learn. This tends to feel fairly reactive - just responding to whatever was most interesting in the last thing said.\n\nSometimes I feel trapped in a boring conversation direction because the structure of small talk feels hard to break out of. When this happens, I like to go meta, eg observing ‘man, I feel like I keep having the same kinds of conversations at these places’ or ‘let’s get the boring questions out of the way - [standard small talk done rapidly]’. If they seem to empathise, this is a good opener for a more fun question, eg: ’what kind of things do you get excited about?’, ‘what’s something cool you learned recently?’, or ‘have you had any particularly memorable conversations in [this context]?’\n\nI’ve found that practicing this skill has made me much better at forming instant connections when meeting new people, and is much more fun than small talk! Even beyond meeting new people or following concrete algorithms, the spirit of ‘seek the most exciting thread of the conversation’ makes talking to friends way more fun!\n\nWarning: these tactics sometimes get the other person to monologue - I am fine with this, and most people enjoy talking to an engaged audience, but some people feel bad at one-sided conversations. If you apply these techniques, I recommend being willing to monologue in turn if the other person seems interested - otherwise it can feel like you’re being insincere.\n\nFor me, vulnerability, and especially shared vulnerability, are really core to forming emotional connections. But this is difficult to manage because vulnerability, by definition, is hard. Different people have very different boundaries and comfort levels, and respecting boundaries is super important here. But, conversely, successfully creating shared vulnerability is really valuable and worth striving for.\n\nMy main approach is to create a space in which it feels safe to be vulnerable, but try to avoid creating obligations. I try to be honest and vulnerable myself, and freely share things that feel authentic throughout the conversation. I prefer to express lots of small vulnerabilities throughout the conversation rather than sharing something major and making it feel like a big deal - the latter tends to create an obligation/expectation of reciprocation, while the former better establishes a ‘I consider this fine and normal’ norm. I also find that both are effective for breaking people’s social scripts/default ways of acting by being weird and unexpected - I find this is often a good first step to actually having a meaningful conversation. I find that sharing anxieties and insecurities can work particularly well here - almost everyone has them, it feels stigmatised to discuss them but people tend to respect you when you do, and they’re often much more common and relatable than people think. I’ve had a bunch of these conversations, and still find it exciting (and sad) when I meet someone with really similar problems to me!\n\nThe ‘without obligations’ point is particularly important here, and hard to thread - sometimes people would enjoy sharing something vulnerable, but fear that it would make me uncomfortable. I like to ask questions that invite a vulnerable response, but to give the person an ‘out’, some kind of reasonable excuse they could use to deflect without losing face. And by gauging their reactions, and seeing how much further to probe.\n\nOverall, this is pretty hard to gauge and balance. It definitely takes a lot of practice, and I’m far from perfect at it. But I find it very worthwhile to practice.\n\nPersonally, I tend to be very anxious about whether I’m making other people uncomfortable, so I find this technique pretty aversive at times. My main approach to motivation here is internalising that I want to be a person who actually does things - that being vulnerable and welcoming vulnerable are skills I find uncomfortable but value, and I am growing as a person if I cultivate them. And, empirically, I’ve found this really useful to practice. I find this often leads to really awesome interactions, often in my first interaction with someone.\n\nAnother key insight about friendship is that it’s all about upside risk . I will meet many, many more people in my life than I could ever sustain friendships with, let alone close friendships. Thus, if I am meeting new people and want to find potential close friends, I want to filter fast for compatible people. Further, compatibility is heavy-tailed - I won’t really vibe with most people, but some people are awesome. I want to explore and optimise for information. This pushed towards high-variance strategies. If I meet 100 people, and want to pursue a friendship with just a handful, this is great!\n\nThis is a very, very different mindset from standard social norms, which push me towards being bland and inoffensive, and minimising the probability of bad interactions. A bad interaction (so long as it doesn’t damage my reputation) is just as useless as a mediocre interaction for finding potential friends. Instead I want to maximise the probability that, if someone is compatible with me, we have an awesome interaction. This is a key part of why I push for excitement and vulnerability - many people won’t vibe with that, but it makes it much more likely that I hit it off with the right kind of person.\n\nFurther, I am not constrained by the number of people I could meet - there are a lot of interesting people in the world. This means it’s OK (but sad) if some people I could be compatible with don’t vibe with my approach. Some people are pretty closed at first, and take a while to warm up to new people, but are awesome once this happens - my strategies around eg minimising small talk work much less well on this kind of person, which is sad. But the ability to filter fast is crucial. (Note: The trade-off between efficiency and precision depends on your situation, and I expect I’m further towards efficiency than most readers)\n\nAn important part of this is that a good filter is something that identifies people I’m compatible with and convinces them that they’re compatible with me - if it feels like I’m coldly analysing or interviewing them, this is unlikely to go well. This is another part of why I am excited about approaches centred on excitement + vulnerability, those tend to go well if reciprocated.\n\nWarning : This logic does not apply with people who I will need to interact with regularly anyway, eg co-workers/classmates. Social norms around minimising weirdness/potential for bad outcomes make much more sense in those situations, since downside risk is much higher. These mindsets work best when eg meeting people at a party or meetup or friends of friends, where I won’t necessarily interact with them again.\n\nAnother key part of hits-based befriending is meeting lots of people, and exposing myself to lots of possible hits. Some of my favourite approaches:\n\nGoing to events that will attract people with similar interests\n\nTalking to people around me in talks/lectures\n\nAsking my friends for intros to their friends - both generically (‘do you know anyone I might get on with?’) and specifically (‘can you introduce me to [specific person]?’)\n\nProactively reaching out to people who seem interesting\n\nI find this pretty anxiety-inducing, but it has a surprisingly high success rate. Most people are flattered!\n\nHaving public forms on my website for people who want to have a chat or go on a date\n\nExercise: What traits do you value in your friends? What kind of person would you love to be friends with? How could you identify these traits in someone in a first meeting?\n\nSee longer form thoughts on this in Taking Social Initiative\n\nA key second step to the hits-based befriending mindset is to follow-up once I identify someone cool! I try to make sure I get their contact info, and reach out shortly after meeting them trying to arrange a call/meetup. I find that many people are too socially anxious to do this, but this is a really useful skill to practice . The vast majority of my current friendships would not exist if I was bad at reaching out. Most people find this great and flattering, don’t overthink it.\n\nIf you feel convinced of this logic, but still feel anxious about it, my main advice is to practice . Find some safe-ish ways to try it at first, eg with people you really hit it off with, or who seem incredibly friendly, or who you feel really comfortable around. If you’re overthinking it, talk it through with a trusted friend and let them talk you into it. If you’re concerned you won’t know what to talk about, do some research on the person and make an agenda: a list of possible topics or questions to ask them. Initially, it takes a lot of willpower and effort, and may feel super anxiety inducing - this is normal. But after I did it a few times and it went well, my mind started to update, and it now feels like a habit. I find that a similar strategy works for most forms of comfort zone expansion.\n\nAnother tactic for overcoming anxiety is to other-ise . Imagine you met someone at a party, they thought you were cool, and messaged you afterwards asking to meet up again. I don’t know about you, but I’d find that pretty flattering. Or, imagine a specific friend coming to you with an analogous situation, asking whether they should follow-up. What advice would you give to the friend? And, if it differs from your internal thoughts about your situation, why? Personally, I have yet to find a situation where the advice I give to the friend is worse than the advice I give myself.\n\nA related and important skill is keeping in touch. Most people are really bad at keeping in touch, especially without a structure like university that keeps you in frequent contact. This means that many friendships fizzle without this structure. And this is really sad! I find a common mindset is ‘if friend X really valued this friendship, I wouldn’t be the one to always reach out’. But, empirically, I am confident many of my friends value our friendship, but also suck at reaching out. Being conscientious and organised is just hard, and varies a lot between people. Some people are very organised and keep in touch with everyone with ease, others easily lose track of close friends. ‘Does this friend reach out to me?’ is an incredibly noisy signal for how much they like you, and I consider it to convey approximately no information. I want to be good at keeping in touch, because I want to be able to remain friends with less conscientious people. And if I want to know if a friend actually likes me, there are much more direct ways of asking them.\n\nBut, fundamentally, keeping in touch should not be that hard - you just need to regularly reach out to arrange a call/meetup. This can be solved by being highly conscientious and having a good memory, but if you’re lazy like me, the correct way to solve this is with systems . I have a pretty barebones spreadsheet ( see template ) that lets me set an interval of N days to reach out to each friend, and reminds me to reach out N days after our last call, which has completely solved this problem. Other systems, such as Calendly , are great for streamlining both following-up and keeping in touch, by making it trivial to schedule things.\n\nFor me, much of the anxiety around following-up and keeping in touch centre on being a burden, and bothering other people. A mindset I find helpful is reframing it all as providing a public good . Taking social initiative is hard and most people aren’t very good at it. But most people do value fun social interactions. And, for some reason, people often enjoy interacting with me. This means that by taking social initiative, I am creating more opportunities for both of our lives to be better, which is something I find deeply motivating. ‘I want to be a person who creates win-win situations’ is fairly core to my identity. Whether it’s following-up, keeping in touch, organising parties, suggesting group activities, etc, I want there to be more people in the world who do this. So I want to cultivate this skill myself.\n\nSee my post on Friendships for a deeper dive into what my ideal friendship looks like\n\nMy guess is that a surprising amount of the variance in friendship quality comes from finding the right people, and that things can often flow easily from there. But I think that it is also clearly valuable to practice the skill of deepening existing friendships. I have less time actively optimising this skill, and feedback loops are harder, but here are some thoughts:\n\nAll my thoughts so far on vulnerability, excitement and authenticity also work for deepening friendships - I find that having regular authentic and meaningful conversations really help me feel closer to people\n\nIn particular, searching for unusually fun/fulfilling ways to spend time together. Pay attention to their interests, experiment, and take social initiative!\n\nRelatedly, actually make time to spend together. Protect your Slack , and spend it on the people you care about. It’s easy to make the mistake of considering social stuff the low priority thing to cut when I’m busy.\n\nDon’t feel constrained by fear of seeming weird, or social norms\n\nSome social norms are good, some are bad. But if I really care about someone, I want our relationship to be optimised for their preferences. And this means figuring out what they want, and setting explicit boundaries and norms with each other\n\nEg, do they value honesty? Politeness? Bluntness? Proactivity? Compliments? Affection?\n\nRelatedly, have good and clear communication about what we both want out of the friendship, and how the other person adds to our life\n\nPeople often find this hard - it’s hard to eg communicate about ways the other person annoys you without harming them. For me, a key is creating clear and explicit common knowledge that we both value this friendship and are invested in it. This frames all clear communication as being on the same team - we’re trying to work together and share information, so we can both forge a better friendship\n\nSeek positive externalities - be a pleasant person to be around, and find ways to add joy to the lives of those around you\n\nTry to form a coherent model of how they add value to my life and vice versa. Once identified, try to actively optimise for the ways I add value.\n\nObvious caveats : Make sure to remain authentic, account for uncertainty in the model, check for consent, etc\n\nLove languages - different people have very different ways of expressing affection, and it’s easy to typical mind fallacy . Some people really value appreciation, others value your time, others value gifts, others value physical affection, etc. I find it hard to empathise with people with different love languages, so it’s important to explicitly notice and account for this, and understand what my friends want\n\nEmotional support/debugging - one of the most valuable parts friends play in my life is providing emotional support, and help solving my problems. And I want to be able to provide this in turn. But this is really hard, and definitely a practicable skill!\n\nMy main tip is to avoid jumping to conclusions about the problem and what is needed, and instead to explore the problem more than feels necessary. I often explicitly ask ‘what kind of help are you looking for?’ - sometimes they want a solution, sometimes they just want to vent\n\nSee this post for more advice\n\nBut remember, these are just my takes, according to my friends and my values. You should experiment, try things, and figure out what works best for you!\n\nExercise: Make a list of your good friends. Which of them do you feel closest to, and what has led to this? What blocks are there to being closer to some, and what are you going to do about it?\n\nClose friends are very important to my life. And solving the problem of intentionally making close friends has added a ton of value, helped me make many friendships I cherish. Further, I’ve managed to add a lot of value to their lives. Friendship is one of the best mutually beneficial trades I’ve ever made.\n\nThe ideas in this post are all specialised to my tastes, and my experiences. I am a massive fan of 1-1 conversations, and of shared vulnerability. But your mileage may vary! You should experiment, try things, and forge your own vision of what intentionally forming close friendships looks like for you.\n\nA point I’ve made throughout is that this is a skill . These are all things you can practice, experiment, iterate and get better at. It’s easy to think of friendships as just something that happens to you. But I assert that, for most people, the cap on how awesome their friendships can be is far higher than where they are right now - it would be weird if that wasn’t the case! Relationships are complex.\n\nFinally, my key lesson from all this is that I need to take agency . It’s easy to go through life never solving this problem, never even noticing the lack. Nothing will go visibly wrong. Nobody will stop you, or solve this for you. If you need permission from someone to do something differently, let this post be it - if you want your social life to be better, the only one who will fix this is you.\n\nIf the ideas in this post have resonated, I encourage you to take a moment to stop and reflect on your social life: Are you happy with how things are going? Do you feel happy with your ability to emotionally connect? Could it be better, and if so, how? What have you tried to do about this so far? And looking forwards, what are you going to do about this?\n\nExercise: Set a 5 minute timer, and list as many concrete ideas as you can for experiments to run, and things to try doing differently.\n\nBonus exercise: Actually do something about it

From social science research methods, to scientific styles of inquiry, to engineering-based models for problem-solving, designers can choose from a variety of ways to tackle any design challenge.\n\nOne approach that has gained momentum in recent years is speculative design. Popularized by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby in their book Speculative Everything , the speculative design movement sparked an interest in critical and imaginative methods for design. The introduction of Speculative Everything in 2013 coincided with a burst of new consumer technologies and the rapid integration of new products and services into our daily lives.\n\nWhen a product or service enters into our daily life, it becomes a part of our reality. The simple act of buying, in part, has direct implications on our future.\n\nWith so many possibilities for new consumer technologies, we as designers need to continually ask, Is this the reality we want? How might we shape our future through the products and services we create?\n\nSpeculative design provides a framework for asking these critical questions. It allows designers to imagine what the future might look like if different solutions were adopted. It provides designers with the tools to speculate upon social, ethical, and political implications of new technologies.\n\nIn a typical design setting, designers create products and services that are sold to consumers. In a speculative design setting, designers create artifacts and prototypes meant to provoke thought and reflection. Speculative design operates on a more conceptual and philosophical level, by inviting us to question how new technologies might alter our everyday lives, and how they might impact our futures.\n\nThe core question asked within speculative design is, “What if…?”\n\nWith speculative design, we start by asking, Is this a good idea? Before asking, How do we make it happen?\n\nWith speculative design, we start by asking, Is this a good idea? Before asking, How do we make it happen?\n\nSpeculative design aims to provoke thought about our current world, and our possible futures, through the lense of technology.\n\nAn example of speculative design can be found in the automotive industry. During annual auto shows and media events throughout the year, car companies showcase a variety of new concept vehicles. Though they’re typically never planned for production, concept vehicles invite the public to speculate upon a future in which the vehicle exists as a part of everyday life.\n\nIn their book, Dunne \u0026 Raby believe that auto shows can take the speculative element further by demonstrating how different concept vehicles could impact the way people move in a future ecosystem.\n\nWith speculative design, we start by asking, Is this a good idea? Before asking, How do we make it happen?\n\nThe future is full of possibilities\n\nThe future is full of possibilities\n\nFutures are central to speculative design. Within this context, the future is seen as a range of possibilities. Futures can be characterized as probable, plausible, possible, and impossible, depending on the likelihood of it occurring.\n\nA time horizon of ten years (the near future) is considered ideal for speculative design. According to Phil Balagtas, founder of the Design Futures Initiative , if we project too far into the future, we’re more likely to end up with mere speculation. At the other end of the spectrum, if we stay too close to the present, our predictions would have to be thoroughly and critically researched. Speculative design, therefore, exists somewhere in between.\n\nIt also allows us to identify wild card scenarios, or low-probability, high impact events, that can jolt society in a major way.\n\nBased on this model, the future is something that we shape and build through the choices we make today.\n\nDespite its theoretical nature, speculative design relies on thorough research and analysis. In order to avoid pure speculation, plausible scenarios must be built upon a strong body of well-researched evidence. This can be developed by following evidence-based trends over time, or by examining how certain events have played out in history.\n\nSuperflux is a London-based design agency which specializes in futures-oriented design. In their various projects, the agency creates scenarios by extensively scanning for trends and signals, while relying on historical and contemporary datasets to derive evidence-based scenarios for the future. Some of their work aids government officials in determining policy changes for the future.\n\nDesigners today come from a variety of disciplines, ranging from art and architecture, to computer science and biotechnology, to psychology and anthropology.\n\nWith the proliferation of consumer technologies, design in recent years has turned to engineering-based models and social science protocols for problem solving and for studying how people interact with technology.\n\nBreaking away from this trend, speculative design looks toward literature and contemporary art for inspiration. From literature, it borrows techniques for crafting fictional narrative, as well as literary devices for keeping readers immersed in a make-believe world. Like literature, speculative design is also a way to explore human nature, constrained only by what’s possible through language.\n\nOne genre that closely mirrors speculative design is speculative fiction. A key figure in this genre is Booker prize winner Margaret Atwood, author of many books, including The Handmaid’s Tale. In an interview to The Guardian , Atwood distinguishes speculative fiction from science fiction by noting that it is based on events that “could really happen,” drawing it away from the fantastical and towards the realm of the possible.\n\nSpeculative design also borrows practices from contemporary art, such as the use of objects for social commentary, rather than for commercial or functional purposes. Speculative designers may also use museums and galleries as spaces to display their work for public consumption.\n\nOne interesting example of speculative design is Facestate , a project by Amsterdam-based artist collective Metahaven. This work speculated upon the possibility of a social network becoming an independent state. The artists created objects that represented the type of government, currency, and surveillance system such an entity might have. According to Metahaven’s Vinca Kruk and Daniel van der Velden, these objects were meant to be “more of a prototype, a sketch, than a finished product,” in contrast to the polished commissioned pieces which we often see in galleries and museums.\n\nBuilding upon an evidence-based foundation, speculative design adopts techniques from literature and art, placing an emphasis on the use of criticism and fictional narrative.\n\nFinally, speculative design also draws from a range of specialized disciplines, including critical design, design fiction, design futurism, and strategic foresight.\n\nBelow are some tools and frameworks to provide a sense of what speculative design practices might look like. A number of these are borrowed from strategic foresight frameworks, and can be used on their own, or combined with other design approaches:\n\nScenarios are stories about what the world might be like tomorrow. Scenario building involves following trends across time, and recognizing how key technological, social, and political forces might impact the future. Some scenarios can seem far fetched, but they are important reminders that we can overlook possibilities, simply because they seem implausible to us now.\n\nScenario building starts with a focal point, such as how biometric tracking might be used to monitor health. We can map out known trends, such as age demographics in the next ten years. Then we can consider possible unknown forces, such as government regulations, public opinion, or potential misuses of biometric data.\n\nQuestions to ask are: What are the most important technological, social, and political forces to consider? How certain are we about each of these forces?\n\nAs a key feature of speculative design, scenarios can be illustrated through writing, storyboarding, film, or a number of different ways.\n\nBy developing complex, detailed scenarios about what might lie ahead, these exercises serve to inspire thought about the hopes and fears surrounding different technological futures. They also allow us to explore alternatives that don’t necessarily sit comfortably with our current understanding of the world.\n\nBackcasting is a framework that involves working backwards from a chosen scenario. A scenario is chosen to illustrate a precise and detailed situation from the future, and backcasting provides a framework for working backwards in time, breaking down the steps needed to achieve the prospective goal. Key events, or milestones, are identified to illustrate a path toward this future.\n\nFor example, backcasting can be used to establish milestones for working towards a future in which certain sustainability criteria is met for electric vehicles. Working backwards enables us to determine how technologies and policies need to fall in place for the desired future to come to fruition.\n\nThis exercise allows designers to think about how the products in question can shape our life and society, instead of focusing merely on the product and the technology behind it.\n\nThis exercise allows designers to think about how the products in question can shape our life and society, instead of focusing merely on the product and the technology behind it.\n\nArtifacts from the future can be imagined as items that an archeologist traveling ten years into the future would bring back, as an illustration of what daily life would look like then. These artifacts serve as tangible conversation starters, in order to make scenarios more concrete. Tangible prototypes also serve as great starting points for critical discussion.\n\nFor example, this might be a news feed from the year 2030, a face mask worn in futuristic New York, or an object from a remote workplace of the future.\n\nArtifacts from the future are objects that provoke thought and dialogue and, according to Dunne \u0026 Raby, may knowingly include contradictions and cognitive glitches to make us think twice about its purpose and impact in the world.\n\nAlthough these prototypes are not meant to be preliminary versions of a commercial product, they can nonetheless help designers gather information about what and how to design products and services that can bring us closer to our envisioned goal for the future.\n\nThe futures wheel framework is an exercise for exploring the direct and indirect implications of a new product, service, or technology. By placing the object of inquiry in the center, designers can map out the first- and second-order consequences of introducing a new product into the world.\n\nWith engineered (or “clean”) meat, for example, a direct implication may be the availability of greater supermarket options or new restaurant menu items. An indirect implication could be the preservation of rainforests normally cleared for livestock grazing, with further implications being a deceleration of climate change due to large-scale efforts in producing meat substitutes.\n\nThis exercise allows designers to think about how the products in question can shape our life and society, instead of focusing merely on the product and the technology behind it.\n\nNarrative can be used as a design tool to articulate scenarios in a rich and compelling way. It helps us illustrate a point of view, in a way that logical arguments fail to do.\n\nSpeculative design also employs fictional narrative in order to craft future scenarios, weaving together fact and imagination. Narrative within speculative design can bring in elements of humor, satire, or subtle forms of absurdity for emphasis.\n\nThe use of narrative also allows for unconventional framings, such as viewing a futuristic city from the perspective of an autonomous vehicle. In the film Where the City Can’t See , speculative architect Liam Young crafts a narrative entirely from the perspective of a driverless car, through the lens of laser scanning technology. The film follows a group of factory workers in search of a spot in the city that exists but doesn’t show up on a map, wearing clothes that camouflages them from machine vision technology.\n\nOne famous example of narrative used for exploring technological futures is the Netflix series Black Mirror, which eerily speculates upon the implications of new technologies embedded into daily life.\n\nWithout the emphasis on creating commercially-viable products, speculative design can seem like a futile exercise, producing outputs that are not immediately actionable.\n\nNonetheless, speculative design has the potential to enrich product and services development, especially when companies like Visa, Ford, Pepsi, Samsung, and NATO have hired science-fiction writers to craft visions and speculations for the future.\n\nFor whom? By whom?\n\nAn important question to raise in any design practice is, For whom? By whom? It’s crucial that designers are not placed at the center of the process, assuming a single reality, when there could be seven billion possible ones.\n\nDesigners can mitigate this bias by bringing in different perspectives throughout the design process, while playing more of a facilitator role. Understanding who the audience is, is crucial for framing outputs in an impactful and accessible way.\n\nWhile a healthy balance of optimism and pessimism may be important for speculative design practices, the discipline can veer dystopian at times.\n\nExposure to too many dark and estranged scenarios may be paralyzing, and lead to a passive and fearful view of the future. Speculative design is not meant to be a disheartening practice, rather to encourage designers to be proactive about shaping the future.\n\nDesign can be a useful tool for provoking thought and discussion around what we’d like to happen in years to come, and shaping, instead of reacting to, what’s ahead.\n\nWhile it’s important to design products and services to meet today’s needs, it’s also important to explore the social, ethical, and political implications of the new products and services we produce. Speculative design helps us realize that there isn’t just one way, but many ways to go forth into the future, through the roles that we play in helping it to take shape.","tokenFrequency":{"aim":1,"import":6,"determin":2,"book":3,"turn":1,"polish":1,"lowprob":1,"within":3,"help":4,"hope":1,"fantast":1,"base":2,"happen":4,"jolt":1,"everyday":2,"thorough":2,"break":2,"direct":3,"receiv":1,"built":1,"behind":3,"machin":1,"unknown":1,"graze":1,"deliv":1,"interview":1,"world":6,"despit":1,"examin":1,"entir":1,"scan":2,"upon":6,"lie":1,"introduct":1,"age":1,"evid":1,"plausibl":2,"balanc":1,"access":1,"profession":1,"constrain":1,"adopt":2,"balagta":1,"prospect":1,"think":4,"toward":4,"handmaid":1,"style":1,"met":1,"starter":1,"sold":1,"automot":1,"depend":1,"writer":1,"immedi":1,"devic":1,"technolog":20,"remot":1,"label":1,"→":1,"full":2,"clear":1,"network":1,"enter":1,"well":1,"assum":1,"ten":3,"step":1,"comfort":1,"instead":4,"role":2,"focus":3,"imposs":1,"sens":1,"overlook":1,"inspir":3,"like":9,"eerili":1,"data":1,"ford":1,"solv":1,"humor":1,"craft":4,"ahead":2,"serv":3,"establish":1,"welcom":1,"process":2,"good":3,"dishearten":1,"reader":1,"core":1,"version":1,"near":1,"social":8,"also":10,"especi":1,"repres":1,"popular":1,"it":3,"need":4,"scientif":1,"nato":1,"livestock":1,"realiz":1,"commerciallyvi":1,"place":4,"differ":5,"includ":3,"wheel":1,"contradict":1,"react":1,"fear":2,"rabi":3,"detail":2,"dystopian":1,"bodi":1,"everyth":2,"provid":4,"commiss":1,"integr":1,"invit":2,"explor":5,"wild":1,"wixcom":1,"practic":5,"protocol":1,"special":2,"exposur":1,"meant":4,"form":1,"back":1,"stay":1,"climat":1,"plan":1,"possibl":12,"idea":3,"futurist":2,"challeng":1,"probabl":1,"©":1,"deriv":1,"literatur":4,"tool":4,"ideal":1,"art":4,"vision":2,"pepsi":1,"part":5,"visa":1,"ask":10,"20062022":1,"first":1,"argument":1,"trend":5,"impact":6,"fail":1,"mitig":1,"move":1,"critic":6,"embed":1,"futuresori":1,"embrac":1,"context":1,"backcast":3,"perspect":3,"certain":3,"high":1,"view":4,"write":1,"psycholog":1,"come":3,"likelihood":1,"element":2,"analysi":1,"tomorrow":1,"advanc":1,"continu":1,"servic":9,"product”":1,"latest":1,"fiction":7,"human":1,"worn":1,"fiona":1,"problemsolv":1,"avoid":1,"introduc":1,"contrast":1,"agre":1,"kruk":1,"tale":1,"media":1,"optim":1,"aid":1,"tackl":1,"privaci":1,"superflux":1,"platform":1,"purpos":2,"one":6,"type":1,"act":1,"prototyp":4,"next":2,"spectrum":1,"chang":2,"must":1,"happen”":1,"avail":1,"creat":10,"know":1,"pure":1,"coincid":1,"":72,"effort":1,"techniqu":2,"supermarket":1,"state":1,"film":3,"glitch":1,"anthropolog":1,"various":1,"typic":2,"method":2,"project":4,"vehicl":6,"sketch":1,"achiev":1,"momentum":1,"spot":1,"face":1,"predict":1,"number":2,"navig":1,"forc":4,"satir":1,"design":71,"meet":1,"ethic":2,"could":3,"bias":1,"engineeringbas":2,"they'r":1,"togeth":1,"samsung":1,"play":3,"gain":1,"don't":1,"commerci":2,"currenc":1,"due":1,"movement":1,"vinca":1,"varieti":4,"card":1,"paralyz":1,"distinguish":1,"precis":1,"item":3,"illustr":5,"new":13,"approach":3,"mileston":2,"opinion":1,"develop":3,"see":2,"wear":1,"never":1,"conceptu":1,"menu":2,"booker":1,"desir":1,"would":3,"billion":1,"nonetheless":2,"lens":1,"start":5,"independ":1,"substitut":1,"forth":1,"thought":5,"chosen":2,"option":1,"inquiri":2,"ltd":1,"alter":1,"simpli":1,"2030":1,"netflix":1,"pessim":1,"framework":6,"metahaven":2,"deceler":1,"scenario":16,"architectur":1,"travel":1,"dunn":3,"us":9,"extens":1,"compel":1,"annual":1,"cognit":1,"seven":1,"encourag":1,"found":1,"compani":2,"specul":47,"rang":3,"proactiv":1,"der":1,"signal":1,"final":1,"map":3,"cloth":1,"author":1,"keep":1,"entiti":1,"concept":3,"key":4,"envis":1,"bring":4,"exercis":6,"atwood":2,"york":1,"involv":2,"driverless":1,"draw":2,"rainforest":1,"current":2,"situat":1,"look":5,"across":1,"offici":1,"far":2,"weav":1,"track":1,"winner":1,"follow":3,"complex":1,"realm":1,"initi":1,"recogn":1,"way":11,"museum":2,"fact":1,"exampl":6,"search":1,"somewher":1,"mirror":2,"major":1,"close":2,"frame":2,"concret":1,"criteria":1,"take":3,"simpl":1,"question":9,"identifi":2,"known":1,"preserv":1,"passiv":1,"reli":2,"altern":1,"news":1,"throughout":2,"live":2,"fetch":1,"rapid":1,"daniel":1,"potenti":2,"burst":1,"founder":1,"piec":1,"employ":1,"work":7,"solut":1,"horizon":1,"implic":8,"editor":5,"lead":1,"facest":1,"galleri":2,"velden":1,"consumpt":1,"output":2,"rich":1,"electr":1,"evidencebas":3,"narrat":8,"understand":2,"becom":2,"realiti":3,"often":1,"feed":1,"van":1,"research":3,"system":1,"showcas":1,"theoret":1,"problem":1,"character":1,"industri":1,"crucial":2,"histor":1,"spark":1,"unforese":1,"produc":3,"engin":1,"artifact":4,"central":1,"architect":1,"use":11,"peopl":2,"hire":1,"without":1,"health":1,"point":3,"though":1,"natur":2,"great":1,"backward":3,"oper":1,"level":1,"choic":1,"genr":2,"black":1,"path":1,"emphasi":3,"futur":39,"healthi":1,"auto":2,"2013":1,"facilit":1,"archeologist":1,"convers":1,"page":1,"web":1,"monitor":1,"agenc":2,"strateg":2,"note":1,"audienc":1,"stori":3,"makebeliev":1,"fall":1,"philosoph":1,"ecosystem":1,"end":2,"polici":3,"absurd":1,"isn't":1,"might":11,"ve":1,"group":1,"thoughtprovok":1,"build

- Brian Timar","link":"https://www.briantimar.com/notes/mimetic/mimetic","content":"Mimetic traps\n\nI’ve been a graduate student in physics for almost three years, but I only recently figured out why. I had to tackle a simple question do so:\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nI realized that I’d never forced myself to answer this honestly. As Paul Graham has pointed out , these systematic gaps in conversation should raise suspicion — they often indicate when you’re wrong about something important. I was wrong in thinking that my work mattered to me, and I avoided asking myself this question because I knew the answer would be painful.\n\nOne afternoon, while moving out of an apartment, I came across a cardboard box packed with binders and paper folders, full of notes accumulated over the past year. As I let it fall in front of the door, a thought dropped into my head and stuck there: none of this means anything to me. This was, nominally, the fruit borne of a year of my life, and it felt so viscerally wasted. Despair bought me honesty — by enrolling in graduate school, I’d made myself miserable for no reason. Why had I spent so much time in purposeless hard work? I arrived at a simple mechanism: an excessive sensitivity to the desires of others, and a competitive environment.\n\nI ended up in physics through stubbornness, and an unusual willingness to suffer for the sake of grades. As an undergraduate, I was not particularly passionate about quarks, quasars, or quantum mechanics, but I was academically very competitive, and once I’d settled on physics as my major I determined to place myself at the top of my class. I did so by throwing myself into the hardest classes and putting in the hours required to ace the tests. This was, to put it mildly, a bad idea. I got a sort of grim pleasure from vanquishing my classmates in these academic slogs, but I was basically miserable. So why’d I keep it up?\n\nWhen multiple people are striving towards a shared goal, they often rank themselves by progress within their peer group. This was my mistake — I swapped an absolute goal (figuring out how bits of nature work) with a relative one (scoring higher on tests than my classmates). Later, when I found myself unhappy, I couldn’t leave without feeling like I’d lost something. That social capital sunk cost was the first part of the trap I found myself in.\n\nThe second was a positive feedback loop that encouraged me to spend ever-increasing amounts of time on my work. Humans inherit convictions mimetically from each other — we learn what to value by imitating our peers. As my desire to excel academically grew, I spent greater amounts of time in and around the physics department. The more time I spent there, the greater my desire to excel. I’d never given physics much thought at all before my senior year in high school — but once I was surrounded by other physics students, competing for the same pool of grades and research positions, I could think of little else. This inherited desire was unchecked because I had no life outside of academics — no fixed reference point. Although quitting would have made me happier, I felt like I had nowhere to quit to. My tunnel vision left me with few concrete notions of alternative pursuits, and without a destination, I could not seriously contemplate leaving. Plans are never plausible until they contain specifics, and implausible plans tend to be discarded. Many of my peers in physics only added incredulity, consciously or otherwise. The result was a reality distortion field — quitting was not just painful, but unimaginable, unthinkable. I ended up in graduate school not because I wanted to toe the bleeding edge of natural science, but because I simply couldn’t imagine doing anything else.\n\nThat’s the mimetic trap in a nutshell: it hurts to leave, and there’s nowhere to go. It decouples the social reward signal from the rest of objective reality — you can spend years ascending ranks in a hierarchy without producing anything that the rest of humanity finds valuable. If you value the process itself, that’s fine. I didn’t. Cowardice kept me from acting on this, and after a while I came to believe I had to succeed in this field I’d fallen into essentially by chance.\n\nI suspect I’m not the only one who’s felt this trapping effect in physics. Some theorists seem to work primarily on fad topics inherited from other prominent departments (ever heard of dynamical quantum phase transitions?). That’s not to say these research areas aren’t valuable, beautiful, or profound — but I’m wary of the process that pulls people into them. Among experimentalists, it’s not hard to find graduate students who can tell you every detail about how a particular machine operates, and almost nothing about why it should be built. Again, if they’re enjoying the process, more power to them. My point is that they’re driven in part by mimetic forces, and for people with a certain psychological weakness, this can lead to purposeless toil. I know what this feels like, and it terrifies me.\n\nPhysics is hardly a lone offender within academia. Graduate programs select for intensely competitive individuals with highly specific skills, often with negligible market value outside of universities. A strong desire for publications on esoteric topics is inherited from senior postdocs and professors, making tunnel vision especially acute. The activation energy required for quitting is famously high, in part because the glow from the genuine intellectual lights in any field make outside jobs seem (unfairly) pale and shallow in comparison. The number of academic positions in any sub-field is typically small and static, leading to zero-sum competition for titles. This is the worst sort of posturing, and harms the psyche — as Eric Weinstein puts it ,\n\n…it’s better to be in an expanding world and not quite in exactly the right field, than to be in a contracting world where people’s worst behavior comes out and your mind is grooved in defensive and rent-seeking types of ways.\n\nAcademics have uniformly rather low salaries, increasing our tendency to focus on social status as a measure of success. Salary gradations are useful for disrupting mimetic effects because they tie effort expended directly to units of universal economic value — convertible to kilos of rice, oil, and stuff in the physical world. A price is a lifeline to reality: all else being equal, the job with the lower wage is probably less valuable. Without this signal, the goals of a peer group are easily decoupled from the outside world, making it easy to drift into time-wasting pursuits.\n\nSo — I’ve convinced myself that mimetic traps are a real thing, and that I should be worried about them. Should you? If you find yourself vaguely dissatisfied with your work, unable to describe coherently why you’re doing what you’re doing — yes, you probably should. “Why does this matter?” is an excellent way to gauge if you’ve drifted into a mimetic trap. If you find this question impossible to answer honestly, you’re probably wasting your time. Getting out is the hard part — that requires courage and diligent planning. It’s much easier to avoid falling in. But in either case, you’ll benefit from building a system that steers you towards productive, meaningful activity in the long run.\n\nMimetic environments are a serious problem only if you fall into one where you can’t enjoy the process. They’re a tool for amplifying ambition and diligence, and it’s up to you to apply this tool to yourself wisely. This requires some care. It’s important to have a strong learning signal — a fast feedback loop between effort expended and success. This way, you’ll know quickly what it takes to succeed, and whether you can be happy doing so. Look for environments where competitors see themselves as playing a game, rather than fighting for survival — this prevents rankings within the hierarchy from becoming an existential problem.\n\nOutside of competitive environments, your peer group can be engineered to improve your decision making and steer you away from unhappy traps. The authors you read (or the podcasters you listen to) are a good place to start, because you have absolute control over their presence in your consciousness. Speaking with authors through their written work triggers the same neural circuits that produce imitation of desire. By stocking a bookshelf judiciously, you can express a preference over preferences — “what should I value? What do I want to spend my waking hours thinking about?” — and act on it through careful, honest reading. This engineering is safe: most authors exert their influence slowly, over hundreds of pages, and if the effect turns out to be undesirable, you need only put the book down. It’s cheap and reliable — if you want to emulate someone, start by reading what they read. Most importantly, it’s powerful, because authors form a large part of the meta-peer group that determines which communities and games you engage with.\n\nDon’t force yourself to do anything you hate. If you get too good at this, you won’t be able to figure out when to quit.\n\nEnjoy the process of whatever you’re doing — you’ll be happier, and much more likely to practice, which leads to better outcomes.\n\nMake sure your job has clear price signals for success and failure. Be suspicious of roles that compensate you with status or non-financial rewards.\n\nHold yourself to ambitious absolute standards in morals and productivity — write them down on post-it notes. You have an obligation to use yourself well, your time is valuable, and there are right and wrong ways to spend it.\n\nMaintain a diversity of pursuits — you want to ensure that, no matter how engrossed you become in one, you never forget that the others exist.\n\nJoin Twitter — there’s no better way to reduce tunnel vision.

Why we stopped making Einsteins - by Erik Hoel","link":"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/follow-up-why-we-stopped-making-einsteins?s=r","content":"Occasionally when a post gets a big reaction I’ll do a follow-up like this one; a kind of post-viral clearing of effluvia.\n\nNot that I’m unhappy. There’s been an incredible number of reactions to the previous essay, “ Why we stopped making Einsteins ,” which argued that a practice of learning via one-on-one tutoring was historically common among the aristocracy and declined, leaving us deprived of some of our most elegant minds.\n\nMany of the threads in the comments and replies to the piece are worth following up on, as they pertain to important questions, from whether the rich still do aristocratic tutoring in secret, to whether aristocratic tutoring might be possible in today’s world, to objections to the theory. Starting with:\n\nSeveral replies have speculated that the super rich are doing aristocratic tutoring in secret, with none of us the wiser. In my opinion, from what I vaguely know of the super rich, they mostly want to send their kids to Harvard. And college admissions dominates education so thoroughly that aristocratic tutoring has fallen out of favor, since it’s not explicitly geared toward, say, SAT test prep. Several professional tutors of the elite have reached out to me and confirmed this. Here’s one:\n\n\"Wish more of our clients asked for what you propose in your (wonderful) essay. Over 15 years working with elites around the world, I'm afraid I can only think of 2 or 3 who have sought what you suggest. The rest - test-prep :(\"\n\nThere are some outliers among the super rich like Elon Musk, who takes an idiosyncratic approach to his children’s education, sending them to a private school he created, Ad Astra. But from the description I’m not sure it counts as aristocratic tutoring :\n\nIn 2015. Musk spoke about Ad Astra, explaining that the educational model would be skills-oriented and have goals like:\n\nBe an alternative to the age segregation model. Musk says that separating children by age does not make sense for education, because students have different interests and abilities that are independent of how old they are.\n\nFocus on problem-solving. Instead of giving children ‘tools’ in a vacuum, they should be taught how to solve problems.\n\nGamification. The tycoon pointed out that he does not have to “encourage his children to play” since education through games is something natural for children.\n\nUnlike regular schools, these kids – aged seven to 14 – aren’t put into grades, and instead learn in teams.\n\nSo it seems like even the super rich don’t practice aristocratic tutoring anymore, instead looking to other forms of education, like gamification. This may be a significant missed opportunity.\n\nSeveral companies have reached out and said that they’d like to do aristocratic tutoring, or scale into it, or use AI to do it (e.g., The Collins Institute ).\n\nBut the list is slim—very slim. If you want to start an aristocratic tutoring start-up, it doesn’t seem like there’s much competition! Probably the harder aspect is demand. One big problem is that aristocratic tutoring, just in terms of the logistics, often necessitates homeschooling (as it often did in the past). And homeschooling is not in vogue, particularly among the elite.\n\nSome have pointed me to economist and education researcher Bryan Caplan as someone currently doing aristocratic tutoring with his kids (via homeschooling). Ironically, Caplan’s books are mostly about how nature trumps nurture, with titles like The Case Against Education. But Caplan appears to think, as I do that, that a lot of education’s null effect is simply how bad standard education is, and he takes a different approach to his own children, homeschooling them while supplementing with outside expertise in a manner that looks a lot like aristocratic tutoring:\n\n. . . my sons are plausibly the only 12-year-olds in the nation taking a college class in labor economics. . . . their peer group now includes Robin Hanson, Alex Tabarrok, Tyler Cowen, Garett Jones, and Nathaniel Bechhofer. That’s plausibly four standard deviations above whatever peer group they’d have in a conventional middle school.\n\nCaplan seems to be sneaking in this modern attempt at aristocratic tutoring through the cracks of the education system, saying that:\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Real World pays zero attention to what students do in middle school. The Caplan Family School won’t keep my kids out of good high schools; they can re-enter Fairfax County Public School in 9th grade. It won’t keep my kids out of good colleges; colleges don’t know what applicants did in middle school. And it won’t keep my kids from getting good jobs; there probably isn’t an employer in the country who asks how applicants did in 7th grade. So while homeschooling feels risky for high school, our next two years look like clear sailing.\n\nIn other words, you can homeschool your kids and therefore take the time to aristocratically tutor them (particularly if you’re an expert, or, if you’re well off, you could hire tutors instead) until they have to enter 9th grade, all without much downside—they can still get into Harvard (which is what the elite want for signaling purposes), because colleges don’t even look at school records from before high school. I think this is an interesting possibility and one I may pursue with my own kids.\n\nBlogger and psychiatrist Scott Alexander wrote a “Contra” reply wherein he disagreed that aristocratic tutoring was historically important or contributed to the decline of genius. His objections don’t strike me as particularly strong.\n\nFirst, Scott attempted to give some evidence that not all historical geniuses were tutored. To make his point he says:\n\nHoel argues that the decline in aristocratic tutoring is “why we stopped making Einsteins”. But then why did we stop making Newtons , Mozarts , Darwins , Pasteurs , Dickenses , and Edisons ?\n\nI’m not sure why he picked these examples, as the majority of names here were tutored. As I said in the piece, it’s actually hard to figure out if people didn’t have tutors and/or governesses (who acted as tutors), and oftentimes family members like mothers and fathers took on the role of the classic aristocratic tutor, and often enough none of this is deigned to be mentioned in high-level sources like Wikipedia. Of those names:\n\nMozart was tutored 1-on-1 by his father (a musician and, perhaps more importantly, a music teacher), a relationship that has been described, on Mozart’s father’s side, as “ obsessive .” He had no other formal education.\n\nThomas Edison was likely homeschooled and tutored by his mother , who used to be a professional schoolteacher.\n\nCharles Dickens was tutored by his mother (who knew Latin and, as a Barrow, was better educated than the family she married into). Indeed, that’s where Charles got his love of literature from. According to Charles Dickens: A Life , her tutoring in literature and reading makes\n\n“. . . Elizabeth Dickens sound like a mother who cherished her son through careful teaching which sparked his imagination, and from then on words were associated with pleasure and he was set on his path.\"\n\nCharles Darwin grew up in a household with governesses (who looked after but also taught children):\n\n. . . as the children grew older a succession of governesses was employed. A favourite was Miss Thorley, who stayed for many years, and she was followed by a German governess, Miss Ludwig, who seems to have been in regular employment for some years and then sporadically.\n\nand I think it’s likely he had male tutors as well—certainly his own children grew up in such a household , they write about their tutors in their letters, and it’s hard to believe that their situation, a rich aristocratic family in a huge manor house with a servant’s quarters and governesses and tutors, was different from what Charles himself grew up with. And we know for a fact Charles certainly supplemented with tutors later in life as well; in the essay I give an example of Darwin hiring a freedman tutor when he was merely 16 to point out the casualness and ubiquity of tutoring as an educational supplement. He particularly needed help with math:\n\nIn the summer vacation a private tutor was engaged, not so much perhaps to brush up his \"maths\" as to try and drive some into him; but he had, as he describes it, \"no natural turn\" for mathematics and gave up before mastering the first part of algebra and \"loathing surds and the Binomial Theorem\". In later life he much regretted that he had not mastered the first principles of mathematics as it might have helped him in his work. Indeed, he was right. If only he had been a man with even a nodding acquaintance with mathematics he might have forestalled Mendel, and the mechanism of heredity would have been laid before the world by him instead of having to wait to be pronounced by de Vries, Correns and Tschermak following their rediscovery in 1900 of Mendel's work.\n\nSo, while it’s tough to imagine, there’s some historical evidence that Darwin would have been an even greater genius with more tutoring than what he received.\n\nNewton ? A more complicated case. Newton first goes to a school at the age of 12. What was he doing before that time? Details I can find are sparse, but if he was homeschooled it seems likely he was tutored by a parent. Far more relevantly, education itself was quite different then. Even learning in college was much closer to what we now consider tutoring. Here’s a comment on Scott’s blog by Aneesh Mulye pointing this out:\n\nNewton and Darwin are anti-examples. . . Oxford and Cambridge are *known* for their primary method of education being... tutoring. And I don't mean one-on-many, I mean 1:1 to 1:3 ratios at most. That's literally what they're famous for. That's what's produced the strings of geniuses we see, including even modern eminences such as Dawkins (Dawkins' tutor was Niko Tinbergen, founder of ethology and later Nobelist; the description Dawkins gives of what that was like is astounding, and makes for a stunning and depressing contrast with the meatgrinder/factory model that's the default otherwise — you realise the later may not in fact deserve at all the name 'education').\n\nSo *all* the statements of the kind 'and then he went to Oxbridge, which is a totally normal education' are a major category error. That's not how they do things there; over there, they actually bother to press the 'Win' button occasionally.\n\nThis is backed up from historical sources of what being in Cambridge at this time would be like. Consider Never at Rest , a biography of Newton, that says:\n\nThe system of tutors within the colleges [of Cambridge], which had largely replaced university lectures, had followed its own peculiar development. . . Newton’s tutor, Benjamin Pulleyn , was the champion pupil monger of Trinity during the period Newton was an undergraduate. . . [Newton’s] tutor Pulleyan may have recognized his pupil’s brilliance and tried to help him by enlisting Isaac Barrow, the one man in Trinity fit to judge his competence in the unorthodox studies he had undertaken.\n\nSo Newton was homeschooled until he was 12, and then at the age of 17 was one-on-one tutored at Cambridge in a tutoring system that had replaced lectures, again, making him a pretty debatable case.\n\nLouis Pasteur is the only one of the examples who was definitely not tutored. . . unless you again count that the style of education at these top colleges was, at the time, based much more on tutoring—and indeed, Louis Pasteur was later appointed as a “tutor” himself.\n\nSo of the six examples Scott Alexander gives as supposed non-tutored geniuses, two were tutored by their parents (who just happened to be professional teachers). Another, Darwin, had governesses and definitely supplemented his later education with tutoring, and possibly his early education as well (at minimum, we know his rich aristocratic family was in the habit of this). A further two, Newton and Dickens, are more debatable, but both show some evidence of tutoring, depending on how one fills in the gaps (which an expert may be able to fill in better than myself), although Dicken’s experience ends quite early. Only the last of the examples, Pasteur, went through the school system in a manner very much like today, unless we include that elite universities of the time still ran on things like tutoring systems.\n\nOverall, if we look into the lives of most of these figures we see a society awash with tutoring—we see mothers tutoring, fathers tutoring, we see hired tutors and governesses, we see an elite education system built around tutoring, and we see the figures themselves becoming tutors.\n\nThe problem seems to be that Scott read the essay and came away with “There’s Definitely Only One Thing that Went Wrong with Producing Geniuses and This Is It.” He even says that\n\nI think efforts like Hoel’s to find the One Thing That Went Wrong in producing geniuses are doomed to fail.\n\nAnd he implies the same with:\n\n. . . Hoel is making a stronger claim: that there are almost no geniuses today. For aristocratic tutoring to explain that, we would need for almost all past geniuses to be aristocratically tutored. But as far as I can tell, that isn’t true.\n\nYet, in the essay I never said that the decline of genius is due fully and completely to a lack of tutoring. Personally, I do think that “ ideas are getting harder to find .” Indeed, evidence of this hypothesis is linked in the original essay. I just don’t think it explains the full decline, and aristocratic tutoring is the missing puzzle piece. Therefore, we should expect to find examples of historical geniuses without aristocratic tutors, and we should also expect to still find geniuses after aristocratic tutoring ended, even now, just at a reduced rate per the effective population (which is indeed what is observed). This makes most of Scott’s criticisms moot, since he’s arguing against a mono-causal straw man.\n\nWhy even look for a missing puzzle piece in the decline of genius? As I pointed out, the “ideas are getting harder to find” thesis implies two questionable assumptions: (a) science and arts are “mineable” or “exhaustible” in exactly the same way since the decline seems similar in both, and (b) that ideas got harder to find in such a way it counterbalanced the explosion of free information to everyone on Earth in a period of under 20 years due to the internet. Scott addressed neither of these points, and it’s complications like these why I don’t think the explanation of simply “ideas getting harder to find” is adequate.\n\nFinally, Scott also briefly suggests that there are fields in which we still do aristocratic tutoring (he names music and Chess). Scott’s evidence for the case of music is his own brother, who was tutored by a famous jazz musician, and went on to become. . . a famous musician. Which looks like a successful case of contemporary aristocratic tutoring to me. But Scott seems to think this is so common we should have Mozarts everywhere now, and we don’t, so the overall hypothesis is wrong. A classical musician disagreed, commenting that:\n\nThe art has indeed declined on the compositional side, and in fact private tutoring on composing is basically non existent (it was common in the past). In my career as a classical musician I have only heard of private tutoring for composing as a crutch when stuff weren't going well during the normal, boring and uninspiring teaching hours in the music school. Similar to normal school.\n\nChess (and sports) are the two fields I would name wherein we still regularly do the sort of intense one-on-one tutoring we saw historically in intellectual subjects, and indeed, both chess and sports records have been being shattered decade upon decade very consistently: Magnus Carlsen is a better player than Bobby Fischer, Roger Federer is a better player than Andre Agassi, etc.\n\nSo, while I appreciate Scott engaging with the post, none of the objections to the theory seem very strong to me, as they either elide historical details, assume that aristocratic tutoring is occurring now at the same rate (which tutors of the elite disagree with), or assume the thesis implies mono-causality or universality.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Reading Technical Literature - LessWrong","link":"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JZTBonFhSxGbXpS5w/improving-enjoyment-and-retention-reading-technical","content":"45\n\nA little background on myself first – I am currently studying to become involved with aging rejuvenation therapies like SENS.\n\nThis requires learning quite a lot about molecular biology. Which is fine, because I find cell biology quite interesting. The problem is naturally that textbooks and technical literature on the subject often make very little effort to be interesting.\n\nMany of the books I’ve been reading lately are largely lacking in energy. And I was finding my mind was often drifting away from what I was reading and generally just not enjoying the process. Which was bad, because I need to spend a lot of time doing it.\n\nI asked myself, do I hate learning about molecular biology and engineering? Should I shift my goals to something I’m more interested in? But, I didn’t seem to actually be disinterested in the subject. I loved talking about what I’d learned. And I frequently thought about it with interest. I was passionate about the goal of defeating aging. So the problem then was probably the books themselves.\n\nSo then the question was: how do I make boringly written biology books fun to read? Find better books? Well unfortunately, based on my research, the only biology books written to be interesting tend to be focusing on on other sects of the science; most good molecular biology books are boring. If anyone knows of any books on the subject that are unusually well written, please let me know. But I couldn't find any.\n\nSo I looked for the bright spots: where reading was fun. What makes reading a novel fun? I asked. Interesting story, character interactions, suspense, humor, dramatic scenes.\n\nNone of these are incorporated in molecular biology books and publications that I can find. But the answer was still there: visualize what I read. But not just visualize like the little diagrams of cellular interactions books usually give you – like stupid, over-the-top, Hollywood-status visualization. I had to make it dramatic. I had to mentally reconstruct the biology of a cell in massive, fast, and explosive terms.\n\nSuddenly, I was reading about genetic engineering with a grin on my face; because I was visualizing a cackling mad scientist taking a jackhammer to a gene sequence.\n\nWhich, yes, is totally not what is happening in any way, but I remember what I read better because the unusual things are what stick in human memories; just reading a passage normally makes it easy to forget what I’ve read. And the weirdness seems to make the parts around it more memorable, so I’m remembering what I read a lot better, I find.\n\nMost of the time I try not to make it that absurd. But if I imagine spliceosomes blasting introns out of RNA molecules or cell lysis as an overstated explosion of a cell I simply remember the concepts better. It isn’t the most accurate view of reality, but I'm aware of that when I think back on it, and it’s better than not remembering it.\n\nBut this strategy eventually gets a little tiring to maintain alone, I find, so I had to add in a second technique. Every time my mind wants to start wandering I stop, close my eyes, and refocus on what I'm reading, I recite ‘ Tsuyoku Naritai ’, and why I want to become stronger, what I have to protect. And then I continue. I find this little technique to make a massive difference. It reorients me, so that I continue to concentrate and it briefly reminds of what I'm pursuing and why. And if that doesn't give you the motivation to continue you should probably find a different project.\n\nA third useful strategy has been planning how long I will read instead of how much and then break up the time spent reading over the course of a day. First, it encourages reading to understand fully rather than reading to finish fifty pages. Also, I find it tends to get me to read more pages, despite defeating the motivation to go fast. Time goals just take the pressure of failing to complete work off a bit, I find. As an example, I read about a 160 pages of a molecular biology textbook today using an input-based time goal. I used to plan for fifty pages of a similar type of material on a regular day and sometimes not finish even that. To be fair, I'm spending more time reading now, but I think using input based goals instead of output goals had a part in that that.\n\nThe other results I've gotten from these strategies have been pretty good as well. I’ve been trying to quantify my happiness lately, on a scale where every full number corresponds to doubled enjoyment, and now that I’m doing these three things my average happiness while reading technical passages has gone up by nearly a full point. My enjoyment of technical literature has gone from somewhere around 'yeah, it’s ok, I guess' to 'happy' while reading. And because it’s just more fun to do, it helps me to spend more time reading about molecular biology, more time working towards an unaging future.\n\nAnyway, I thought I’d post the ideas in case they helped anyone else out (although the first might not work as well for things that are harder to visualize). I’m also interested if anyone does anything similar (or different) to increase their enjoyment of similar texts.\n\nReading habits/techniques/strategies (second post on the topic)\n\nReading habits/techniques/strategies (second post on the topic)","tokenFrequency":{"easi":1,"reconstruct":1,"realiti":1,"focus":1,"sudden":1,"spend":3,"doubl":1,"simpli":1,"work":3,"general":1,"find":11,"mind":2,"memori":1,"stop":1,"first":3,"case":1,"near":1,"three":1,"get":2,"rememb":4,"long":1,"i'd":2,"'m":4,"imagin":1,"output":1,"rejuven":1,"suspens":1,"day":2,"pretti":1,"plan":2,"despit":1,"mani":1,"recit":1,"bit":1,"sen":1,"blast":1,"novel":1,"effort":1,"current":1,"":18,"interest":7,"correspond":1,"naritai":1,"rna":1,"let":1,"none":1,"similar":3,"spot":1,"part":2,"accur":1,"anyth":1,"techniqu":2,"seem":2,"somewher":1,"background":1,"input":1,"unag":1,"anyway":1,"toward":1,"fulli":1,"know":2,"usual":1,"therapi":1,"bad":1,"back":1,"read":24,"goal":6,"idea":1,"passion":1,"scientist":1,"way":1,"exampl":1,"didn't":1,"bore":2,"weird":1,"reorient":1,"much":1,"view":1,"quit":2,"rather":1,"requir":1,"explos":2,"finish":2,"question":1,"studi":1,"cours":1,"harder":1,"time":9,"age":2,"actual":1,"materi":1,"yeah":1,"second":3,"scene":1,"use":4,"thing":3,"public":1,"often":2,"defeat":2,"still":1,"give":2,"happi":3,"spent":1,"human":1,"eventu":1,"ve":1,"answer":1,"full":2,"pleas":1,"humor":1,"overst":1,"like":3,"total":1,"els":1,"strategi":3,"disinterest":1,"project":1,"tsuyoku":1,"lot":3,"wander":1,"gone":2,"take":2,"larg":1,"talk":1,"book":9,"i'm":4,"think":2,"research":1,"visual":5,"want":2,"literatur":2,"understand":1,"eye":1,"bright":1,"complet":1,"close":1,"doesn":1,"well":4,"also":2,"molecul":1,"frequent":1,"learn":3,"fast":2,"intron":1,"–":2,"genet":1,"grin":1,"might":1,"unusu":2,"enjoy":4,"mental":1,"problem":2,"fair":1,"written":3,"gene":1,"sometim":1,"text":1,"ask":2,"averag":1,"littl":5,"engin":2,"isn't":1,"fail":1,"yes":1,"briefli":1,"lack":1,"happen":1,"couldn":1,"alon":1,"motiv":2,"anyon":3,"pursu":1,"better":5,"technic":3,"concept":1,"unfortun":1,"interact":2,"massiv":2,"continu":3,"today":1,"stupid":1,"molecular":6,"around":2,"habitstechniquesstrategi":2,"stori":1,"sequenc":1,"term":1,"energi":1,"scienc":1,"encourag":1,"awar":1,"start":1,"diagram":1,"overthetop":1,"topic":2,"stick":1,"probabl":2,"break":1,"tend":2,"textbook":2,"charact":1,"quantifi":1,"i'v":3,"remind":1,"normal":1,"drift":1,"tire":1,"someth":1,"stronger":1,"spliceosom":1,"futur":1,"tri":2,"memor":1,"scale":1,"post":3,"subject":3,"add":1,"incorpor":1,"becom":2,"everi":2,"differ":3,"number":1,"type":1,"process":1,"jackhamm":1,"passag":2,"third":1,"refocus":1,"go":1,"even":1,"need":1,"inputbas":1,"concentr":1,"dramat":2,"involv":1,"face":1,"base":2,"forget":1,"page":4,"look":1,"although":1,"away":1,"protect":1,"cellular":1,"fun":4,"absurd":1,"increas":1,"natur":1,"fine":1,"cackl":1,"gotten":1,"160":1,"thought":2,"instead":2,"help":2,"good":2,"result":1,"biolog":10,"love":1,"sect":1,"pressur":1,"point":1,"make":8,"cell":4,"mad":1,"it":3,"late":2,"ok":1,"45":1,"hate":1,"shift":1,"hollywoodstatus":1,"regular":1,"guess":1,"lysi":1,"maintain":1,"fifti":2}},"20097":{"id":"20097","title":"how can we be the right kind of together? - by Ava","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/how-can-we-be-the-right-kind-of-together?s=w","content":"how can we be the right kind of together? in/dependence\n\nA couple months ago, a friend asked me about being more independent. That’s a loaded topic for me, since historically I haven’t been as independent as I’d like to be. I’ve done things that make me seem independent—leaving college, living alone, traveling alone, working on things by myself—but it always felt like posturing. I don’t know if I really enjoyed those experiences as much as I should have—if I was really present with myself in the time I spent alone. I was a lonely child and even as an adult I was always afraid of real solitude. I’ve never liked being all by myself on a Friday night. I was always dating someone (the longest I’ve been single since I was 15 is probably six months). To me, that’s clearly the sign of someone who doesn’t enjoy their own company.\n\nI think it’s only this year that I’ve started to actually feel independent, and I’ve been trying to understand the difference. I think the biggest thing I’ve realized is that I used to externalize way too much. Like, if I felt bored or antsy or upset, I would seek out a friend to help dull the acuteness of that negative feeling. I felt like the world wasn’t safe—when I was all alone, trying to distract myself by reading a book or watching a movie, I felt untethered and uncomfortable. I wasn’t good at self-soothing. So in a way I was super dependent on my friends and partners because I needed them in order to regulate my emotions. At the same time, I’ve always been headstrong, individualistic, and reluctant to compromise. “You always think you’re right” is the criticism I get most often from people who know me really well (I can sometimes fool people who know me less well into thinking I’m reasonable, lol). So for a long time this created dissonance in my personal life because 1) I needed people too much and 2) I resented needing them, since it was incompatible with my values.\n\nFor most of us, the story of independence is the story of giving up codependence. In order to change, I had to accept that other people aren’t fundamentally responsible for my emotional state. I’m responsible for my emotional state. I think I’ve realized this most acutely through writing, which is so individual and painful—no one can really help me with it. It has to be self-generated. Other people can help you edit, and give you feedback, and read over your drafts, but it has to come from you. That’s how everything works, right? No one can help you self-actualize except you.\n\nWhen I’m upset or uncertain, I feel so alone in my sadness. But sometimes those are the most important moments—those are the moments that shake me loose. To be able to breathe through them, to watch them pass through me, reminds me of the true nature of things. We are both wildly alone and completely interconnected. Even when I am apart from people, they are always with me, in me. I just don’t always see it. (I’m remembering the day I tripped too hard in a Californian seaside motel and wandered out at night to get pizza convinced I was fused with everything in the universe. What a feeling.)\n\nIn an essay from Melissa Broder’s So Sad Today she writes, “getting clean off of people isn’t the same as getting sober off of alcohol and drugs. Since I’m an alcoholic, there are very clear boundaries as to what I don’t do. I can’t text alcohol. Dealers don’t send nudes. What’s more, alcohol and drugs are pervasive in America, but people are even more pervasive. People are everywhere. Hot people. You can abstain from alcohol and drugs. You can’t abstain from people.” Being independent in a healthy way doesn’t require avoidance, it requires self-differentiation: staying yourself in the presence of people who are important to you.\n\nThe question of how can we be the right kind of together is for me the question of how we can love people and depend on people while also taking full responsibility for ourselves. From Conscious Loving by Gay Hendricks and Kathlyn Hendricks:\n\nOne of our co-dependent clients in recovery put the problem very eloquently after a breakthrough session: “Now I feel a center of light and God-consciousness in me, but I’ve never been able to contact or express it before. Instead, all my thoughts were about how I could manipulate people to give me what I want or how I could get them to like me. I’ve never had a single pure thought before.” This man had made a profound discovery: When you can break through your approval and control programming, there is a natural, organic spiritual essence within you that can be consciously experienced. As long as we try to control ourselves and others, and as long as we strive to get others to like us, that spiritual essence is obscured. When we wake up and start loving ourselves, we claim our divine right.”\n\nBeing alone in the correct way seems to be about this inner knowing: a compassionate, accurate sense of who you are, and with that, an ability to be close to others without wanting to control their decisions. The ability to express need (“I’d like to see you tonight!”) without dependence (“My week is ruined if I can’t see you tonight”).\n\nI still don’t know if I’m as independent as I would like to be. I think I have a truer sense of self than I did two years ago (which is weird to say because I don’t really believe the “self” exists the way most people conceptualize it. Language is tricky. But you get the idea). Less approval-seeking, more sincere. Less hysterical, more rooted. When I make decisions I need less input from others. But I still need people. Paradoxically, I think I had to admit how much I need people in order to have a healthier relationship with them. We are all interdependent and deeply connected (you must be sick of me saying this by now, but: love is the point of living).

An afternoon arrest, she thought, would be less frightening for her sons.\n\nElif finished dressing her youngest and watched police search her family's home before they took her into custody — for using a messaging app the government deems seditious.\n\nShe knew the arrest was coming. She'd already lost her job, because traces of the app known as Bylock were found on her phone.\n\nBut Elif is adamant she never used or downloaded it.\n\nHaving Bylock on your phone or even knowing someone who did is to become an instant pariah in Turkey, resulting in isolation, shame, a lost livelihood or worse.\n\nThe Turkish government under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan links Bylock with treason, because of the app's alleged connection to followers of Fethullah Gülen, the man the Turkish government believes is behind the deadly 2016 coup attempt. Gülen denies the allegations.\n\nAlleged Bylock users are a large part of the nearly 150,000 Turks detained, arrested or forced from their jobs under state of emergency decrees since the summer of 2016.\n\nAn estimated 30,000 are believed to be among the innocent swept up in this particular campaign, victims of the chaos, confusion and fear in Turkey.\n\n\"Terrifying\" is how Tuncay Beşikci describes what people like Elif are living through. The digital forensic expert said they are being \"blamed for crimes they did not commit at all.\"\n\nA former teacher, Elif has been branded a traitor and charged with terrorism. (She asked that we only use her first name to avoid jeopardizing her case and to protect her sons.)\n\n\"The thing I want most is to be cleared,\" Elif said.\n\nAnd her best chance at doing that are Beşikci, fellow digital expert Koray Peksayar and lawyer Ali Aktaş, who have spent months investigating thousands of cases like Elif's. In so doing, they say they have uncovered a massive cyber-conspiracy.\n\nBylock was a free messaging app used between 2014 and 2016. Available in the Google and Apple app stores for part of that time, it was a less sophisticated version of Whatsapp, but more secretive — you could only communicate with others on the network if you knew their usernames.\n\nBeşikçi and Peksayar say it was designed by Gülenists to communicate with each other. Beşikçi believes the app was also a way for the organization to surveil its own members.\n\nBeşikçi said Bylock was downloaded roughly half a million times and had 215,000 registered users. About 100,000 of them were identified by the Turkish government as \"real users.\"\n\nMany people downloaded the app willingly, but many who had no traces of it on their phones are also being accused — and Beşikçi and Peksayar have now shown why.\n\nBeşikçi said it was due to a single line of code, which created a window \"one pixel high, one pixel wide\" — essentially invisible to the human eye — to Bylock.net. Hypothetically, people could be accused of accessing the site without having knowingly viewed it.\n\nThat line redirected people to the Bylock server using several other applications, including a Spotify-like music app called Freezy and apps to look up prayer times or find the direction of Mecca. Some people have been accused because someone they shared a wifi connection with was linked to Bylock.\n\nBeşikçi and Peksayar believe it was a deliberate \"trap,\" and allege that the creators were trying to conceal who was and wasn't a member of the Gülen organization after Gülen himself fell out of favour with the Turkish government amid concerns the group was gaining too much power in the state.\n\nAkif Demir, a self-described conservative nationalist, wished the worst on people accused of using Bylock and being associated with the Gülenists. That is, until authorities said he was one of them.\n\n\"We were ignorant,\" the 29-year-old high school teacher concedes.\n\nIn October 2016, when his wife was pregnant with their first child, Demir was called into his principal's office. He wouldn't be allowed to work at the school — or anywhere else for that matter — anymore. He had been deemed a Bylock user.\n\n\"If they said, 'Write a script about the worst-case scenario about your life,' I could never have imagined this, that I would be accused of being a member of a terror group,\" Demir said.\n\nHe handed over his phone and made a statement to police even before they came to arrest him, determined to prove his innocence. When he was questioned, Demir said police asked him about a single phone call placed a year earlier.\n\nHe searched his memory — it was a real estate agent he'd called when looking for his first home with his wife. That agent was also accused of using Bylock.\n\nMonths later, with no progress in his case, Demir's wife found social media messages Aktaş, Beşikçi and Peksayar had been spreading, telling potential victims they may be able to clear their names. Demir sent them a video pleading his case, along with proof from Google — purchases in the app store showed he had downloaded a prayer time app that experts were showing was linked with Bylock.net.\n\nThe Turkish government and the country's courts rarely admit they are wrong, but in December, they revealed the gravity of the mistake they'd made by publishing a list of 11,480 mobile phone numbers. Each number represented a person wrongly accused of terrorism in the Bylock affair.\n\nDemir's phone number was on the list. He considers himself lucky.\n\nSome, including Tayyip Sina Dogan, sat in prison for months. The helicopter technician was on the helicopter that transported President Erdogan as the coup unfolded in July 2016. He has only just returned to his post.\n\nBeşikçi said the severity of the accusations pushed some to attempt suicide.\n\n\"Some called me at midnight crying, begging me, because we were the only ones listening to them,\" Beşikçi said. \"We convinced them. We told them we're working on it.\"\n\nOthers could not wait. There are reports that four people on the list took their own lives before they could be exonerated.\n\nAktaş said Bylock \"was seen as a definitive, important piece of evidence\" in the hunt to weed out Gülenists. Accepting Bylock cases was dangerous; any more than six at a time would have put him in jeopardy, Aktaş said.\n\nAktaş, who is based in Antalya on Turkey's Mediterranean coast, describes an atmosphere \"where everyone was suspicious of everyone else,\" pitting neighbour against neighbour, sibling against sibling.\n\n\"There was no room for argument,\" with prosecutors and judges, Aktaş said.\n\nThe team believes a few factors helped them finally convince prosecutors and judges that so many of the accused were innocent. For one, there were concerns people within the government were being falsely accused.\n\nBeşikçi was already an accredited forensic expert with the Istanbul courts and had connections in the capital, Ankara. Peksayar and Aktaş have connections to a nationalist party in Turkey; if not close to the government, they're not outspoken voices against it, either.\n\nAkif Demir is now back at work. After months of driving by his school heartbroken, he said he feels indebted to the team that worked to save him.\n\nWhile the team is being flooded with calls of thanks and promises of prayers from people now cleared, they're still getting calls and Twitter messages from people still desperate for help.\n\nOn the day I was there, Beşikçi said he has about 200 mobile phones in his office to investigate.\n\n\"We have 81 cities in Turkey — I have victims from each and every city,\" he said.\n\nElif has yet to taste the happiness of freedom — her phone number was not on the recent list of wrongly accused.\n\nHer husband, a member of the Turkish navy, lost his job simply because of the accusations against her.\n\nAfter a week in custody, Elif and her family have been living with her parents in another Turkish city. Like many of the victims, they are surviving on the kindness of family and friends.\n\n\"Living in fear is an awful thing,\" Elif said. \"What's going to happen?\"\n\nAktaş thinks the remaining thousands he and the forensic experts believe were wrongly accused will be released eventually. He said the climate in Turkey, at least on this file, is changing.\n\nThese people \"are owed an apology and compensation,\" he said.\n\nPayment on those debts, and the release of the innocent, will come, Aktaş said. \"Even if it happens late, it will happen.\"\n\nNil Köksal is the host of World Report, CBC's flagship national radio news show.

by Shaun Usher - Letters of Note","link":"https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/live-a-life-worth-living?s=r","content":"Please note, today’s letter is a tough read. But it’s also beautiful, and contains advice and a perspective worth sharing.\n\nOn 19 March 2018, almost five years after being diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer, forty-two-year-old Julie Yip-Williams died, leaving behind a husband and two daughters. Her early years had been anything but easy. Born blind in Vietnam, at two months of age she was almost euthanised on the orders of a grandmother who deemed her to be defective; years later, as an older child, she sailed to Hong Kong with her family and hundreds of other refugees in search of a more peaceful life, eventually settling down in the US where her life improved drastically. She was soon given partial sight by a surgeon, studied at Harvard, and became a successful lawyer, but then, in her thirties, she was struck down by the illness that would kill her. It was then that she began to write what would become a posthumously published memoir, The Unwinding of the Miracle. In July 2017, a year before she passed away, Yip-Williams wrote the following letter to her young daughters.\n\n(Heartfelt thanks to John Williams, Julie’s widower, for allowing this to feature in Letters of Note: Mothers . If you would like these letters to be sent to your inbox, subscribe to the newsletter.)\n\nI have solved all the logistical problems resulting from my death that I can think of — I am hiring a very reasonably priced cook for you and Daddy; I have left a list of instructions about who your dentist is and when your school tuition needs to be paid and when to renew the violin rental contract and the identity of the piano tuner. In the coming days, I will make videos about all the ins and outs of the apartment, so that everyone knows where the air filters are and what kind of dog food Chipper eats. But I realized that these things are the low-hanging fruit, the easy-to-solve but relatively unimportant problems of the oh so mundane.\n\nI realized that I would have failed you greatly as your mother if I did not try to ease your pain from my loss, if I didn’t at least attempt to address what will likely be the greatest question of your young lives. You will forever be the kids whose mother died of cancer, have people looking at you with some combination of sympathy and pity (which you will no doubt resent, even if everyone means well). That fact of your mother dying will weave into the fabric of your lives like a glaring stain on an otherwise pristine tableau. You will ask as you look around at all the other people who still have their parents, Why did my mother have to get sick and die? It isn’t fair, you will cry. And you will want so painfully for me to be there to hug you when your friend is mean to you, to look on as your ears are being pierced, to sit in the front row clapping loudly at your music recitals, to be that annoying parent insisting on another photo with the college graduate, to help you get dressed on your wedding day, to take your newborn babe from your arms so you can sleep. And every time you yearn for me, it will hurt all over again and you will wonder why.\n\nI don’t know if my words could ever ease your pain. But I would be remiss if I did not try.\n\nMy seventh-grade history teacher, Mrs. Olson, a batty eccentric but a phenomenal teacher, used to rebut our teenage protestations of “That’s not fair!” (for example, when she sprang a pop quiz on us or when we played what was called the “Unfair” trivia game) with “Life is not fair. Get used to it!” Somehow, we grow up thinking that there should be fairness, that people should be treated fairly, that there should be equality of treatment as well as opportunity. That expectation must be derived from growing up in a rich country where the rule of law is so firmly entrenched. Even at the tender age of five, both of you were screaming about fairness as if it were some fundamental right (as in it wasn’t fair that Belle got to go to see a movie when Mia did not). So perhaps those expectations of fairness and equity are also hardwired into the human psyche and our moral compass. I’m not sure.\n\nWhat I do know for sure is that Mrs. Olson was right. Life is not fair. You would be foolish to expect fairness, at least when it comes to matters of life and death, matters outside the scope of the law, matters that cannot be engineered or manipulated by human effort, matters that are distinctly the domain of God or luck or fate or some other unknowable, incomprehensible force.\n\nAlthough I did not grow up motherless, I suffered in a different way and understood at an age younger than yours that life is not fair. I looked at all the other kids who could drive and play tennis and who didn’t have to use a magnifying glass to read, and it pained me in a way that maybe you can understand now. People looked at me with pity, too, which I loathed. I was denied opportunities, too; I was always the scorekeeper and never played in the games during PE. My mother didn’t think it worthwhile to have me study Chinese after English school, as my siblings did, because she assumed I wouldn’t be able to see the characters. (Of course, later on, I would study Chinese throughout college and study abroad and my Chinese would surpass my siblings’.) For a child, there is nothing worse than being different, in that negative, pitiful way. I was sad a lot. I cried in my lonely anger. Like you, I had my own loss, the loss of vision, which involved the loss of so much more. I grieved. I asked why. I hated the unfairness of it all.\n\nMy sweet babies, I do not have the answer to the question of why, at least not now and not in this life. But I do know that there is incredible value in pain and suffering, if you allow yourself to experience it, to cry, to feel sorrow and grief, to hurt. Walk through the fire and you will emerge on the other end, whole and stronger. I promise. You will ultimately find truth and beauty and wisdom and peace. You will understand that nothing lasts forever, not pain, or joy. You will understand that joy cannot exist without sadness. Relief cannot exist without pain. Compassion cannot exist without cruelty. Courage cannot exist without fear. Hope cannot exist without despair. Wisdom cannot exist without suffering. Gratitude cannot exist without deprivation. Paradoxes abound in this life. Living is an exercise in navigating within them.\n\nI was deprived of sight. And yet, that single unfortunate physical condition changed me for the better. Instead of leaving me wallowing in self-pity, it made me more ambitious. It made me more resourceful. It made me smarter. It taught me to ask for help, to not be ashamed of my physical shortcoming. It forced me to be honest with myself and my limitations, and eventually to be honest with others. It taught me strength and resilience.\n\nYou will be deprived of a mother. As your mother, I wish I could protect you from the pain. But also as your mother, I want you to feel the pain, to live it, embrace it, and then learn from it. Be stronger people because of it, for you will know that you carry my strength within you. Be more compassionate people because of it; empathize with those who suffer in their own ways. Rejoice in life and all its beauty because of it; live with special zest and zeal for me. Be grateful in a way that only someone who lost her mother so early can, in your understanding of the precariousness and preciousness of life. This is my challenge to you, my sweet girls, to take an ugly tragedy and transform it into a source of beauty, love, strength, courage, and wisdom.\n\nMany may disagree, but I have always believed, always, even when I was a precocious little girl crying alone in my bed, that our purpose in this life is to experience everything we possibly can, to understand as much of the human condition as we can squeeze into one lifetime, however long or short that may be. We are here to feel the complex range of emotions that come with being human. And from those experiences, our souls expand and grow and learn and change, and we understand a little more about what it really means to be human. I call it the evolution of the soul. Know that your mother lived an incredible life that was filled with more than her “fair” share of pain and suffering, first with her blindness and then with cancer. And I allowed that pain and suffering to define me, to change me, but for the better.\n\nIn the years since my diagnosis, I have known love and compassion that I never knew possible; I have witnessed and experienced for myself the deepest levels of human caring, which humbled me to my core and compelled me to be a better person. I have known a mortal fear that was crushing, and yet I overcame that fear and found courage. The lessons that blindness and then cancer have taught me are too many for me to recount here, but I hope, when you read what follows, you will understand how it is possible to be changed in a positive way by tragedy and you will learn the true value of suffering. The worth of a person’s life lies not in the number of years lived; rather it rests on how well that person has absorbed the lessons of that life, how well that person has come to understand and distill the multiple, messy aspects of the human experience. While I would have chosen to stay with you for much longer had the choice been mine, if you can learn from my death, if you accepted my challenge to be better people because of my death, then that would bring my spirit inordinate joy and peace.\n\nYou will feel alone and lonely, and yet, understand that you are not alone. It is true that we walk this life alone, because we feel what we feel singularly and each of us makes our own choices. But it is possible to reach out and find those like you, and in so doing you will feel not so lonely. This is another one of life’s paradoxes that you will learn to navigate. First and foremost, you have each other to lean on. You are sisters, and that gives you a bond of blood and common experiences that is like no other. Find solace in one another. Always forgive and love one another. Then there’s Daddy. Then there are Titi and Uncle Mau and Aunt Nancy and Aunt Caroline and Aunt Sue and so many dear friends, all of whom knew and loved me so well — who think of you and pray for you and worry about you. All of these people’s loving energy surrounds you so that you will not feel so alone.\n\nAnd last, wherever I may go, a part of me will always be with you. My blood flows within you. You have inherited the best parts of me. Even though I won’t physically be here, I will be watching over you.\n\nSometimes, when you practice your instruments, I close my eyes so I can hear better. And when I do, I am often overcome with this absolute knowing that whenever you play the violin or the piano, when you play it with passion and commitment, the music with its special power will beckon me and I will be there. I will be sitting right there, pushing you to do it again and again and again, to count, to adjust your elbow, to sit properly. And then I will hug you and tell you how you did a great job and how very proud I am of you. I promise. Even long after you have chosen to stop playing, I will still come to you in those extraordinary and ordinary moments in life when you live with a complete passion and commitment. It might be while you’re standing atop a mountain, marveling at exceptional beauty and filled with pride in your ability to reach the summit, or when you hold your baby in your arms for the first time or when you are crying because someone or something has broken your tender heart or maybe when you’re miserably pulling an all-nighter for school or work. Know that your mother once felt as you feel and that I am there hugging you and urging you on. I promise.\n\nI have often dreamed that when I die, I will finally know what it would be like to see the world without visual impairment, to see far into the distance, to see the minute details of a bird, to drive a car. Oh, how I long to have perfect vision, even after all these years without. I long for death to make me whole, to give me what was denied me in this life. I believe this dream will come true. Similarly, when your time comes, I will be there waiting for you, so that you, too, will be given what was lost to you. I promise. But in the meantime, live, my darling babies. Live a life worth living. Live thoroughly and completely, thoughtfully, gratefully, courageously, and wisely. Live!\n\nI love you both forever and ever, to infinity, through space and time. Never ever forget that.\n\nIf you haven’t already done so, subscribe to this newsletter so I can send it straight to your inbox, and please consider supporting it for a few pounds a month so I can spend even more time sending even more interesting emails to you.

Read the full essay here , and read Bianca’s essay for Kernel issue 1 on edtech here .\n\n\"You'll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.\" — Steven Johnson, Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World\n\nAs a kid who grew up on the Internet, playing was a way of living. Play came in the form of creation; I remember spending hours telling stories online, whether it be through drawing fanart or roleplaying characters. It got to the point when my mother enforced a limit, worried that I was getting addicted to the computer. Now, I've found myself with an abundance of opportunities — exciting Web3 projects, international freelance gigs, a prestigious scholarship — thanks to being well-versed in design, art, and writing: skills that I primarily gained not through sitting in school, but through having fun online.\n\nAround me, I see kids growing up the same way. At one end, there are developers learning programming through creation games like Roblox and Minecraft. At another, there are artists cultivating their craft in fandom communities on Twitter and Discord. I believe that these kids aren't just making their own futures, but the world's as well; investor Chris Dixon says that these present-day hobbies will seed future industries . Today's youth will be tomorrow's innovators.\n\nSo why aren't these hobbies taken seriously? It's because schools are still seen as the main venue for a person's development. However, there's more to learning than what can be found in school. In this essay, I'll be talking about how environments encourage or block students' growth, how existing virtual spaces fit into this, and how a giant game could become the best classroom of all.\n\nOur environment is the invisible hand that shapes our behavior . In line with this, the best learning environments are enabling environments ; according to researcher Andy Matuschak, these significantly expand its participants’ capacity to do things they find meaningful and important. To do this, the activities they provide must directly serve an intrinsically meaningful purpose. When participants are fuelled by an intense personal connection to a subject, they'll naturally partake in effortful engagement, which naturally leads to deep understanding. These activities must also focus on action. Compare reading about a sport versus actually playing the sport: the level of immersion corresponds to the amount of proficiency one can gain in the skill. Overall, enabling environments empower participants in acting on their interests by creating opportunities for personal growth and highlighting bridges to opportunities for action based on that growth.\n\nSchools aspire to do this, but often fall short. This is because their primary purpose is knowledge/skill development , which isn't intrinsically meaningful on its own. Because of this, students depend on teachers not only for expertise but also for purpose (i.e. learning for the sake of passing the subject). This dependence hinders the cultivation of an intense personal connection, making it less likely for the students to develop a deep understanding of a subject. Meanwhile, well-designed software can create better enabling environments for youth because they empower them in pursuing their passions (e.g. expanding range of artistic expression, distributing to millions with zero marginal cost).\n\nGames are a prime example of this. Philosopher C. Thi Nguyen describes them as an art form shaping our agency: what we do, how we do it, why we do it. Game designers accomplish this by creating rules, constraints, and affordances that make up the form of agency that players inhabit. For instance, chess is designed to focus players on calculational thinking, while Civilization focuses players on political strategy. By restricting players to various practical mindsets, games teach them new ways of inhabiting their own agency — helping them become more free. After all, you can’t break the rules without learning about them first.\n\nMatuschak clarifies that most games aren't enabling environments. Even if they're effective at developing knowledge and skills, they rarely expand players' capacity in doing things they find meaningful and important, since the primary purpose of most games is to create an aesthetic/emotional experience. However, there are a few that do enable agency: Minecraft's creative mode enables serious creative expression, while the structured social environments of massively-multiplayer online games enable interpersonal connection and community formation. These types of games, alongside other types of well-designed software, are the new schools of today's youth.\n\nSo how do these virtual spaces serve as enabling environments for learners? The essay \"Video Games are the Future of Education\" offers several conclusions.\n\nOne, they give students the environment and tools to make discoveries themselves. This is because they provide space, time, and autonomy, which enables students to choose what they learn and how they learn it. Schools cannot provide this level of freedom. That's why kids remember what they encounter through engaging in these spaces, and forget what is taught to them in classes. They need to feel like it's just play.\n\nTwo, these spaces provide a deep understanding of subjects. This is because they simulate reality and provide fast feedback loops, thanks to innovative features like immersive environments and real-time communication. Outputs are tangible to students, and directly related to the skills they learn (e.g. Git repositories for code, published pieces for art). Students also receive more realistic responses to their work (e.g. comments, metrics). Compare this to the typical school experience, which is quite shallow; when you're focused on memorizing information just to pass exams, you don't have the capacity to dive deep into a topic.\n\nIn short, virtual spaces can be optimal learning environments because they provide additional context and creative freedom. Aside from this, they bring together people with diverse ideas and interests since there are no barriers of physical location. This allows for a more equitable and effective distribution of knowledge, skills, and information.\n\nHowever, these spaces are still capable of exploiting or underserving youth, just like in traditional education.\n\nFor instance, real life inequality is elevated due to the digital divide. Those who can't rely on their own devices or connectivity won't be able to benefit from these spaces as much as people who can. Even worse, these spaces can also bar people financially. In many MMO games, the premium experience (i.e. exclusive items, more user privileges) is reserved for those who can afford a membership. Free members can't get these unless they work for it (a.k.a. putting in more time for less pay).\n\nOne benefit these spaces bring is that they show youth that they can find professional success with their talents by bringing them practical experience that is difficult to get in school. We see artists earning from their own merchandise and commissions and developers getting thousands of players for their games. However, most creators don't get to fully benefit from their work, since the majority of profit goes to the platforms.\n\nFor example: Roblox’s model makes it challenging for game developers to make money from their creations . Developers only get a 25 percent cut of revenue, which is one third of the industry standard. If they want to take out their earnings, they must have a premium subscription ($5 a month) and earn a minimum of 100,000 Robux. Artists are also at the mercy of social media platforms. Feed algorithms value frequency of posting over the time and effort art takes. Consequently, artists’ careers are being defined by the number of followers and positive reactions they get. This pressures them to constantly create and market content for the sake of making a living.\n\nOverall, these conditions make it difficult for youth to derive value not just from these spaces, but from the work they produce in them. It's why many parents and guardians discourage their kids from spending time online; they see it as a waste of time and money, and are unable to see how it could be beneficial long-term. Yet imagine how much youth would be empowered if these barriers to participation were removed. How can we tackle these problems? It's time to get creative.\n\nI believe that youth learn best when they feel like they're engaging in play; after all, we humans are Homo Ludens — born players. But I don't necessarily just mean playing video games. I'm talking about the games we play in life. According to writer James Carse , there are two types of games: finite, which is played for the purpose of winning, and infinite, which is played for the purpose of continuing play. Even if infinite games are best for learning, most of our educational environments are designed as finite games. Offline, we're optimizing for name-brand schools and 4.0 GPAs; online, we're grinding to top leaderboards and increase our reach. After spending all our youth playing in point systems, we end up valuing product (earning) over process (learning). So what if we approached education as an infinite game?\n\nThe Internet already serves as the venue for the biggest infinite game ever: The Great Online Game . Coined by investor Packy McCormick, this is a game where you play as yourself, racking up points, skills, and attributes that can be applied to your online and offline lives. Leveling up here is simple: the more you provide value (without expecting anything in return), the more you'll be rewarded. The best part is that anyone can play this game; it's nearly free to play, and leveling up is easier since your financial and social capital isn't tightly tied to real life credentials and connections. Playing this game is the ultimate way to experience learning by doing.\n\nPeople have always learned this way, but the Internet has given this approach the spotlight it deserves. We've arrived at an age of embedded education , where learning happens everywhere instead of being limited to individual platforms. Now, people are learning through encounters they have in systems that may have been created for non-educational purposes. On one hand, it looks like teenage girls learning about HTML/CSS and feminism on Tumblr; on the other, it looks like productivity nerds creating resources and tutorials for Notion.\n\nHowever, the current web isn't designed for the new ways we're learning. Standard online educational platforms like Canvas, Coursera, and Youtube see learning as consuming content; they don’t explicitly show how knowledge can be applied in actual context. This must change. In the future, I believe that the future of education will look like an infinite game that rewards learning by doing. This meta-game might be composed of multiple sub-games, where learning takes many forms: going to events (e.g. lectures, workshops, panels), creating insightful content, taking on job experiences, and working on side projects. Thus, everyone becomes a lifelong student; why would you want to stop learning when there are so many opportunities for it?\n\nI see this vision taking the form of a Metaverse powered by Web3 because of its potential for embedding education seamlessly into our lives. Stated well by investor Tina He: \"If the purpose of education is to inspire courage to expand our collective understanding of the world, the vision of Embedded Education is that every time we see something that inspires us, the path to actualizing this new-found dream starts right where we find it.\"\n\nThis was an excerpt — find out how Bianca substantiates this vision in the rest of this essay here :\n\nBianca Aguilar (she/her) is a designer, artist, and educator from Manila, Philippines.

is proficiency - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/consistency-is-proficiency?s=r","content":"For years I felt stuck in a holding pattern, unable to make meaningful progress. I always had a clear sense of what I was interested in, but the actual next steps were opaque to me. I remember being in college and asking my poetry professor how I could improve my poetry. And he said he thought my poems were good. And I said… I didn’t know how to word it, but what I really wanted to say was that I knew they were okay, but I could feel such a delta between what I was making and what I wanted to make, and I wanted to know how I could close that gap. And I guess what I understand now is that no one can really tell you that. The most important thing I’ve learned since then is that consistency is proficiency—only you can teach yourself what you need to know. I just kept trying the same things over and over again, and eventually my life changed.\n\nThe tough thing is that consistency can feel like it’s not paying off for long stretches of time. You feel aimless, like you’re going nowhere. You’re not improving as fast as you like. I’m an impatient person, so when I encounter this I always think, shouldn’t I be doing something smarter? But it’s like kicking in a door or breaking a piñata: you have kind of just keep going until something breaks.\n\nI was reflecting recently that most of the ways I push myself are internal. Most of my life has been spent searching for a tone, a scene. My friend J described himself today as “looking for internal validation.” I loved that thought. I always felt so silly and unproductive because my friends were out doing such cool things in the world, and I was spending hours and hours, what, reading another book that I would never talk to anyone about? Writing in my little journal? But different people want to be good at different things. I always wanted to be a writer, and I wanted to be able to really understand people. Those were the two things I really valued way before I could admit to myself I valued them. Even if my effort wasn’t visible, it mattered.\n\nThere’s no way in other than hammering at the door. And it can take a lot of hammering: we have to be persistent in pursuit of what we want. That, too, is a part of being in the flow of things. (Is that a paradox, that non-doing involves doing? It makes sense to me.) Looking back, I always suffered from a kind of passivity born out of shame. What was I afraid of? Rejection, I guess. Being seen as afraid of “wanting something too much.” Now that seems silly.\n\nI’m searching for something with this Substack that I couldn’t even articulate when I first started writing it (I would crudely describe it as “self-expression”). But I feel myself zeroing in on it over time: the exact nature of the thing I’m trying to say. My promise to myself is that I will be consistent, no matter what.\n\nI believe now that practice is always the way in. But not all types of practice are equal. I think of it like meditation: you can’t just zone out. You have to be there, watching yourself, when you’re practicing. You have to pay attention to what you’re doing right and wrong.\n\nIf I could go back in time I would tell myself: the things you fear are not real. What is real is the words on the page. What is real is the people who love you. You don’t trust yourself because you don’t think you’re good enough. But consistency always comes before proficiency. The first step is identifying what you’re willing to do every day for the rest of your life.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Crypto Twitter has exacerbated this problem, as I’ve felt required to say something interesting or beneficial almost everyday this past three months. I think it’s time I take a break.\n\nBeing anon has its perks. Nobody (except for maybe a select handful) knows who you are or what you do in the real world. Sure, many of you know that I’m a college freshman and I’m (gasps, who knew!) nineteen - but nobody really knows me for me. Not even I don’t.\n\nI’m incredibly grateful for the magic internet money that’s been able to alter the course of my life. Without discovering Solana or Bganpunks months and months ago, maybe I’d have all A’s in my classes right now, struggling to find internships for the summer. This is no longer the case. I actually consider dropping out a lot, partially due to wanting to participate in crypto full-time and also due to the fact I’m pretty bad at being a STEM major. Maybe I’ll figure things out one day. I haven’t even had to use my resume once in crypto, but that’s a topic for another day - just another perk of being anonymous.\n\nIt’s been really fun meeting a lot of you online. Sure, there are some dickheads here and there but it isn’t really an issue or something that makes me lose sleep - I don’t get enough of it to toss and turn in bed at night in the first place. I’ve made a ton of friends and have been able to have some seriously life changing opportunities given to me in such a short amount of time. I’ll spare you of any shoutouts, but mostly because I don’t feel like copying down a million different Twitter usernames right now.\n\nBeing able to write for an audience has always been a goal of mine. I’d spend a lot of time in high school trying to write fun articles for the school newspaper, but didn’t really catch onto the fact that nobody actually reads the school newspaper. No big deal, I have a substack now. As my articles gathered more attention, my twitter gained more followers than I knew what to do with. Thankfully I never tweet anything stupid, only ramblings, Apple Music screenshots and the occasional “alpha” tweet.\n\nIt’s been fun. At this point, I’m just not sure what direction to go with my Twitter. Being anon is great because you start with a blank slate and are given the opportunity to be anyone you want to. You can larp as a trader juggling 9 figures or you can larp as the next 100x dev that’s going to build Tesla on-chain. The opportunities are really endless, and you can take this as far as you wish.\n\nFor me, I don’t really have a niche. I liked DeFi a lot at the start because it made sense. Curve Wars, on-chain options protocols, anon mega-millionaires and billionaires fighting against each other whilst operating under pepe PFPs and god only knows what else. This was all very easily crafted into stories and informative articles that I enjoyed writing about. Now, I’m just not so sure anymore.\n\nI feel like I need a break from crypto, but at the same time, I feel that I should be spending all my time studying docs to dig up the next big narrative (which will never come, by the way) in order to become better versed in the technicals. Whatever it is that I need to do, I know it can’t be done in college. I love to write and it’s probably the only thing I’ve ever been sure about doing. If I can write about crypto and make a living that way, then I will do my best to make it happen.\n\nI want to be the best at what I do. I’ve become disappointed in myself lately after seeing how many good writers are out here beating me in the substackooooor game. I think it’s time to double down and take a hiatus. From there, I’ll come back better informed and stronger than ever. I can’t call myself “Knower” in good faith if I’ve begun to doubt the breadth of my own knowledge and means of obtaining it.\n\nIf I could finish off this semester for every cent to my name, I would. The only thing I’m looking forward to is being done with my first year of college, getting back home and of course, getting back to work on crypto with nothing else to bother me. I have made some mistakes along the way - I spread myself too thin and believed that I could do anything if I put my mind to it. This strategy only works for about a month or so, then you begin to realize how difficult it can be juggling every aspect of your life on 4-5 hours of sleep a night while trying to be some kind of DeFi superhero that knows everything going on in all corners of CT. It’s tiring.\n\nMaybe I need a nice 48-hour nap, a back massage and a long drive with the windows down. Who knows.\n\nBut I do know in my heart that it’s time to focus on what I want to achieve in life and how I wish to go about getting there. If this means taking a break from twitter to amass more knowledge, so be it. The app isn’t as fun when you’re mostly in stables, anyways.\n\nI’m incrdibly grateful for having the platform I do - my only wish is I could provide quality content as often as possible. I have high hopes this day will come soon. Until then, you can always DM me on twittah dot com or shoot me a message on telegram.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

In college studying computer science, creating software was always framed from a perspective of efficiency, generalizability, and scalability. We needed to find ways to make algorithms that could run fast enough, components that could easily compose, systems that would be sustainable in the long-term. We created systems that were good at what they did, but we didn't go beyond their actual ability to function to think about what they could be good at doing. The result is billion dollar companies and thousands of very valued startups that are built on marvelous engineering systems but have questionable secondary effects or actually don't help people do what they want to do (or sometimes even what the creators intended for them to do).\n\nMaybe because of this, I never really got poetry growing up. I didn't understand its purpose. Sometimes it rhymed and sometimes it didn't. Sometimes they followed proper grammar and sometimes they didn't. Sometimes they invented new words and other times, they used the same words in new ways. As opposed to one of these engineering systems I was familiar with, which was designed to be provably \"good,\" poems had no \"proof\" for their goodness; often, they were inherently illegible.\n\nI became intrigued by poetry again at the end of last year. I started getting poetic exposure through more poetic and rhythmic prose, and I really loved how poems could capture so much specific and intense feeling in such a small amount of space. I worked through The Best American Poetry 2021 anthology and from some of those works, experienced the wonder of mystery for the first time. Mystery had always felt negative to me. I was uncomfortable with not knowing, with the ambiguity of meaning. I liked black-and-white things. I craved total understanding, relying on analyses of analyses of analyses to make my decisions large and small. Reading some of these poems, I experienced how uncertainty can be beautiful. I saw how questions without answers could mark a heart.\n\nAlong with reading more poetry and writing more poetry, I wanted to see if I could merge the composable, efficient systems of software with the enigmatic and playful and boundless verses of poetry.\n\nIn that vein, I've worked on a few software poetics that I want to share with y'all :)\n\nI worked on this with kelsey as a submission for the 8th issue of taper , a computational poetry magazine. The idea is a subversion of the classic pacman, where instead of eating food, the player eats words to make their own poem. The words come from a very limited word bank, but because they are curated to be multipurpose, the limited word set and constraints of movement on the grid provide a lot of fun playability. I'm really interested in how constraints can enable creativity, especially with writing (which Matthew has and is doing great work looking into).\n\nA small version of it has been accepted (the limit is a 2kb HTML file), but I made a full version available on my website, where you have a history of all the games you've made and the ability to submit to a public gallery. It currently just goes into this coda doc, but I'm thinking of using this as an experiment to use coda as a database, which basically acts as a hosted version of baked data architecture , a concept of using a static file as your database for ease of use and modification.\n\nOne of the poems that really resonated from the 2021 Best American poetry anthology was \"Love\" by Alex Dimitrov . It turns out he has a separate Twitter account where he continually writes this poem, one line at a time (and a new one called loneliness ).\n\nI built the Twitter Pack for Coda recently (an integration that lets you live-sync data from Twitter into Coda, where you can take action on it), and I thought this was a great way to show how you can combine poetics with the composability of software. Bringing Twitter data into Coda allows me to leverage these general building blocks that Coda provides, which enables me to make a randomizer for lines of these poems (and color code which poem it's coming from).\n\nThis is an expansion of the telescopic text open-source library I worked on with Jacky . This is a poem gallery for the verses community and broader (an open submission form!) that shows off how you can make interactive, transforming poems with the library. It also includes a playground for creating your own from plain text (nested bullet points).\n\nI would love to see what y'all create :) Give it a try and let me know what you think! It also produces live code that you can copy + paste into your website to enable it.\n\nSome link gifts from this week that have particularly made an impact on me...\n\nA letter from a dying mother to her daughters with the advice to \"live a life worth living\"\n\nthe concept of idea machines as a means of influence\n\nand finally, one of my recent poems... first one i'm sharing publicly, so I'd love to hear thoughts :)\n\nAs always, I hope you are living life to the fullest and being honest to yourself, Spencer\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

I end up at Jane Street writing software to calculate numeric integrals of a function that is costly to evaluate. (They don’t tell me what the function is—it’s too secret for interns.)\n\nAfter two weeks, I come up with some of my own tweaks that make the algorithm work a bit better. I happily add “built a state-of-the-art library for numerical integration, with novel improvements on the best techniques in the academic literature” to my resume.\n\nBack to campus—time to declare a major. I’m falling asleep in all my lectures, except the math ones, which use enough jargon that I am confused instead of bored. Guess it’s math then. After declaring, I finally get assigned an adviser who doesn’t tell me to take easier courses.\n\nReal world, 2014—Math classes haven’t saved me from getting bored of college . I decide to take senior year off to work for a sexy machine learning startup. I spend months reading papers and optimizing our models. Our company doesn’t grow because we can’t close sales. (We have three engineers and no sales person.)\n\nReal world, 2015—My classmates have graduated and gone to math grad school or Google or Facebook. I’ve switched from earning to give to directly trying to improve the world, at Wave .\n\nWave is saving immigrants a lot of money. Unfortunately, we’re also saving a lot of money for fraudsters, who are using us to charge other people’s debit cards. I spend three hours building a trigram logistic regression that differentiates Kenyan names (real users) from non-Kenyan names (likely fraudsters), which puts a lid on our fraud for the next year.\n\nReal world, 2016—Wave’s new second-biggest problem is that we have outgrown Quickbooks. Our biggest problem is that the accountant-cum-engineer we hired to fix this is not good at either.\n\nI’m left holding the bag, closing our 2015 books with a god-awful combination of raw Postgres queries and janky half-baked Twitter Bootstrap UIs. I spend 20 hours a week on the phone with our auditors, explaining our terrible decisions. Somehow, improbably, I am not bored.\n\nFor some reason, a lot of smart college students end up with the idea that “solving hard technical problems” is the best thing they can do with their life. It’s a common refrain in Hacker News comments , job ads and interview questions .\n\nWhy does this happen? Probably because that’s the only thing they’ve been rewarded for over the past 15 years.\n\nSchool is a closed-world domain—you are solving crisply-defined puzzles (multiply these two numbers, implement this algorithm, write a book report by this rubric), your solution is evaluated on one dimension (letter grade), and the performance ceiling (an A+) is low. The only form of progression is to take harder courses. If you try to maximize your rewards under this reward function, you’ll end up looking for trickier and trickier puzzles that you can get an A+ on.\n\nThe real world is the polar opposite. You’ll have some ultra-vague end goal, like “help people in sub-Saharan Africa solve their money problems,” based on which you’ll need to prioritize many different sub-problems. A solution’s performance has many different dimensions (speed, reliability, usability, repeatability, cost, …)—you probably don’t even know what all the dimensions are, let alone which are the most important. The range of plausible outcomes covers orders of magnitude and the ceiling is saving billions of lives . The habits you learn by working on problem sets won’t help you here.\n\nBecause of these differences, most graduates of elite schools—including me—start out being completely unable to identify which work is actually important. (And if some important work does happen to hit us over the head, it won’t come in the form of a puzzle with a grading rubric, so we won’t know how to execute it well.) Instead, we’ll keep trying to run our college playbook, and look for hard problems.\n\nWhen I first graduated, I was afraid that if I worked with boring technology , I’d get bored. Instead, I learned it was possible—and fun—to optimize on other dimensions, or play a different game. Rather than competing for an A+ on a hard problem, I could try to solve an easy problem as quickly as possible (like Wave’s accounting), or find the easiest problem whose solution would be useful (like identifying Kenyan names), or hire a team to solve easy problems faster than I ever could myself.\n\nIn fact, these turned out to be even more interesting! Why? Because “hard technical problems” wasn’t my root goal—my root goal was to use my skills to get the most possible leverage on improving the world .\n\nIn school, if you pick an easy problem instead of a hard one, you lose leverage because your extra problem-solving ability goes to waste. But in real life, you can redirect it to prioritizing which problems to solve, or working more quickly, or building a machine that solves the problems for you.\n\nBecause of that, I’m confident that my ability to solve “hard problems” has translated into having way more impact on the lives of people in sub-Saharan Africa, even though there’s a sense in which “all I’m doing” is helping build a CRUD app.\n\nI won’t claim that the returns to intelligence are literally equal everywhere. But given a hairy enough goal, they’re a lot more evenly distributed than you think. So don’t look for hard problems—important ones are ultimately more fun!\n\nThanks to Eve Bigaj, Alexey Guzey, Jeff Kaufman, Dan Luu, Lincoln Quirk, and Yuri Vishnevsky for reading a draft of this post.

African Lives Matter in Responsible AI Discourse. - Paradigm Initiative","link":"https://paradigmhq.org/algorithmic-apartheid-african-lives-matter-in-responsible-ai-discourse","content":"News\n\nMay 21\n\n2021\n\nBy\n\n||\n\n||\n\n||\n\nAlgorithmic Apartheid? African Lives Matter in Responsible AI Discourse.\n\nWhat happens when machines are not given enough data to learn and accurately represent those on the African continent?\n\nScholarship is on a rise revealing rampant racism in decision-making software. Algorithms are used to assist institutions and big tech companies in recruitment processes, healthcare, to determine people’s creditworthiness and maintain protection online through various community standards and policies.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming lives all over the world. While such digital transformation is taking centre stage in digital rights debates, researchers argue that algorithmic systems can lead to biased decisions , with the encoding of existing human biases into machine learning being the most significant underlying cause.\n\nComputer scientist and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL) , Joy Boulamwini says there needs to be a choice, right now in the digital sphere. “What’s happening is these technologies are being deployed widely without oversight, oftentimes covertly, so that by the time we wake up, it’s almost too late”, she echoed. Therefore, questions of representation are central in data and algorithm ethic discourse, and rightfully so, because machines mirror society’s behaviour.\n\nWith such arguments at the fore, it becomes clear that previously marginalised communities are more inclined to experience algorithmic biases. Africans continue to face discrimination offline in various sectors and should machines continue to consume and process biased data, eliminating existing inequalities could become an even harder challenge. Therefore, the time to start dissecting data and algorithm biases in Africa is now and digital rights activists need to prioritise this.\n\nAlgorithms are simply defined as a process or set of rules to be followed. They aim to solve problems and make our lives easier. Everything we do in our daily lives, to an extent, follows an algorithm; from waking up to having breakfast and sleeping. Our lives are designed to follow certain patterns or rules and the same happens in machine learning. In AI, algorithms can be any form of automated instructions.\n\nBig tech companies use a process called Machine Learning (ML) to teach Artificial Intelligence (AI) certain patterns about the society they are to ‘serve’. Quinyx’s Berend Berendsen, defines ML as a set of algorithms that are fed with structured data in order to complete a task.\n\nAlgorithms are constantly trained by feeding them data, such as biometrics (facial recognition, finger prints, iris, voice etc), typing patterns, personal information such as dates of birth, users’ behaviour online etc. IBM says that through the use of statistical methods, they train algorithms to make classifications or predictions, and uncover key insights within data mining projects.\n\nPlatforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Tiktok and Instagram not only use such algorithms to ‘tailor’ individual users’ content, they also use algorithms to design and determine their community standards and policies. However, for this to fully function, machines need to be provided with ample data.\n\nAI ethicists argue that most algorithms do not represent the contexts that we live in, for example, it is harder for them to recognise black people. Even though AI captures preferences and mimics human behaviour, such systems can inherit human biases. Therefore, algorithm developers should not only place emphasis on the technological design, but closely monitor how data is prepared and processed. It is not about feeding machines with big data. If the data is inaccurate, unjust or unrepresentative, biased behaviours perpetuated through the black box will discriminate against millions of people in Africa.\n\nIn their book, Costs of Connection: How Data is Colonizing Human Life and Appropriating It for Capitalism, scholars Nick Couldry and Ulises A. Mejias, refer to this as a newer form of digital land grabbing. “The acquisition and construction of data for corporate use, that’s the land grabbing going on” says Couldry. Further hinting that colonialism is the only word that can describe how big tech companies are utilising people’s data.\n\nColonialism is not a new concept in Africa and people who already form part of previously marginalised communities risk being enveloped and trapped in emerging AI apartheid systems. This is already visible through various platforms. For example, Africa has an estimated population of over 1.3 billion people and 54 countries with most living in internet deserts. Although most countries in Africa either speak English, French, Spanish or Portuguese, Africa is home to over 2 000 languages.\n\nThe question, however, that should begin to concern digital activists on the continent should be: with such diversity in Africa, whose knowledge is represented and how is it disseminated through AI?\n\nVoice-based interfaces like Google’s ‘ Hey Google’, Amazon’s ‘ Alexa’ and other virtual assistants are taught various languages. Currently, iOS’s ‘Siri’ speaks nine different English accents with the main ones being American, Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and ‘South African’. Facebook currently uses AI to proactively detect hate speech in 40 languages , however, most voice assistants do not support African languages . Language inequalities risk excluding certain members of society.\n\nIf we reinforce the wrong kind of machine learning, then we bolster past and current societal biases. Geographical biases in AI can harm those in the global south and we need to constantly ask; who is teaching machines and what type of knowledge is dominant?\n\nAI is serving as a gatekeeper when it comes to accessing healthcare, hiring processes and predictive policing. Much of what is fed to machines about black people, however, is from specific geographical areas. Data that currently teaches machines on subjects of representation might not be as inclusive and just as we would like it to be. Machines are taught by humans and sadly potential biases embedded in society make their way into decision-making software.\n\nAlgorithms don’t follow rules, they follow patterns. With facial recognition for example, misidentification is common as original AI-designed models are often white and male . Humans are not designed to fit it into one model and this sector needs to be simplified. Researchers have proposed algorithmic audits as one method that can reduce biases.\n\nIn a research paper titled, Closing the AI Accountability Gap: Defining an End-to-End Framework for Internal Algorithmic Auditing, researchers propose that these audits should serve “as a mechanism to check that the engineering processes involved in AI system creation and deployment meet declared ethical expectations and standards, such as organizational AI principles”.\n\nPerhaps now is the time for African governments to start discussing and implementing frameworks that deal with algorithmic auditing. Additionally, in order to fully tackle algorithmic biases, users need to be educated on how their data is processed and how machines translate and utilise them.\n\nThose of us on the African continent are not just users. Our data is providing big tech companies with insights into our behavioural patterns.

Everything has gravity to it. There are some small choices you make that take your hand and lead you forward into your entire life. These are unexpected, rare, special moments.\n\nTruthfully, life is just a tenuous combination of conscious and implicit choices. What you omit is as important as what you say. What you don’t choose is as important as what you do. Melissa Febos wrote in Body Work: I want to be awake for all my choices. But most of the time we make choices half-asleep, half-conscious. It’s so hard to be awake, to pay attention to all of it. The mind can’t bear too many decisions. That’s why it goes on autopilot so often: chooses the easiest route. The one with least conflict, least vulnerability, least risk.\n\nBeing awake is realizing you are making mini choices all the time, it’s whether you notice them or not.\n\nExample: on the micro scale today I’m choosing between my phone lighting up in the corner, the books I’ve yet to read, focused work, deep rest. I choose to sit here for 3 hours and write today. To run through Golden Gate Park until my lungs start to burn. To feel the ache, the loosening, the euphoria. To see the world one shade greener. To observe how tender, benevolent it all feels when I look closely.\n\nHow you choose to approach the world shapes your entire experience living in it. Maybe that’s what we love about meditation — it shows us that what we pay attention to is a decision in itself.\n\nOf course there are some selections that are clearly consequential. Where to live, who to commit to, how to see ourselves. Six months ago, I wrote about choosing to move to SF (at an earlier point I was debating moving to a different city for someone important in my life)\n\nHayao Miyazaki: To exist here, now, means to lose the possibility of being countless other potential selves. I think about this all the time: how the self I am now is different from all my other potential selves just by virtue of being physically here and not anywhere else. There are consequences to that decision, but again, choosing is the hardest part. After that, you learn to love it. As they say: “wherever you go, there you are.\" That quote is meant to come from Confucius but the actual Mandarin translation ends up being “wherever you go, go with all your heart.\" Either way you read it is pretty beautiful.\n\nThat post was about a medium-sized decision to move SF, but it was really about how I deeply believe in owning your decisions and moving with lightness (going with all your heart). To know you made a choice for yourself. Even if it means leaving an imagined self behind, even if it means grieving the ‘potential self’ in order to make room for the present one. No nostalgia, no expectation.\n\nWriting that piece also cemented for me that the purest form of love is giving someone space to make their own decisions.\n\nNo godly intervention, no ‘well-intentioned’ directions, no shaming. Even if the choice is different from one you would have made. Even if it feels like a punch to the heart.\n\n“My job is to observe people” Murakami wrote, “and not to judge them.” I think that’s the job of love too. Love is all about choice, I’ve realized. Because choice is about freedom. And when you restrict someone’s freedom, you also restrict their soul.\n\nYou see, there are infinite worlds in which different combinations of our choices lead to different outcomes. There are worlds in which you and I never meet. Worlds in which you mean everything to me. And too many choices in this lifetime to be able to act on them all.\n\nI've realized the best I can do is try to stay awake: to see beauty in serendipity. To appreciate how the self continuously evolves through decisions. To choose things that make me feel bright, full, and clear. Each choice, big or small, reveals a little more of me to myself. I just have to pay attention.\n\nA closed door is always secondary to the prayer you say in front of it . Go back to your prayer instead. Ask what’s in your prayer.

The next, you were too scared to leave your home. Back then, you danced wildly in a mass of glitter and neon spandex. Now, you haven't seen your friends or family in months. For all of us, the pandemic has dialed the speed and scale of daily life way, way down.\n\nAnd what have you done with all this newfound time?\n\nYou read the news. You hate-read the news. Everything fucking sucks, so you download TikTok. You miss your friends. You attend a \"Zoom Happy Hour\" to play skribble.io and whiteboard Hangman. Your eyes hurt. You start a journal. You launch a Substack. You reminisce about your mom's cooking. You feel guilty about not knowing what goes into 麻婆豆腐, so you give her a call. You buy too many plants.

As cases climbed, the central government failed over and over to provide a response plan.\n\nWithout Amazon, you walk to the corner store. Without national policy, you start listening to your mayor. With the world on fire, you start turning in.\n\nContrast McLuhan to a quote from Rachel, 19, a self-described \"cottagecore teen\" interviewed in Paper Mag:\n\nI define [cottagecore] as an aesthetic as well as a lifestyle. It's like an escape to another time or a fantasy world where things aren't as complicated, and it's just you and the bugs and the breeze and your pretty dress.\n\nI define [cottagecore] as an aesthetic as well as a lifestyle.

It's like an escape to another time or a fantasy world where things aren't as complicated, and it's just you and the bugs and the breeze and your pretty dress.\n\nI spent the month of July holed up in Camano, Washington, a rural island an hour north of Seattle. Since I hadn't started work yet, I would cook three meals a day and spend lazy afternoons reading on the lawn, accompanied by homemade cold brew and a gorgeous, sparkling view of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nI often took walks on a short trail off the main road around the island. The trail was dotted with wild berry bushes—red huckleberry, trailing blackberry, thimbleberry, salal—which I packed into Tupperwares to take home and make into jam. There were bugs, too, which I was absolutely terrified of until I learned their names: seven-spotted lady beetle, carpenter ant, yellow-faced bumble bee.\n\nScale enabled us to march for Black lives and organize online. Scale brought movements around the world into a single scroll: Hong Kong, Lebanon, Belarus. But scale also taught us to get local: to look up our city's bail fund, petition our old high school, talk politics with our parents.\n\nIn particular, the mutual aid funds that popped up in response to COVID-19 exemplified the best, most hopeful parts of digital organizing. When Stanford suddenly announced layoffs for its contracted custodial staff, the organization Students for Workers' Rights immediately began to petition the university, hold Zoom concert fundraisers, and set up emergency funds for impacted workers. In an op-ed for The Stanford Daily, student-activist Ethan Chua writes :\n\nFor Students for Workers’ Rights, mutual aid is a critique of the present. If we’re living in a dystopia generated by late capitalism, mutual aid is an enactment of an alternative way of life, one where interdependence and collective care are valued over accumulation and commodification.\n\nFor Students for Workers’ Rights, mutual aid is a critique of the present.

A Venmo fund is set up to pay for next week's rent.\n\nGoodreads.com is a horrible website. Every action by someone you follow appears as a block on your homepage, including every new friend or book that a user adds. Book reviews are styled in HTML, requiring you to type bracket-slash-i-bracket to close every italicized phrase. My books get auto-marked 'Finished' before I've read halfway. There's no way to say you abandoned one two chapters in. Among the 150 friends I have on the platform, I'd wager that around 10 percent are active users. Also, the site background is beige.\n\nBut I love Goodreads. It makes me happy when someone likes a review I've written, and happy when I find a new favorite off a friend's digital shelf. It's easy to imagine myself and my 15 friends in an tiny old library with ratty carpet and ugly beige wallpaper. Some of us roam the shelves, recommending books across aisles; others sink into armchairs, ensconced in a story.\n\nEven smaller than Goodreads—which I admit is still owned by Amazon, however kitschy the vibes—you get the personal projects that were never meant to scale. I'm reminded of Robin Sloan's blog post , \"An app can be a home-cooked meal.\" The post is an endearing account of BoopSnoop, the messaging app he built just for his family:\n\nThis messaging app I built for, and with, my family, it won’t change unless we want it to change.

and Belonging - by Simon Sarris","link":"https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/familiarity-and-belonging?s=r","content":"Familiarity and Belonging\n\n“Men did not love Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.” — G.K. Chesterton\n\nA short story: The princess kisses a frog, and creates the prince.\n\nOver time several thoughts of the same cloth have come to me:\n\n~ Reading is good, re-reading is sublime. I am always surprised when re-reading my favorite books at just how much more there is the second time.\n\n~ Revisiting the same mountain trail ten times is more illuminating than hiking ten different mountains. The feeling that dawns on you once a trail is well-known has no substitute. Here is a view of Mount Lafayette, from Little Haystack, a hike along the Franconia ridge I have done enough that familiarity alone carries me across the peaks.\n\n~ To travel the world visiting everywhere only once can hardly bring understanding. You must return several times before a place opens up to you. Returning to the same place brings a new set of emotions, and eventually, some familiarity.\n\nSo it is with many many other things. More than I think we realize at first.\n\nFamiliarity is a misunderstood virtue. Cultivating a sense of belonging is under-practiced. No matter where you live it is worth trying to improve the small things of your world. Romanticism has always elevated the pleasure of adventure over the pleasure of belonging, to an almost comical degree in recent times—everyone’s favorite hobby just so happens to be “travel”. I think this is something of an oversight. (I am not against travel: I think seeing the world is a great hobby, but it’s one that you should try at home, too.)\n\n(And this is not a post about staying put forever. You should pursue opportunity and leverage yourself wherever you can. But wherever you settle should also be a place you come to care about, and not a transitory thing. Places, institutions, and families are the things that may outlive us, we should build them whenever we can. Love and effort turn them into their glorious forms, like the princess and her frog.)\n\nDo we find it difficult to cultivate familiarity these days? There is a Twitter joke:\n\nIt’s true, but why? I think the paradox is explained simply: hanging out, catching up, etc, are inadequate because they are too big. Familiarity is crucially the maintaining of weak ties, or else the maintaining of strong ties in weak ways. Some things can only be made strong by binding one thousand tiny threads. So the problem isn’t that friends must hang out more, the problem is that they haven’t seen each other in forever (without hanging out). What creates strong friendships are repeated, tiny, and unplanned interactions.\n\nUnfortunately for some of us, these ties are harmed by the modern environment of cars: Driving point-to-point means we will never bump into people along the way (though we might at the destination). The same happens as we order more of our everyday lives online. We cannot have as many of these small interactions because we simply dwell in fewer places than we did 100 years ago. The family friendly pub and the association club fell prey to watching a screen. (TV is so pernicious because it asks for nothing from you, except all of the time you’ve got to spare. You might not even notice that you’ve lost something. Did we sleepwalk into bowling alone simply out of a scheduling conflict?)\n\nOne way to gain these interactions is to do them consciously, like going to a cafe every single day. This is expensive if you treat it as a coffee habit, but very cheap if you understand that it is buy-in for one of the few accessible spheres of public life. I have met a hundred people by simply going to a cafes every day until the people became familiar, including my wife (and the shop owners, the mayor, roommates, a sculptor, enough friends to make a liquor tasting group, etc).\n\nNote please, some people go to cafes to expressly meet people, and are aggressively friendly in trying to strike up conversations with everyone they see. If you understand me I hope it is clear that you should not do this. You should do almost the opposite! The thing that familiarity affords is not having to awkwardly reach out to people, but simply existing alongside them enough until it no longer becomes weird to interact. Having a sense of familiarity first is what removes the awkward desperation that’s endemic to things like dating sites and meetup groups, which are quite stifling in comparison. But if you go somewhere every single day, then after 100+ days, you start to recognize people, and they start to recognize you. Then you can talk about all kinds of stuff without the forced pretense, but there’s no simple substitute for that time spent.\n\nAside from cafes, how best to cultivate the familiarity of people? Where can we find the repetition required? Perhaps there’s no easy answer. But I think that the best way to build new relationships of every kind is to do work together. Start a project, join an association, work with the garage door up . Working on something together is probably a good date idea, too. As you come to know your work, you come to know the people. (by work I mean: you should find meaningful work to do outside of your job, if you want much of anything to follow.)\n\nBelonging: To belong is to possess a kind of irreplaceable familiarity. If you love your family, it is clearly not interchangeable with another family. When you love your home or city, or some club or cafe, you cannot swap for any other and feel the same.\n\nPeople seek meaningful places worthy of calling home. These can be found, adventure tells us, but belonging reminds us that with our own efforts they can (they must) be made. All worthy places were once unworthy, after all.\n\nA person may remodel a house, but stop short at only the things that increase its resale value. It is when he decides to make contributions that offer him no economic gains that he might open up the genius of the place. To love a place is to allow ourselves to contribute beyond expectations of material return. To dwell poetically is to live as if even a simple apartment was your home forever. Once you are able to cast off the feeling that wherever you are living is somehow temporary, wherever you are living will begin to feel like home. To do this requires a kind of love.\n\nThe princess kisses a frog, and creates the prince.\n\n(Hmm, that’s not quite all. There must be more to belonging. At the very least: Sometimes we can feel astonished by things in the world, and yet at home with them. Some things seem to offer both both fascination and comfort, like an impeccable garden, or a grandparent’s farmhouse that seems to house not only the territory and people but also a deep well of memories. There exists a certain kind of romanticism to be found even within the everyday belonging, though it often seems to hide from sight. Is it possible to cultivate this familiar mysticism of the world?)\n\nDid I set out to write what I was really thinking, when I began? I no longer remember.\n\nMy days lately have afforded only doing, not thinking or writing, but the sun is changing more and more.\n\nWrite to me soon,\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Thanks to Duncan Sabien and the LessWrong Feedback Service for valuable feedback!)\n\nThis post is about the concept of agency , which I define as ‘doing what is needed to achieve your goals’. As stated, this sounds pretty trivial - who wouldn’t do things to achieve their goals? But true agency is surprisingly hard and rare. Our lives are full of constraints, and defaults that we blindly follow, going past this to find a better way of achieving our goals is hard.\n\nAnd this is a massive tragedy, because agency is incredibly important. The world is full of wasted motion . Most things in both our lives and the world are inefficient and sub-optimal, and it often takes creativity, originality and effort to find better approaches. Just following default strategies can massively hold you back from achieving what you could achieve with better strategies.\n\nThis should not be surprising. Thinking past defaults, and your conception of ‘normal’ is hard, and takes meaningful effort. But this leaves a lot of value on the table! Personally, I’ve found cultivating agency to be one of the most useful ways I’ve grown over the last few years. And, crucially, this was deliberate - agency is a hard but trainable skill. In this post, I try to outline my models of what agency is, and my thoughts on how to cultivate it.\n\nI’ve been pretty abstract so far about the idea of agency. A reasonable reaction would be to be pretty skeptical that there’s any value here. That you already try to achieve your goals, that’s what it means to have goals! But I would argue that it’s easy to be missing out on opportunities and better strategies without realising it. An unofficial theme of this blog is that the world is full of low-hanging fruit , you just need to look for it. Further, many of the people I most admire, who’ve successfully changed the world for the better, had a lot of agency - changing the world is not the default path!\n\nTo make this more concrete, I want to focus on examples of how agency has been personally valuable to me. The times I managed to step off the default path, look past my constraints, and be more ambitious and creative about how I achieved my goals.\n\nBy far the most significant was realising that I could take agency with my career and life path. That I could step away from the default of continuing my undergrad to a fourth year and masters and then doing a maths PhD or working in finance. And instead, I’ve spent the past year doing 3 back-to-back AI Alignment research internships, trying to figure out if this might be a path for me to have a significant positive impact on the world.\n\nThis was an incredibly good decision that led to much more personal growth. I now feel much less risk-averse, am a better engineer and researcher, have a much clearer idea of what the AI space is like, and have a much more concrete view of why AI Alignment matters and what progress on it might look like.\n\nFurther, I now have a job I’m very excited about, and a much clearer picture of what I want to do over the next few years.\n\nAgency is relative to your context, and your defaults. I expect some people would have found this decision easy, but I found this surprisingly hard. I’d intended to do a fourth year for ages, and most of my friends were doing it - this strongly felt like the default, and doing something else felt risky and scary.\n\nBeing ambitious about taking on personal projects, rather than the default of being risk-averse and shying away from fear of failure and putting in effort\n\nStarting a blog ! Most notably, this led to my now-girlfriend asking me out, and being interviewed on a cool podcast .\n\nLearning how to learn - Being intentional about how I learn and publicly experimenting with new approaches. Organising my own lectures , publishing notes , and finding that my best way of learning is by teaching.\n\nRealising that I can improve my social life by taking initiative - breaking free of the default path of forming surface level friendships with the people I run into naturally, and never putting myself out there.\n\nIntentionally making close friends - practicing and learning how to form emotional bonds with friends has made my life so much better, and hopefully helped improve their’s too!\n\nTaking social initiative - By getting better at reaching out, I’ve gotten really valuable mentorship and advice, job opportunities, and friends I now cherish\n\nHaving awkward conversations about ways I thought I’d hurt someone or being hurt, apologising, and growing closer rather than letting things fester\n\nImproving myself and my life. Breaking out of the default mode of helplessness and realising that problems are for fixing , that I have the capacity to make things better.\n\nUnderlying my feelings of guilt, obligation and not meeting my standards , and learning how to manage this better\n\nUnderstanding my own motivation and learning how to become excited about what I’m doing, or how to find things I am excited about.\n\nSmaller everyday things - noticing small things which annoy me and fixing them, or items that could improve my life and buying them.\n\nMore generally, the spirit of self-experimentation, seeking novelty and doing new things, and being willing to go outside my comfort zone to see what that’s like. This has led to things from trying out pole-dancing to going round a room and asking people for sincere criticism.\n\nAs those examples hopefully illustrate, agency has been extremely valuable for me, and my goals. But it is not my place to tell you whether agency is right for you. Agency can be hard, stressful and exhausting! Sometimes the defaults are good enough. Instead, my goal in this post is to present the mindset of agency, and make a case that it can be valuable to you, for achieving what you want.\n\nExercise : What do you want? What are your goals? What are your dreams, your ambitions? How do you want to change the world? What is missing in your life? Take a minute to reflect on your favourite prompt before moving on.\n\nWhen stated as ‘doing what is needed to achieve your goals’, agency feels like a pretty simple concept. But implicitly, I’m gesturing at a messy bundle of different skills. In this section, I want to break agency down what agency is, and the most important mindset and sub-skills. These are neither comprehensive nor compulsory for achieving agency, but I’ve found all of them valuable to cultivate:\n\nNoticing and avoiding defaults: A core lens I view the world through is that our lives are full of defaults. Expectations that society places upon us, social norms that we follow, our own conception of our role and expected duties and path through life, our own conception of what is ‘normal’ vs ‘weird’. A key part of agency is noticing when these constrain you, and being willing to break them.\n\nPart of this is avoiding groupthink - being able to think non-default thoughts, think for yourself, think things through from first principles, and deeply caring about having true beliefs.\n\nEg the kind of person who was concerned about COVID at the start of February, or someone who grew up in a deeply religious household and decided to de-convert.\n\nNote that agency is not about knee-jerk nonconformity. You need to be willing to not conform - that’s what it means to avoid a default. But non-conformity fails to be agency when it’s about not following defaults because they’re defaults, rather than to achieve your goals - that’s still letting defaults control you. Instead, strive to notice your defaults, and check whether you want to avoid it.\n\nFor example, trying hard in exams is often the conformist choice. But if I care about getting a great job and my grades matter for that, then choosing to try hard is the agentic choice, and slacking off is not.\n\nFinding opportunities: Noticing when there are opportunities to achieve my goals, chances to take agency. And being good at making my own opportunities, and actively seeking them out, rather than waiting for them to fall into my lap\n\nPart of this is creativity - being able to see what other people don’t see, and generate a lot of ideas\n\nPart of this is not thinking in defaults - being open to weird and unusual ideas, and taking them seriously\n\nTo me, this feels similar to the mindset of learning the rules to a game, and reflexively looking for ways to exploit, munchkin and break them.\n\nIntentionality: Understanding why you’re taking actions, and keeping your goals clearly in mind. Being mindful of wasted motion , and checking whether you’re actually achieving what you want. Being deliberate .\n\nNote that this is separate from identifying your goals in the first place. Spending time thinking about and eliciting your deep goals and values, the skill of prioritisation , is incredibly important. But it different enough to be worth separating from agency, which is about building on those goals.\n\nThough this is a fuzzy boundary - we often absorb default goals from our social context, eg making money or seeking status. And it takes agency to look past this and check for what you actually value.\n\nTaking action: Ultimately agency is about doing things to achieve my goals. It is important to learn how to convert thoughts and vague intentions into actions and change.\n\nBut agency is not just about having willpower and putting in effort, being able to act rather than procrastinating or always following the easy path. Agency is also about being strategic and intentional. For example, a hard-working student who exerts a lot of effort to read and re-read their notes exhibits less agency than a student who learns it with half the effort by spaced repetition, or who realises they don’t care about this course and drop it.\n\nAmbition: Thinking big, and not being constrained by small-mindedness. Often you can achieve things far more important than it feels at first. We are bad judges of what we are capable of, and it is a tragedy to let a lack of ambition limit what you can achieve.\n\nThis can look like many things - being ambitious in changing your life, believing that you can make progress on your biggest problems rather than being helpless ; being ambitious as a researcher by identifying the most important problems in your field and working on them ; being ambitious about having a major positive impact and making progress on the world’s biggest problems, eg believing you might be able to save hundreds of millions of lives .\n\nAn underlying insight here is the importance of fat tails and upside risk\n\nThough note that agency is not just about ambition, it is also about being intentional. Agency looks like actually trying, not just doing actions that seem defensible under the pretext of some grand vision. Trying to understand the problem, finding the points of leverage, and forming a theory of change for how to achieve your ambition. Noticing when your strategies aren’t working, learning from this, and doing something differently.\n\nDon’t be a bystander : A particularly poisonous mindset that can hold you back from agency is the bystander effect. Saying that something is “not my problem”, implicitly relying on someone else to fix it. Asking whether you have to do something about it, rather than whether you want to, or whether doing it could bring you closer to your goals or help others. Framing things in terms of blame and obligation, rather than asking if you could do something about it..\n\nThis can be local, personal problems or larger problems in the world. From realising you can take agency and fix the things in your life that make you unhappy, like poor sleep, to contributing to large global challenges like climate change or pandemic prevention\n\nPart of this mindset is taking responsibility - realising that you can do things and influence the world, and that by taking it upon yourself to fix or improve something the world will be better than if you did nothing. That if you just rely on others, the world will be worse.\n\nPart of this mindset is to pick your battles - taking responsibility can itself be poisonous if you make everything your problem, every single thing that is wrong in the world and your life, and feel guilty if you fail to solve them. Focus on the problems you most care about and have leverage on.\n\nFurther, sometimes you will never be able to “solve” a problem. Making progress on a big problem can still be really valuable. And flinching away from problems so large they feel unsolvable can also hold you back.\n\nA final note after all this discussion of what agency is and isn’t. In practice, it is rarely sensible to ask “is this actually agenty enough?” and imagining being able to justify your agency - that pushes me towards doing things that are clearly and legibly weird and original. Instead, agency is relative to your goals, and your defaults. A socially anxious introvert who decides to throw a party demonstrates far more agency than a confident extrovert who does it every weekend. Agency is what you make of it. The important question is whether it helps you achieve your goals, not whether it looks appropriately brave or non-conformist.\n\nAn application of agency that is particularly important to me is taking agency in improving the world, in finding the most effective ways to have a positive impact. Agency is important here because you can do far more good than you do by following default ways to do good - I see this as one of the key insights I’ve gotten from the Effective Altruism movement. You can achieve far more if you look for missed opportunities, way to leverage your limited resources, ways to be far more ambitious and aim for a chance of having a major impact .\n\nThe mindset of taking responsibility for contributing to the world’s problems treating it as ‘not my problem’ can be particularly important here, and represent the difference between doing something and nothing. Eg, realising that you can actually put meaningful effort into fighting climate change, rather than just recycling and being environmentally conscious. But I think this mindset can harm people, so I wanted to give my take on how I view this.\n\nOften, this can be framed in terms of obligations. That the world is full of problems, it is my job to fix them, and I have to do this. I reject that mindset. You don’t have to do anything. If you don’t care about problems, that is your prerogative.\n\nInstead, I think in terms of my values. Over the course of my life, I have the capacity to influence the world towards my values, and it is my responsibility to do something about this. But this is not some weighty obligation to resent and feel guilty towards - these are my values and I actually care about doing something about it. Personally, I care deeply about human flourishing. I have the capacity to influence the world to be a better and safer place, and it is important to me to do something about this, to take agency and be ambitious about it. I’m a big fan of Nate Soares’ thoughts here.\n\nAgency can be pretty rare. And part of why it’s rare is that it’s hard! And in particular, lots of things make it harder to be an agent. And before diving how to develop agency, it’s worth examining what’s holding you back, and seeing which things you can relax. Even if you can’t solve the things holding you back, often just identifying them can help!\n\nThere are two important categories here, defaults and constraints .\n\nEg, that the role of a good student is to do well in assignment, so you pour all your effort into your degree, without checking how much you care\n\nThis is particularly bad with expectations around careers and life paths. This is one of the most important decisions you’ll ever make!\n\nEg, the idea that a maths student will go into software, finance or academia, and you just need to find the best option\n\nEg, having Asian parents who insist that you need to become a doctor or a lawyer\n\nSocial norms - a deep sense of what is “normal” vs “weird”\n\nEg, feeling unable to skip small talk and talk about something interesting, even if you think both of you would enjoy it\n\nOf course, often following social norms is the right call! But it’s valuable to see it as a trade-off, with benefits and consequences, rather than an iron-clad rule that induces anxiety to violate\n\nCultural narratives and groupthink - the ideas you’re taught when you’re young, and the things everyone around you believes\n\nPolitics is particularly bad for this - it’s very hard to hold right wing ideas if all your friends are left, and vice versa\n\nIt’s worth noting this even when you think you agree with the idea! Eg, I’d find it pretty hard to conclude that COVID vaccines aren’t worth taking given my social circles. I also genuinely think the vaccines are great, but it’s much harder to be truth-tracking here!\n\nDefault strategies - Instrumentally achieving your goals the way all your friends do. This is much worse with peer pressure, but even just a sense of what is “normal” can hold you back\n\nEg, learning by going to lectures, making notes, and revising by re-reading and doing past papers\n\nEg, letting keeping in touch with friends happen naturally and spontaneously, rather than being deliberate and intentional about it\n\nThe illusion of doing nothing - The feeling that doing nothing is safe, that you can’t be blamed, and that taking action is scary. And thus procrastinating on actually doing anything.\n\nThis is much worse when I’m considering doing something with risk!\n\nAnd when dealing with option paralysis\n\nConstraints - When you don’t have enough of some important resource, and feel constrained. Fundamentally, lacking Slack in your life.\n\nEnergy levels - it’s much harder to be agentic when you’re tired all the time!\n\nNote, if you commonly feel fatigued, I highly recommend getting tested for the most common causes of fatigue ! Some, like iron deficiency or hypothyroidism, are easy to treat and easy to test for but often go undiagnosed.\n\nThere can be more mundane causes - poor sleep, poor diet, lack of exercise, etc\n\nNote - it’s worth distinguishing between not having enough time, vs not being able to use time well. I find that when I’m stressed, I always feel like I don’t have enough time\n\nCommitments - overcommitting your time, having a packed schedule and a long list of obligations\n\nOn a deeper level, sometimes the problem is feeling unable to quit things, and not knowing how to say no when someone asks you to take on a new commitment.\n\nI’ve recently gotten value from making a form I need to fill out when taking on any new commitment, estimating how much time and effort it’ll take, and checking whether it’s actually worth it\n\nI’ve found Lorien Psychiatry’s advice super useful here (written by Scott Alexander), the article on depression is particularly good\n\nAttention/focus - are you constantly distracted? Do you ever have long blocks of at least 2 hours where you’re confident you won’t be interrupted, and can think and reflect on things?\n\nIt’s worth checking how much of the resource you actually need, and trying to quantify things. Or whether you can systematise taking care of it. Often the problem is less the constraint itself, and more the mental space tracking it and stressing over it takes up. Eg, it’s much better to make and keep to a budget than to constantly stress over how much money you spend.\n\nOf course, just noticing a default or constraint is much easier than solving it. So what can you do? This is hard to give general advice on, but often noticing is the first step to doing something about it. Some personal examples:\n\nI noticed the constraint of not having enough mental space to try new things or take agency, due to a lack of Slack and too many commitments. In the short term, I carved out my Sunday afternoons to relax and work towards non-urgent stuff, or whatever I was excited about, and carved out time for weekly reviews , to reflect on my longer-term goals and on what opportunities I was missing when too in the moment. In the longer-term, I’ve set myself a much higher bar for future commitments, quit the lowest priority ones, and am slowly reducing my load.\n\nI noticed that I cared a lot about what felt normal and safe, vs weird and unusual, and found it took a lot of willpower to deviate from this. In the short term, I found particularly useful kinds of weird things to do, and practiced doing them. In the longer-term, I’ve tried to surround myself with friends who are ambitious, altruistic and agentic, and I am sufficiently socially influenced that this has helped me get better at overcoming defaults in general.\n\nExercise: What’s stopping you? If you suddenly became significantly more ambitious, what would you want to do? And what’s holding you back from doing that now?\n\nThe main path to cultivating agency, as I see it, is to practice! To initially do agentic things occasionally, and with effort. To (hopefully) have them go well, and get positive reinforcement. And slowly practice and develop the mindset of agency, and have the mental moves feel smoother and more reflexive, until this is something you do naturally.\n\nTo make this more concrete, I find it helpful to reflect on what agency feels like, and how to make each part of the process smoother and more natural.\n\nFirst, I have the spark of an idea , something to do. Noticing some opportunity, inefficiency, or a desire to do something interesting.\n\nNoticing and nurturing that spark of an idea. Resisting the urge to instinctively flinch away from it, and actually thinking about it. Checking whether I actually want to do it, but actually checking, not just flinching away from something weird and risky. Exploring the idea, understanding it, and figuring out what I could actually do\n\nTaking action - finally, actually doing something about it! Being concrete, avoiding overthinking, procrastination and option paralysis, and actually doing something.\n\nSo, how to make each of these smoother? Some immediate thoughts:\n\nThe main thing is to be creative, and to open myself up to new ideas\n\nMaking time to reflect, think and brainstorm. I really like 5 minute timers for this\n\nRead a wide range of interesting things, and try to step outside your bubbles\n\nNote - it’s important to distinguish between “I am doing an idea because someone told me to”, without checking whether you want it, and “I genuinely want to do this idea someone else suggested”\n\nBe open to weird ideas - notice the ideas you immediately flinch away from. Notice if there are things you see someone else do that you’d never have thought of. Notice your default patterns of thought, and what these close you off from\n\nAmbition - Some of my best ideas come from being unafraid to think big.\n\nAsk yourself, “What would I do if I was a way more ambitious person?“\n\nIf trying to solve a difficult and intractable problem, ask “If I managed to completely solve my problem, what happened?”\n\nFilters: Notice the filters in your head that cause you to flinch away from an idea. And check whether you actually want to follow these constraints, and whether they are connected to your goals, or just reflexes stored in your head.\n\nA big one is risk-aversion - I often flinch away from ideas because it could go wrong, and this feels scary\n\nBut, please do actually check for risk! Many people are not agenty enough, but some are too agenty, and if you have a lot of agency and don’t check for risk, you can really hurt yourself\n\nFear of judgement, and a desire for social conformity\n\nA personal sense of identity - it’s hard to do something that doesn’t feel “me”. For example, on some level I identify as nerdy and averse to exercise, and this makes it way harder to entertain ideas involving exercise\n\nOften this is particularly hard because the flinch happens on auto-pilot, but noticing it takes self-awareness. For this problem, I find the technique of noticing emotions particularly helpful\n\nRedefine failure: Often I flinch away from an idea because I’m afraid of failure. In this case, I find it useful to redefine what I’m aiming for, what success/failure actually mean. If you can pull this off, and orient towards something meaningful, failure is literally no longer an option!\n\nA big one for me is making taking agency my goal. Deciding that this is a skill I want, and that any time I take agency I’m making progress.\n\nBuilding it into my identity, and trying to become a person who actually does things\n\nIn the long-term, you don’t just want agency without good judgement. But I find it is much easier to first become able to do things, and then filter for the things most worth doing, rather than trying to do both at once.\n\nSeeking novelty. It’s easy systematically under-explore, and don’t try new things enough, because the costs of not doing the standard option are concrete and visceral, while the benefits of discovering a new and better option are abstract. To counteract this, I try to build novelty seeking into my identity\n\nWhen I’ve redefined failure, I also get past the endless agonising over whether this is the “best” thing to be doing. I’m no longer analysing the object level action, I’m making progress towards the kind of person I most want to be.\n\nBe concrete: It’s easy to flinch away from an unknown idea without properly exploring it. Assume you do explore the idea, and try to make concrete what you would actually do. Suppose it goes wrong, and flesh out exactly how bad this would be, and what you could do about it.\n\nIt’s much easier to entertain an idea than to actually take action, and this helps reduce the flinch\n\nCreate tight loops between taking actions and getting results.\n\nPut a big premium on doing something now rather than later. Don’t leave enough time for motivation to fade\n\nHave easy ways to rapidly commit to something. Eg, messaging the intention to a friend, putting it in your to-do list, scheduling a time to do it properly in your calendar, etc. Put in effort beforehand, to enable yourself to be spontaneous in the moment\n\nAvoid overthinking and overplanning. Identify a rough plan, and a concrete first step, and then take it - you don’t need a perfect plan to start doing something.\n\nSet a 5 minute timer, and try to do as much as you can before the timer goes off - often this is enough to get enough activation energy\n\nTry to have a clear goal/intention when acting, don’t just go through the motions\n\nI collect some related strategies in Taking the First Step\n\nReward - Finally, you want to feel good about taking agency after the fact! The main value of practicing agency is getting better at the skill, and for that you need positive reinforcement.\n\nIdeally this happens automatically, if you take agency towards good things!\n\nAnd if you take agency towards actively bad things, it’s worth checking whether agency is a skill you actually want to cultivate\n\nRedefining failure really helps here - if you can get excited about seeking novelty or taking agency, it’s much easier to get strong and rapid positive reinforcement\n\nSeek tight feedback loops - practice agency on small things where you’ll quickly find out whether it was a good idea\n\nThe following is a grab bag of more concrete ways to cultivate agency and put this into practice. Some of these are contradictory, and aimed at different people - look for the ones that resonate, and might be of value to you!\n\nAs outlined above, practice! Look for opportunities for agency in everyday life, and take them for the sake of practicing the skill.\n\nThis can be incredibly minor things, eg being the one who gets up from the table to refill an empty water jug.\n\nMake time to regularly reflect. I am a big advocate for weekly reviews\n\nPrompts like “what would I do if I was being really ambitious?” or “what opportunities came up recently?”, “what am I missing?” or even “how could I be more agentic?” Can be really helpful\n\nTry to take ideas seriously. Notice when you flinch away from something because it feels weird or effortful, and actually think through the pros and cons. Give yourself permission to be weird and ambitious and to actually try\n\nNotice the defaults in your life, and make efforts to step past them. Try new things! Expose yourself to new ideas, and new ways of thinking. Make friends very different from yourself.\n\nTake care of yourself! Notice if you’re spreading yourself too thin. Make sure you have energy, good health, and take care of anything causing stress or taking up mental space. Build good systems . If these things are going wrong, aggressively prioritise dealing with it.\n\nTake an action orientation - try to default to saying why not, rather than no. Be willing to experiment and see what happens\n\nSeek mentors and role models who have agency, and who you can learn it from\n\nNote - there are different kinds of mentorship , and most will not give you this\n\nPersonally, I find that by far the best way to teach agency to other people is via 1-1 conversations. Understanding what the other person wants and their problems and constraints and defaults. And making suggestions for ways to do something differently and take agency. And helping them check whether this is actually what they want, and then making the intention concrete and putting it into practice\n\nExercise : Did any of these resonate? What is something concrete you could implement in your life? Set a 5 minute timer, and do something about it right now.\n\nMost of this post has been cheerleading for agency, and treating it as a virtue. But it’s worth reflecting on the drawbacks, and ways too much agency can hurt you. Some particularly notable drawbacks:\n\nThe attractor of non-conformity. Feeling uncomfortable doing anything normal, and defaulting to ignoring standard wisdom unless it’s obviously true. Sometimes things are done for a reason!\n\nThere are social consequences to weirdness, especially in certain cultures and social circles. This makes me sad, and I strongly advocate looking for friends who will help nurture your agency, but it is a real cost and consequence\n\nAgency adds a lot of variance to things. The default path is normally fairly safe, while agency opens up a lot of new avenues. The prototypical example is someone who decides to try a lot of drugs, doesn’t know how to do it safely, and ends up badly hurting themselves.\n\nAgency is hard. Making your own path can be exhausting and stressful, while following the default path can be pleasant and fine. Optimising small things may not be worth the effort\n\nAgain, I recommend picking your battles! It’s easy to fall into the attractor of thinking you must be agentic in everything, and feeling guilty when you’re not.\n\nOverall, agency is one of the most useful skills I’ve ever gained (and I still have a lot of room to grow!). And hopefully in this post I’ve helped to flesh out what, exactly, I mean by agency, reasons to value it, and concrete ways to cultivate this skill.\n\nSo, if this post resonated and you want to gain agency, my final challenge to you is this.

lot has changed in the state of crypto since we started investing in the area nearly a decade ago.\n\nThis report is the first of what will be an annual overview of trends in the crypto industry, shared through the a16z crypto vantage point of both tracking data and across the countless entrepreneurs and builders we meet. It’s for anyone who seeks to understand the evolution of the internet, and where we are on the journey towards a decentralized, community-owned-and-operated alternative to the centralized tech platforms of web2 – especially as it touches creators and other builders.\n\nThe top themes are distilled into five summary takeaways below, but be sure to dig into these 50+ slides (full deck for the 2022 State of Crypto Report available for download below); be sure to also sign up for the a16z crypto newsletter to continue getting insights as well as updates about upcoming resources.\n\nMarkets are seasonal; crypto is no exception. Summers give way to the chill of winter, and winter thaws in the heat of summer. Advances made by builders during dark days eventually re-trigger optimism when the dust settles. With the recent market downturn, we may be entering such a period now.\n\nAlthough crypto can be volatile and its cycles seem chaotic, there is an underlying logic at work, as Chris and Eddy first pointed out in 2020. (See slides 9 through 12 in the deck.) Whereas prices are often a lagging indicator of performance in some industries, in crypto they are a leading indicator. Prices are a hook. The numbers drive interest, which drives ideas and activity, which in turn drives innovation. We call this feedback loop “the price-innovation cycle”, and it has been the engine that has propelled the industry through multiple distinct waves since Bitcoin’s inception in 2009.\n\nAs legendary investor Benjamin Graham once allegorized: It’s best to pay no mind to “Mr. Market”, who frequently boomerangs from exuberance and euphoria to despair and depression. To Graham’s wisdom we add an addendum: Better to build. Consider that any prospective founders who swore off tech and the internet in the aftermath of the early-2000s dotcom crash missed the best opportunities of the decade: cloud computing, social networks, online video streaming, smartphones, etc. Now is the time to consider what the equivalent successes will be in web3.\n\nThe take-rates of web2 giants are extortionate; web3 platforms offer fairer economic terms. (See slide 39 in the deck.) Compare Meta’s nearly 100% take-rates across Facebook and Instagram to NFT marketplace OpenSea’s 2.5%. As U.S. Congressman Ritchie Torres noted in a recent op-ed , “You know something is profoundly wrong with our economy when Big Tech has a higher take rate than the mafia.”\n\nOur team conducted new data analysis to estimate how much web3 is paying out to creators compared to web2. (See slide 40 in the deck.) The numbers are telling even though it’s still early. In 2021, primary sales of Ethereum-based NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155), plus the royalties paid to creators from secondary sales on OpenSea, yielded a total of $3.9 billion. That’s quadruple the $1 billion – less than 1% of revenues – that Meta has earmarked for creators through 2022.\n\nThe numbers are even more extraordinary considering how many more web2 versus web3 users there are: We counted 22,400 web3 creators (based on the number of NFT collections) compared to the nearly 3 billion users posting content on Meta platforms. While in absolute terms, Spotify and YouTube paid out more to creators – $7 billion and $15 billion, respectively – the “per capita” disparity is striking. According to our analysis, web3 paid out $174,000 per creator, while Meta paid out $0.10 per user, Spotify paid out $636 per artist, and YouTube paid out $2.47 per channel. Web3 is tiny but mighty.\n\nCreator payouts are just one example of crypto’s benefits; there are many others.\n\nConsider the financial system. The status quo has failed many people: More than 1.7 billion people don’t have bank accounts, per the World Bank . Demand for decentralized finance or DeFi, and digital dollars, has increased dramatically in the past few years, even after accounting for the recent downturn, as the accompanying slides show. (See slides 26, 28, and 33.) For underserved and unbanked populations – 1 billion of whom have mobile phones – crypto offers a shot at financial inclusion. Projects like Goldfinch are expanding access to capital that would otherwise be unavailable in emerging markets.\n\nCrypto is addressing other broken marketplaces, too. (See slide 53 in the deck.) Flowcarbon is revamping carbon credits by making these increasingly important units of account transparent and traceable on blockchains. Helium , a grassroots wireless network, is posing the first legitimate, decentralized challenge to entrenched telecom giants. And Spruce is enabling people to control their own identities, rather than ceding that power to online intermediaries, like Google and Meta, who profit off people’s information through their data-mining business models.\n\nThe list goes on. DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, show how strangers can coordinate and cooperate economically to achieve goals. NFTs grant people virtual property rights across profile pictures, artworks, music, in-game items, access passes, land in virtual worlds, and other digital goods. And token incentives enable newcomers to bypass the “cold-start” problem and jumpstart network effects. Crypto is far more than just a financial innovation – it’s a social, cultural, and technological one.\n\nWe’ve barely just scratched the surface of what’s possible.\n\nEthereum dominates the web3 conversation, but there are plenty of other blockchains now too. Developers of blockchains like Solana, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Fantom are angling for similar success. (See slides 15 and 27 in the deck.)\n\nEthereum’s lead has much to do with its early start, and, the health of its community. As far as developer interest, Ethereum has far and away the most builders, with nearly 4,000 monthly active developers . (See slide 18.) Following that is Solana (with nearly 1,000) and Bitcoin (about 500). Ethereum’s overwhelming mindshare helps explain why its users have been willing to pay more than $15 million in fees per day on average just to use the blockchain – remarkable for such a young project. (See slide 16.)\n\nEthereum’s popularity is also a double-edged sword. Because Ethereum has historically prized decentralization over scaling, other blockchains have been able to swoop in and attract users with promises of better performance and lower fees. (Some might argue they do so at the expense of security.)\n\nBeyond challenger blockchains, we’re also seeing incredible progress with interoperability, which allows people to “bridge” assets from one blockchain to another, as well as “layer 2” technologies, such as optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups, which aim to lower costs by expanding available blockspace . (See slides 17, and 21 through 23 in the deck.)\n\nBlockchains are the hit product of a new computing wave , just as PCs and broadband were in the ‘90s and 2000s, and as mobile phones were in the last decade. There’s a lot of room for innovation, and we believe there will be multiple winners.\n\nWhile it’s hard to know the exact number of web3 users, we can reason about the scale of the movement. We estimate there are somewhere between seven million and 50 million active Ethereum users today, based on various on-chain metrics. (See slide 54.) Analogizing to the early commercial internet, that puts us somewhere circa 1995 in terms of development. The internet reached 1 billion users by 2005 – incidentally, right around the time web2 started taking shape amid the founding of future giants such as Facebook and YouTube.\n\nAgain, though it’s very hard to estimate, if the trendlines continue as depicted, web3 could reach 1 billion users by 2031. In other words, you’re still early. Much remains to be done. Let’s keep building.\n\nDownload the full pdf below, or preview our 2022 State of Crypto Report here:\n\nThe views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.

on \"asian america\" - by katie","link":"https://katiewav.substack.com/p/contemplations-on-asian-america?s=r","content":"contemplations on \"asian america\" a few thoughts on Asian America, AAPI, and the Asian-American identifier\n\nI’ve been turning over in my mind what it means to be Asian-American, what it means to be an Asian in America, what it means to be a person of color, and how a slight tweak in phrase can transform the communication of one’s political and cultural identity.\n\nA refresher: the “Asian-American” identity was conceived in the 1960s (the height of the Civil Rights movement) by graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley. The aim was to cultivate an organization of political activists of Asian descent, taking inspiration from the Black Power movement and the protests against the Vietnam War. This newly formed Asian-American alliance organized alongside Black and Chicano student organizations on campus with an agenda of equality, anti-racism, and anti-imperialism .\n\nAsian-American was a radical label of self-determination, socially constructed as a political label, rather than a cultural or familial one.\n\nIn fact, immigrants originally who arrived in the United States from various countries in Asia (China, Japan, Korea, India, the Philippines, etc.) in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries did not see themselves as part of the same racial category, nor did they make mass attempts to form alliances with each other. As a single example of many, Chinese and Korean Americans often wore buttons stating their ethnicity so that they wouldn’t be mistaken for being Japanese during World War II. It’s worth noting that even since the 1960s, hate crimes have continued to occur against Asians in America including the killing of Vincent Chin in 1982 , the 1992 LA riots , and the Atlanta spa shootings in 2021 .\n\nThe Asian populace within America has substantially evolved since the Civil Rights movement, and I think it’s worth revisiting the purpose of a term like Asian-American both at a political and cultural level today.\n\nSemantically, it’s unclear whether Asian-American or AAPI is meant to encompass East Asia, pan-Asia, American-born Asians, Asians immigrants in America, or any combination of the above. I once asked an ethnically Chinese friend of mine who grew up across London, Canada, and America whether he identified as Asian-American; he said no. He did, however, identify as AAPI which ironically stands for “Asian American Pacific Islander.” I admit that this is a bit of a silly example, but I have several anecdotes of this type of interaction, all usually ending with the conclusion that the “Asian hyphen” (ie: Chinese-Canadian or British-Indian) is a largely American phenomenon which I will unpack a bit later.\n\nThe Asian populace in America contains refugee communities, upwardly mobile Asians on skilled worker or student visas, American-born Asians whose families have resided in America for several generations, and many configurations outside and in-between. The variety of experience is particularly clear socio-economically. Over the past 50 years, “the gap in the standard of living between Asians [in America] near the top and the bottom of the income ladder [has] nearly doubled, and the distribution of income among Asians [has] transformed from being one of the most equal to being the most unequal among America’s major racial and ethnic groups.”\n\nThe colossal demographic/socio-economic differences within the Asian populace in America lead to an unsatisfactory, though perhaps not surprising, conclusion: a cohesive political identity around Asians in America, as they exist today, may not exist.\n\nIn fact, there is existential political in-fighting within the community, often engaging in an America-first ethnocentrism that may shed light on why Asian-Americans are so invested in a hyphenated label I mentioned earlier—it attempts to make their ambiguous place in the American project more clear.\n\n“[M]any politicized Asian-Americans struggle to locate their place within a US-centric black-white paradigm, wherein they must fit themselves into either the role of the oppressed ‘people of color’ or the role of the privileged white oppressor. Sometimes Asians choose option A, sometimes option B, but the end-result is usually something very confused. One consequence is that this does not open up a broader discussion about racism from multiple perspectives but instead encourages the assimilation of Asian diaspora (and Latino/a and Muslim, etc.) views into the norms and values of white liberals, namely, guilt and privilege-talk.”\n\nConsidering a lack of political cohesion, it’s fascinating that the need for “Asian representation” has become such an outcry in culture/media. Similar to the question of an Asian-American political identity, I wonder if an inclusive Asian-American cultural identity may hold water.\n\nI can trace the influx of Asian media (predominantly East Asian) in America during my lifetime through phenomena like the Hallyu wave , Asian Youtubers like Wong Fu Productions and Jenn Im , the release of Crazy Rich Asians , and of course… the infamous love for cut fruit .\n\nAt first, Asian narratives in media felt like a breath of fresh air and grossly overdue. But like many things, it occurred slowly, then all at once.\n\nI grew tired of the stinky lunchbox trope and cringed at phrases like “Asian representation.” I didn’t avoid these narratives in an assimilationist sense to become more White or in an effort to see beyond color, I was simply jaded by being fed these stories so repetitively. I couldn’t help but wonder whether annoyingly reiterating the same Asian tropes was the only way to be acknowledged in an economy fighting desperately for attention.\n\nHyun Kim articulated this well in their piece My Stinky Lunchbox Story :\n\n“[A]ny time certain types of stories are being told over and over again to the point that it starts feeling like a trope, you have to ask why. What purpose do they serve and to whom? Who keeps soliciting and publishing them?”\n\nI confess with a whisper that I fear the Asian-American identity has been pounded and molded into a clean narrative, one that can be politicized, targeted, marketed to, but in all actuality, isn’t very resonant or binding.\n\nI resent the commodified solidarity of supporting Asian-American media/products that I don’t actually enjoy simply because “economic power is political power.” I guiltily contemplate whether the ability to “dislike” something Asian-American is a privilege in itself.\n\nI question whether Asian-American as a political and cultural identifier even makes sense given the material differences we have yet to sort through and understand within ourselves—histories of oppression, imperialism, and a present state of massive inequality and political shaming.\n\nI still fail to understand my friends who grew up in communities where “everyone was Asian.” I fail to understand my friends who were the “only Asian person in their entire school.” I fail to understand my friends who are here on a visa, hailing from countries all over the world.\n\nI criticize myself for even continuing to use Asian-American and Asian in America interchangeably in this piece alone and for writing largely about East Asia.\n\nYet despite all this—the discomfort and uncertainty, the unsettling interrogation of an elusive Asian-American identity—and for reasons I continue to not understand, I still feel deeply Asian-American.\n\nI will still get “Oriental” tattoos because I don’t know how to put my feelings around my heritage into words.\n\nI still wish someone, for the love of God, would gift me an Azuki NFT.\n\nI will still eagerly go to every new Asian fusion restaurant opening in New York, and would eat dim sum every week if I could.\n\nI will still happily attend every “Asians in X” event even if the X really has nothing to do with being Asian.\n\nI will still gush over how nice it is to talk to people who “understand” anime and k-dramas.\n\nI will still continue to love contemporary Japanese fiction and have read all the “modern Asian-American canon” like Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong, Sour Heart by Jenny Zhang, Exhalation by Ted Chiang, etc.\n\nWhile I’m unable to articulate how all of these traits fulfill a greater narrative, they still fulfill my own identity, and I guess the journey now is learning how to accept that tension.\n\nA few weeks ago, I got off the subway in Brooklyn and was approached by a young Chinese girl (unverified but I could just tell). She asked me for directions to the local college so she could attend a scheduled SAT prep class.\n\nIn most cases, I would’ve just done my best to dictate the directions and gone on my way, but upon noticing she didn’t have a phone, I decided to accompany her, just to make sure she got there safely. On the walk, she told me about how she was excited to graduate high school and get out of New York, how she had begged her parents to let her attend this SAT prep class by herself (I, personally, took the Kaplan online course back in my day).\n\nI closely identified with that girl during that short encounter despite not even knowing her name and the fact that we grew up in entirely different environments (her in New York and I in suburban Georgia); I’m still not entirely sure what Asian-American identity or solidarity means to me but somehow, those few moments felt as close to an understanding as I could reach.\n\nthank you Nikhil, June, and Austin for your thoughtful edits and care \u003c3\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

supported me as I took a leave from school. However, I’ve been figuring out methods to slowly stop relying on them.\n\nOne of my goals in the next few weeks is figure out how to put myself in a position where I’ll better manage myself and become more self-sustaining.\n\nI’ve done various random hustles to earn money over the past few years. Here are some:\n\n~$12,000 from my internship last summer with state farm\n\n~$5,000 throwing money at stocks and crypto (thanks ens )\n\n~$4,000 from being a 5-star seller with 250+ reviews on Mercari\n\n~$1,000 doing various research experiments at CMU for cash/gift cards, including\n\ncontrolling a ball on a computer with my brain in eeg\n\n~$1,000 random part-time jobs like rewriting the code champion, working to revamp a maker space site , promoting gopuff as an ambassador\n\n~$500 selling clothing on my own closet on Instagram\n\n~$500 earning money for my non-profit from various fundraising events with restaurants\n\n~$500 literally labeling video data of construction workers for a research professor my freshman year\n\n~$300 creating and selling my own button pins and commission art in high school\n\n~$3.40 from medium… from my USC IYA article :’)\n\nMost of this was alongside school as I was figuring things out and I never really had that stable of a revenue stream besides my summer internship. I would not have a difficult time finding a job that pays me well , but I don’t want to do something I don’t like just for the money. I don’t like working just for money and want to put it off as much as I can to work on what I enjoy.\n\nI make money not because I like money, but because I don’t like others paying for me.\n\nI always venmo people back immediately after, almost never keep a balance in credit, and find it hard to take compliments or gifts from others. When certain friends describe how they go out and eat with guys just so they can pay for them, it sickens me.\n\nEven while dating a guy in college while in high school and I was making no money, I found ways for us to be equal. I started a closet account on Instagram to sell my old textbooks and clothing and gathered enough money to go out and eat comfortably with him on dates. Part of this comes from how I was raised — my mom taught me to never use other people, always give back when someone gives to you. No one owes you anything, and we want to be able to help others like they help us.\n\nMoney and numbers put a very particular exact value on things, and I think much of relationships have become transactional as a result of this. Some things don’t need to be measured down to the cent, and our time should not be valued as a number.\n\nI believe handling money is telling of how giving a person is. Going back to how we bartered in the old days with seashells or with goods, a good person would always ensure they’re somewhat equal, whereas someone you’d not want to do business with again would find a way out of paying you.\n\nRight now, I rely a lot on my internship money and money from my dad to sustain myself. I’ve been thinking about how I could balance what I love with monetizing my work, without creating a selfish Ponzi scheme that scams others. I want to be able to make enough to sustain myself so I don’t go back to school, but don’t care for living a lavish lifestyle or acquiring status symbols.\n\nI don’t desire dating someone rich, I don’t want to use anyone, and I don’t expect to get anything in return from giving.\n\nBack when I bought and sold makeup, I learned that money wouldn’t make me happy as I slowly worked my way up to possessing the highest end makeup. With makeup, there’s tiers to quality of makeup: drugstore (walgreens, target, walmart), mid-tier (ulta beauty), and high-end (sephora). I strove to constantly buy better makeup to replace my old makeup and resold my old makeup to not feel about buying the new and better ones. Eventually, I had collected so much higher-end makeup and experienced what it was like to have the best tools at my disposal and there was no much runway left. I had reached the point to which none of it was making me more happy.\n\nThis reminds me of how Kevin Systrom and Justin Kan describe what it’s like being on the very top. Just like how having high-end makeup didn’t ultimately make me happier, I don’t see myself getting rich to realize that’s not what life is about.\n\nIn all, I think money is really just a number that we’ve constructed to have a very absolute view on how goods or services should be exchanged.\n\nOptimizing for numbers will never have an end that will make us happier, so instead we should seek to live to impact others positively with our actions rather than having money as a sole goal of success.\n\nI hope to find a medium between monetizing what I love and am good at and continually learn while being able to support myself enough for basic necessities, and then branch out to help others and the system be more equitable.\n\nhelped make clay figurines of everyone in the house\n\nbegan turning a closet into a recording room / call booth (ty riley for helping me)\n\nwent to miami this past week for art basel \u0026 went jetskiing for the first time (tysm ami )!\n\ngot a lot of free makeup with ipsy while in miami, literally enough that it’s worth more than twice my plane ticket\n\nhave tried to get back into drawing more mushrooms 🍄 and started a shroom waifu collection on opensea\n\nminted my first nft with cryptocoven\n\nthinking of learning how to generate random mushroom art\n\ngoing to go back to california dec 17-24 (and will be in LA for ~3 days in between)! hmu to hangout 💖\n\nI confessed to a guy I like… and it didn’t work out. but was so nice finally facing my fear of taking the leap + hearing that my feelings were reciprocated and know what baseline to look for going forward\n\nthinking of going to hawaii 🏝 for a couple weeks before the uk\n\nbeen getting acupuncture for my face and it’s been getting better!\n\nAlways exciting seeing everyone’s responses to my pieces / thoughts and really appreciate the support, love you all ❤️\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

It costs money to produce good writing, to run a website, to license photographs. A lot of money, if you want quality. Asking people for a fee to access content is therefore very reasonable. You don’t expect to get a print subscription to the newspaper gratis, why would a website be different? I try not to grumble about having to pay for online content, because I run a magazine and I know how difficult it is to pay writers what they deserve.\n\nNow, crucially, I do not mean to imply here that reading the New York Times gives you a sound grasp of reality. I have documented many times how the Times misleads people, for instance by repeating the dubious idea that we have a “border crisis” of migrants “pouring into” the country or that Russia is trying to “steal” life-saving vaccine research that should be free anyway. But it’s important to understand the problem with the Times: it is not that the facts it reports tend to be inaccurate—though sometimes they are —but that the facts are presented in a way that misleads. There is no single “fact” in the migrant story or the Russia story that I take issue with, what I take issue with is the conclusions that are being drawn from the facts. (Likewise, the headline “ U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest For A-Bomb Parts ” is technically accurate: the U.S. government did, in fact, say that. It was just not true.) The New York Times is, in fact, extremely valuable, if you read it critically and look past the headlines. Usually the truth is in there somewhere, as there is a great deal of excellent reporting, and one could almost construct a serious newspaper purely from material culled from the New York Times. I’ve written before about the Times’ reporting on Hitler and the Holocaust: it wasn’t that the grim facts of the situation were left out of the paper, but that they were buried at the back and treated as unimportant . It was changes in emphasis that were needed, because the facts were there in black and white.\n\nThis means that a lot of the most vital information will end up locked behind the paywall. And while I am not much of a New Yorker fan either, it’s concerning that the Hoover Institute will freely give you Richard Epstein’s infamous article downplaying the threat of coronavirus , but Isaac Chotiner’s interview demolishing Epstein requires a monthly subscription, meaning that the lie is more accessible than its refutation. Eric Levitz of New York is one of the best and most prolific left political commentators we have. But unless you’re a subscriber of New York, you won’t get to hear much of what he has to say each month.\n\nPossibly even worse is the fact that so much academic writing is kept behind vastly more costly paywalls. A white supremacist on YouTube will tell you all about race and IQ but if you want to read a careful scholarly refutation, obtaining a legal PDF from the journal publisher would cost you $14.95 , a price nobody in their right mind would pay for one article if they can’t get institutional access. (I recently gave up on trying to access a scholarly article because I could not find a way to get it for less than $39.95, though in that case the article was garbage rather than gold. ) Academic publishing is a nightmarish patchwork, with lots of articles advertised at exorbitant fees on one site, and then for free on another, or accessible only through certain databases, which your university or public library may or may not have access to. (Libraries have to budget carefully because subscription prices are often nuts. A library subscription to the Journal of Coordination Chemistry, for instance , costs $11,367 annually.)\n\nOf course, people can find their ways around paywalls. SciHub is a completely illegal but extremely convenient means of obtaining academic research for free. (I am purely describing it, not advocating it.) You can find a free version of the article debunking race and IQ myths on ResearchGate, a site that has engaged in mass copyright infringement in order to make research accessible. Often, because journal publishers tightly control access to their copyrighted work in order to charge those exorbitant fees for PDFs, the versions of articles that you can get for free are drafts that have not yet gone through peer review , and have thus been subjected to less scrutiny. This means that the more reliable an article is, the less accessible it is. On the other hand, pseudo-scholarhip is easy to find. Right-wing think tanks like the Cato Institute, the Foundation for Economic Education, the Hoover Institution, the Mackinac Center, the American Enterprise Institute, and the Heritage Foundation pump out slickly-produced policy documents on every subject under the sun. They are utterly untrustworthy —the conclusion is always going to be “let the free market handle the problem,” no matter what the problem or what the facts of the case. But it is often dressed up to look sober-minded and non-ideological.\n\nIt’s not easy or cheap to be an “independent researcher.” When I was writing my first book, Superpredator , I wanted to look through newspaper, magazine, and journal archives to find everything I could about Bill Clinton’s record on race. I was lucky I had a university affiliation, because this gave me access to databases like LexisNexis. If I hadn’t, the cost of finding out what I wanted to find out would likely have run into the thousands of dollars.\n\nA problem beyond cost, though, is convenience. I find that even when I am doing research through databases and my university library, it is often an absolute mess: the sites are clunky and constantly demanding login credentials. The amount of time wasted in figuring out how to obtain a piece of research material is a massive cost on top of the actual pricing. The federal court document database, PACER, for instance, charges 10 cents a page for access to records, which adds up quickly since legal research often involves looking through thousands of pages. They offer an exemption if you are a researcher or can’t afford it, but to get the exemption you have to fill out a three page form and provide an explanation of both why you need each document and why you deserve the exemption. This is a waste of time that inhibits people’s productivity and limits their access to knowledge.\n\nIn fact, to see just how much human potential is being squandered by having knowledge dispensed by the “free market,” let us briefly picture what “totally democratic and accessible knowledge” would look like. Let’s imagine that instead of having to use privatized research services like Google Scholar and EBSCO, there was a single public search database containing every newspaper article, every magazine article, every academic journal article, every court record, every government document, every website, every piece of software, every film, song, photograph, television show, and video clip, and every book in existence. The content of the Wayback Machine, all of the newspaper archives , Google Books, Getty Images, Project Gutenberg, Spotify, the Library of Congress, everything in WestLaw and Lexis, all of it, every piece of it accessible instantly in full, and with a search function designed to be as simple as possible and allow you to quickly narrow down what you are looking for. (e.g. “Give me: all Massachusetts newspaper articles, books published in Boston, and government documents that mention William Lloyd Garrison and were published from 1860 to 1865.”) The true universal search, uncorrupted by paid advertising . Within a second, you could bring up an entire PDF of any book. Within two seconds, you could search the full contents of that book.\n\nLet us imagine just how much time would be saved in this informational utopia. Do I want minute 15 of the 1962 Czechoslovak film Man In Outer Space ? Four seconds from my thought until it begins. Do I want page 17 of the Daily Mirror from 1985? Even less time. Every public Defense Department document concerning Vietnam from the Eisenhower administration? Page 150 of Frank Capra’s autobiography? Page 400 of an economics textbook from 1995? All in front of me, in full, in less than the length of time it takes to type this sentence. How much faster would research be in such a situation? How much more could be accomplished if knowledge were not fragmented and in the possession of a thousand private gatekeepers?\n\nWhat’s amazing is that the difficulty of creating this situation of “fully democratized information” is entirely economic rather than technological. What I describe with books is close to what Google Books and Amazon already have. But of course, universal free access to full content horrifies publishers , so we are prohibited from using these systems to their full potential. The problem is ownership: nobody is allowed to build a giant free database of everything human beings have ever produced. Getty Images will sue the shit out of you if you take a historical picture from their archives and violate your licensing agreement with them. Same with the Walt Disney Company if you create a free rival to Disney+ with all of their movies. Sci-Hub was founded in Kazakhstan because if you founded it here they would swiftly put you in federal prison. (When you really think about what it means, copyright law is an unbelievably intensive restriction on freedom of speech, sharply delineating the boundaries of what information can and cannot be shared with other people.)\n\nBut it’s not just profiteering companies that will fight to the death to keep content safely locked up. The creators of content are horrified by piracy, too. As my colleagues Lyta Gold and Brianna Rennix write , writers, artists, and filmmakers can be justifiably concerned that unless ideas and writings and images can be regarded as “property,” they will starve to death:\n\nIs there a justifiable rationale for treating ideas—and particularly stories—as a form of “property”? One obvious reason for doing so is to ensure that writers and other creators don’t starve to death: In our present-day capitalist utopia, if a writer’s output can be brazenly copied and profited upon by others, they won’t have any meaningful ability to make a living off their work, especially if they’re an independent creator without any kind of institutional affiliation or preexisting wealth.\n\nLyta and Brianna point out that in the real world, this justification is often bullshit, because copyrights last well beyond the death of the person who actually made the thing. But it’s a genuine worry, because there is no “universal basic income” for a writer to fall back on in this country if their works are simply passed around from hand to hand without anybody paying for them. I admit I bristle when I see people share PDFs of full issues of Current Affairs, because if this happened a lot, we could sell exactly 1 subscription and then the issue could just be copied indefinitely. Current Affairs would collapse completely if everyone tried to get our content for free rather than paying for it. (This is why you should subscribe ! Or donate ! Independent media needs your support!)\n\nAt the end of last year, I published a book on socialism , and at first some conservatives thought it funny to ask me “if you’re a socialist, can I have it for free?” They were quieted, though, when I pointed out that yes, they could indeed have it for free. All they needed to do was go to the local socialized information repository known as a public library , where they would be handed a copy of the book without having to fork over a nickel. Anyone who wants to read my book but cannot or does not want to pay for it has an easy solution.\n\nI realized, though, as I was recommending everyone get my book from the library rather than buying it in a bookstore, that my publisher probably didn’t appreciate my handing out this advice. And frankly, it made me a little nervous: I depend for my living on my writing, so if everyone got my book from the library, it wouldn’t sell any copies, and then my publisher wouldn’t pay me to write any more books. We can’t have too many people using the socialized information repository when authors are reliant on a capitalist publishing industry! In fact, a strange thing about the library is that we intentionally preserve an unnecessary inefficiency in order to keep the current content financing model afloat. Your library could just give you DRM-free PDFs of my book and every issue of Current Affairs for free, but instead they make you go to the magazine room or check out one of a limited number of copies of the book, because while we want books and magazines to be free, we cannot have them be as free as it is possible to make them, or it would hurt the publishing industry too much. (Libraries preserve the fiction that there are a select number of “copies” available of a digital book, even though this is ludicrous, because abandoning the fiction would hurt publishers. They could offer every book ever written to anyone at any time. They just can’t do it legally.)\n\nI also realized, however, that I wouldn’t care how many people got my book for free if my compensation operated on a different structure, where I was paid by the number of people who read it rather than the number of people who bought it. “Impossible!” you say. “Where would the money come from?” We can imagine such a set-up quite easily, though. We have our universal public knowledge database, and anyone who wants to can type in the title of any of my books and read them for free.** But the number of people who read the book is tracked, and I am compensated two dollars for every person who reads it (a pittance, but that’s about what authors get for their sales). Current Affairs, likewise, is granted a budget proportional to its readership. Compensated from where? Budget from where? Why, from the universal public knowledge database of course. But from where do they get their money? Why, from taxes.* Free at point of use services are not some alien concept. The NHS compensates doctors while charging patients nothing . (Of course, compensation for producers wouldn’t even be that much of an issue in a society with a Universal Basic Income and where the basics of life were guaranteed. I wouldn’t care about making any money on my books if I could live decently regardless.)\n\nNow, I am sure there will be those who argue that any universal knowledge access system of this kind will inhibit the creation of new work by reducing the rewards people get. But let us note a few facts: first, dead people cannot be incentivized to be creative, thus at least everything ever created by a person who is now dead should be made freely available to all. The gatekeepers to intellectual products made by the dead are parasites the equivalent of a private individual who sets up a gate and a tollbooth in the middle of a road somebody else has already built and starts charging people if they want to pass. Actually, since parasites latch onto the living, they are better compared with corpse-eating worms.\n\nSecond, creators are already exploited: Spotify is very much like the universal searchable information database for music, it just operates for profit rather than for artists, and rights-holders get a fraction of a cent per Spotify play, an amount that must itself split between the label, the producer, the artist, and the songwriter. The CEO of Spotify has said that if artists want more money, they should make more music . (He is worth $4 billion .) And if you ever want to make a professor laugh, ask how much they make from royalties on their published academic articles. As Adam Habib, Vice-Chancellor for research at the University of Johannesburg explains , academic publishing is a “completely feudal system”:\n\n“The costs of the research production are borne by the universities, and as a result, by public monies, in most cases. Then, private companies publish the research, and charge the universities and public institutions for the very research outputs that they paid for. This is effectively the subsidy of the private sector by public money. There is a myth that this is an example of entrepreneurialism. In my view, all it does is facilitate enrichment at public cost with huge consequences for those most disadvantaged.”\n\nThis problem has not been fixed by the rise of “open-access” scholarship, because it hasn’t removed the profit motive , so poor countries are still getting screwed by the existing publishing model.\n\nThird, when considering the free information repository’s effects on content creation, you cannot look only at one side of the equation. The question of how much productivity would be inhibited by the state declining to enforce the copyrights of academic journal publishers and Getty Images must be weighed against the phenomenal unleashing of human productive power that universal free access to all human knowledge would create. You must add up how much researchers could do with the time that they now have to spend trying to track down and access things. No more would a certain thing only be in a certain library and accessible through an inter-library loan request. No more would librarians have to spend any time managing subscriptions rather than helping with searches. Researchers in the developing world would no longer be utterly unable to compete with American libraries that can afford vast fees. (I can tell you, personally, that as someone who is constantly having to find obscure used books for research and then order them and wait sometimes weeks for them to arrive, I could produce far more quickly if I could see the full content of the book in ten seconds, and I am constantly exasperated by Google Books’ “snippet view.”)\n\nFurthermore, we would have to consider what would happen in a society where the relative accessibility and cost of truth versus lies was adjusted. What if every online course was free? What if textbooks cost nothing instead of $200? What if we made it as easy and cheap as possible to find things out and were guided by the desire to create the greatest possible access to knowledge rather than by economic considerations? I do not know what would happen, but I hope some rogue state (or microstate or seastead ) that doesn’t mind pissing off the world’s most powerful corporations and governments tries to storm the Bastille of information and free every bit and byte from its artificial prison. The only thing stopping them is law, and what is law but a threat?\n\nThe good news about our times is that the possibilities for democratizing knowledge are greater than ever. We could not have started Current Affairs in 1990 unless we had about ten times more money than what we actually had . Sharp left YouTubers are fighting hard to combat propaganda and debunk bad arguments, there are tons of great podcasts, and even Twitter has its uses. (Where else do you get to yell at powerful and influential people and personally tick them off?) But it is still true that Fox News and PragerU and the American Enterprise Institute have a hell of a lot of money to blast out their message as widely as possible. There is nothing on the left of remotely comparable size and influence.\n\nBut we are working on it. We are a long way from the world in which all knowledge is equally accessible. Hopefully someday our patchwork of intentionally-inefficient libraries will turn into a free storehouse of humanity’s recorded knowledge and creativity. In the meantime, however, we need to focus on getting good and thoughtful material in as many hands as possible and breaking down the barriers we can. At Current Affairs we have no paywall, even though this might cost us some money, because we are trying to make it as easy as possible to hear what we have to say. This is what the right does. They tell people what to think, offer them books and pamphlets and handy five-minute YouTube videos. On the left we are not nearly as slick.\n\nWe can’t afford to keep our reach to those who like us so much that they are willing to pay money to listen, because then the free bullshit wins. It’s hard for small media institutions to figure out the right balance of depending on ads, paywalls, and donations. The money has to come from somewhere, after all. A lot of the times, that means a heavy dependence on ads—the traditional model of magazines has been ad-revenue based, not subscription-based—so that paywalls are actually the less corrupted model; a podcaster who sells their product on Patreon rather than giving it away but filling it with mattress and “box-of-shit-a-month” ads has an important kind of freedom: they only have to please the audience, not the sponsors. At Current Affairs, we sell subscriptions to keep the lights on , but even one person who could have read an article and doesn’t is a loss. (I wish I could give my book to everyone too but my publisher won’t let me. I did make another one free , though.) The Guardian and the Intercept provide a lot of valuable material to the public for free because they don’t have paywalls, but the Guardian is funded by a trust and the Intercept by a benevolent billionaire . (Such funding sources make things much easier. Attention benevolent billionaires: we have a donate page .) Perhaps paywalls can help publications like the New York Times and the New Statesman from having to partner with “branded content” suppliers like Shell Oil and Cigna , but at the expense of limiting reach. More reason to have publications funded by the centralized free-information library rather than through subscriptions or corporate sponsorship.\n\nCreators must be compensated well. But at the same time we have to try to keep things that are important and profound from getting locked away where few people will see them. The truth needs to be free and universal.\n\n* I will not be reading angry emails from Modern Monetary Theorists. I am assuming a country without a sovereign currency, so there.\n\n** You could, of course—and I am sure many people would want to—offer the universal database with a paywall and something like an “allowance” each month (e.g. 5 books, 100 newspaper/magazine articles, 50 scholarly journal articles, 20 films, and as many court records as they like) above which there would be a cost, and waive that cost for anyone below a certain income level. But this would involve means-testing, which makes everything needlessly complicated and inevitably means that some people will not access things who otherwise would. We do not means-test the public library and we should not means-test the universal public knowledge database.\n\nIf you enjoyed this article, please consider subscribing to our magnificent print edition or making a donation .

was intoxicated as to pass all bounds - by Shaun Usher","link":"https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/i-was-intoxicated-as-to-pass-all?s=r","content":"The following letter can be found in the first volume of Letters of Note .\n\nIt’s somewhat reassuring to know that over a thousand years ago, human beings were frequently making drunken fools of themselves at dinner parties and waking up the next day overcome with regret. In fact, this was such a regular occurrence in one region of China that a standard form letter of apology—pictured above—was created by the area’s beautifully named “Dunhuang Bureau of Etiquette,” copies regularly signed by hungover local officials and handed, with heads bowed, to disappointed dinner hosts. A ready-made apology and acceptance for the previous night’s bad behaviour. This particular version, which even included a suggested response, was discovered in a cave in 1900 and has been dated to AD 856.\n\nYesterday, having drunk too much, I was intoxicated as to pass all bounds; but none of the rude and coarse language I used was uttered in a conscious state. The next morning, after hearing others speak on the subject, I realised what had happened, whereupon I was overwhelmed with confusion and ready to sink into the earth with shame. It was due to a vessel of my small capacity being filled for the nonce too full. I humbly trust that you in your wise benevolence will not condemn me for my transgression. Soon I will come to apologise in person, but meanwhile I beg to send this written communication for your kind inspection. Leaving much unsaid, I am yours respectfully.\n\nYesterday, Sir, while in your cups, you so far overstepped the observances of polite society as to forfeit the name of gentleman, and made me wish to have nothing more to do with you. But since you now express your shame and regret for what has occurred, I would suggest that we meet again for a friendly talk.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Alice says (in an excited, breathless voice) \"I'm going to change the world by starting to work for company X, which will give me skill Y, which will make me attractive to company Z, and in company Z I'll be able to work my way up the ranks until I have the clout to get onto a committee at the United Nations, and then I'll work my way up to president of the United Nations, and from there I'll be able to make a real difference!\"\n\nBob says, \"That plan sounds stupid and will never work. Also, even if it did, the UN has no real power. I also want to change the world, but I'm not going to do it via a long convoluted hopeless plan. I'm just going to generally improve my ability to change the world and wait for a better plan to appear.\"\n\nBob is correct, in that Alice's plan is in fact hopeless. But I still have my money on Alice doing more good than Bob, in the long run.\n\nYes, her plan is bad. It's complicated, it has too many steps, and it's built on a poor model of how to change the world. But I'd still place my money on Alice.\n\nWhy? Because Alice is going to be out there bumping into the world, and Bob's going to be staying inside wishing he had actions he could commit to. Alice is going to have dozens of opportunities to realize that her plan is bad as she struggles to work her way up the ranks with her eyes set on the presidency of the United Nations. If she's sufficiently good at updating in response to evidence and truly changing her mind, then she'll realize that her original plan was silly, and she'll find better plans. And because she'll have been out there in the wild, bumping into social constraints, running into other enthusiastic people, and stumbling upon new opportunities, she'll have more chances than Bob to put herself on a good course of action.\n\nBob won't get that feedback loop when he sits at home waiting for better plans to appear.\n\nThe only way to get a good model of the world inside your head is to bump into the world , to let the light and sound impinge upon your eyes and ears, and let the world carve the details into your world-model. Similarly, the only method I know of for finding actual good plans is to take a bad plan and slam it into the world, to let evidence and the feedback impinge upon your strategy, and let the world tell you where the better ideas are.\n\nAs an example, consider Elie Hassenfeld and Holden Karnofsky, co-founders of GiveWell in 2007. GiveWell originally focused on evaluating short-term interventions on global poverty and global health. Nowadays, those two are also heading up the Open Philanthropy Project looking at riskier and (I think) much higher impact interventions. In 2006, when Elie and Holden were considering staring a charity evaluator that focused specifically on evaluating global poverty/health charities, you could have gone to them and said \"Actually, I'm not sure that's literally the best thing you could be doing. There are better ways to do good than just helping people out of poverty, we have animal suffering and existential risks and other such things to worry about.\" And you may well have been right. But it wouldn't have been helpful (and, knowing those two, you wouldn't have gotten very far). The way that Elie and Holden got to where they are is not by agonizing over whether a global poverty charity evaluation was literally the best possible thing he could be doing. They got to where they are by jumping directly into the fray and doing something. They saw that charity evaluations were crap, and jumped into the space head-first. Because of this, over the years, it was Elie and Holden — and not the person who said \"hey wait this might not be literally the best available choice\" — who learned the ins and outs of the charity landscape, made important connections, gained visible credibility, built a team of brilliant people around them, repeatedly encountered new evidence and changed his beliefs, and ended up at the helm of a massive collaborative project with Good Ventures . By now they've had a huge positive impact on the world, and are poised to continue that streak.\n\nIn my experience, the way you end up doing good in the world has very little to do with how good your initial plan was. Most of your outcome will depend on luck, timing, and your ability to actually get out of your own way and start somewhere. The way to end up with a good plan is not to start with a good plan, it's to start with some plan, and then slam that plan against reality until reality hands you a better plan.\n\nIt's important to possess a minimal level of ability to update in the face of evidence, and to actually change your mind . But by far the most important thing is to just dive in.\n\nHow, then, do you dive in? Which fray should you leap into, and how? Unfortunately, I don't have a great answer to this question. I attempted to leap into many different frays many different times, and most of the time, I bounced off. One day I'll figure out how to transmit more of the lessons I learned, but for now, the best I can say is this: It helps to have a concrete plan (even if that plan is crazy).\n\nMaybe the plan is \"I'm going to befriend my senator, and become an aide, and work my way up the ranks, and eventually become a senator myself, and then I'll have a shot at becoming the president.\" Maybe the plan is \"I'm going to get a biology PhD so that I can start my own CRISPR lab so that I can be on the forefront of human intelligence enhancement.\" Maybe the plan is \"I'm going to become a project manager at DARPA, and put in a lot of effort into figuring out who the real decision-makers are and where the real power comes from, and then I'm going to follow that trail.\" Maybe the plan is \"I'm going to read the AI papers from all the separate subfields, and have a better picture of the field than everybody else, and figure out how to ensure that the first AGI humanity builds is aligned using my own bare hands.\"\n\nThe idea doesn't have to be good, and it doesn't have to be feasible, it just needs to be the best incredibly concrete plan that you can come up with at the moment. Don't worry, it will change rapidly when you start slamming it into reality. The important thing is to come up with a concrete plan, and then start executing it as hard as you can — while retaining a reflective state of mind updating in the face of evidence.\n\nIf it becomes clear that power within DARPA is nepotistic or otherwise well-defended, maybe you'll switch tactics, and maybe you'll have a much better idea of where you could actually make a difference, now that you have more connections inside DARPA and a better understanding of the landscape. If you realize that you won't be able to understand what all the disparate AI subfields are doing just by reading their papers, maybe you'll decide to shift tactics and apprentice under as many people as possible. Your second plan doesn't need to be good or feasible either, of course — the important thing is that you (1) start with a plan; (2) get out there and start operating; and (3) get better plans as you get more information.\n\nYou're still going to need a lot of luck, and you need to be prepared for many of your plans not working.

So unless you happen to be the heir to a large estate, that time is the biggest resource you have to help others.\n\nThis means if you can increase the positive impact of those hours just a little, it will probably have a bigger impact than changes to any other parts of your life.\n\nAnd we’re going to show that — if you have the privilege to have options — you can probably increase the impact of your career not just by a little, but by a huge amount.\n\nSome of the paths open to you probably do vastly more for the world than others, but they’re probably not the ones you’re currently focusing on.\n\nOur generation faces issues of historical importance, and you can help tackle them. And you don’t have to become a doctor, teacher or a charity worker — there are many other routes to contribute that can be even higher impact.\n\nBy considering a broader range of routes, you may be able to find a path that has far more impact, while being just as — or even more — fulfilling as the path you’re currently on.\n\nSo how did we end up thinking this?\n\nWhen our founders , Ben and Will, were about to graduate in 2011, they wanted to find work they enjoyed, that paid the bills, and that made a contribution to the world. But they felt really unsure what to do.\n\nGiven the huge amount of time at stake, it seemed worth doing some real research to find the best path. But it didn’t feel like the existing careers advice even tried to compare paths in terms of impact, nor was it based on much evidence. So they started to research the question themselves.\n\nAfter 10 years of research , we now think the impact you can have in different career paths — however exactly you define ‘impact’ — is driven by four main factors:\n\nIn this article, we’ll show how you can use these factors to compare your options in terms of impact, and find new ways to contribute. (If you just want to see the bottom lines, here’s a two page summary .)\n\nWe’ll also explain how the rest of our (free) research and support can help you apply these ideas and give you the best possible chance of finding a rewarding career that fulfills your potential for impact.\n\nUnderstanding and applying these ideas takes time. But if you’d spend six minutes discussing where to go for a two-hour dinner, you should be willing to spend up to 4,000 hours researching your career. And while we sometimes do go on a bit, we promise it’ll be quicker than that.\n\nSo let’s start with the first and most important factor.\n\nWe think the most crucial question you face in choosing an impactful career is which problem or issue to focus on — whether that’s health, education, climate change, engineered pandemics, or something else.\n\nMost people seem to think that comparing the importance of these kinds of issues is near impossible, and you should just work on whatever issue you’re passionate about.\n\nBut we think it’s clear that some problems are much bigger than others.\n\nClimate change is widely considered one of the world’s biggest problems, and we think it’s even bigger than often supposed. While the most likely scenario is several degrees of warming, the uncertainty in climate models means it’s hard to rule out a 5% chance of over 10°C warming.\n\nWhat’s more, the CO 2 we emit today will stay in the atmosphere for tens of thousands of years, impacting our children’s grandchildren and beyond. We think future generations matter, which makes the issue even bigger in scale.\n\nBut we also think there may be issues that are even larger again.\n\nThe philosopher Toby Ord has argued that in 1945 humanity entered a new age, which he calls the Precipice. On July 16, 1945 humanity detonated the first atomic bomb, which would eventually make it possible — for the first time in history — for a small group of people to destroy most of the world’s cities within hours.\n\nThe annual risk of an all-out nuclear exchange is small, but it’s not zero: more countries are armed than ever, and there is always the chance of an accident or malfunction. The average of several expert surveys is an annual probability of 0.4%.\n\nCompounded over our lives and the lives of our children, this adds up to a substantial chance of a catastrophe potentially more devastating than climate change.\n\nBesides killing most people living in urban areas, the resulting fires could lift enough ash into the air to obscure the sun and reduce global temperatures for years, leading to widespread famine.\n\nWithin months, this would not only kill most people alive today, but it could also lead to a collapse of civilisation itself. We think a permanent collapse is very unlikely, but when we consider the scale of the consequences — the loss of all future generations — that risk may be the worst thing about a nuclear conflict.\n\nBut the possibility of extreme climate change and nuclear winter are just two examples of a broader trend.\n\nTechnology has given this generation unprecedented power to shape history. The consequences of the decisions we make today about nuclear weapons, genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, space settlement, and other emerging technologies could ripple forward for thousands of years, with either enormously positive or enormously negative consequences.\n\nSo: Some problems are much bigger than others.\n\nAt the same time, some problems are much more neglected by society.\n\nFor instance, in 2016 we argued that a global pandemic posed a significant global risk, but with around $10 billion spent globally on preventing the worst pandemics, it was more neglected than climate change or international development (which receive hundreds of billions) — which are in turn far more neglected than education and health in rich countries (which receive trillions).\n\nThis is important because the 1,000th person working on an issue will most likely drive much less progress than the 10th person, an effect that economists call diminishing returns.\n\nAs individuals, our role should be to find the biggest gaps in the priorities served by the current economic and political system, and do our best to fill them.\n\nInspired by this argument, one of our readers, Cassidy , realised that the knowledge she’d learned as a doctor might be put to even better use in pandemic prevention.\n\nShe applied to a masters in public health programme, and from there was able to get into a biosecurity PhD at Oxford. Since the field of pandemic control was relatively small before COVID-19, she was able to advance quickly. When COVID-19 broke out, she was ready to advise the UK government on policy ideas to control COVID-19, as well as how to prevent the next (potentially much worse) outbreak.\n\nThe importance of working on neglected issues means that following your current passions could easily point you in the wrong direction. You’re most likely to stumble across the same issues everyone is already talking about, which will usually be the least neglected. The best options are probably unconventional.\n\nWhich issues might be even more neglected than pandemics?\n\nA survey of researchers found that they believe there’s about a 50% chance that AI systems will exceed human capacities in most jobs around 2060. This would be one of the most important events in history.\n\nThese same researchers also estimated that if this happened, while the outcome might be ‘extremely good,’ there is also a 5% chance the outcome could be ‘extremely bad’ (e.g. human extinction). And as the people developing the technology, they’re probably on the optimistic side.\n\nOne reason some are concerned is that it’s unclear that as AI systems become more powerful, we can guarantee they’ll continue to stay aligned with human values. This could suggest that research into ‘AI alignment’ is a crucial challenge from a long-term perspective.\n\nSince we first wrote about it in 2012, AI alignment has grown into a flourishing field of research in computer science, but it still receives under $100 million in funding per year — about 100 times less than preventing pandemics.\n\nLong-term AI policy — addressing the question of how society and government should handle advancing AI — is yet more neglected. (Read more about our case for both .)\n\nYou might be surprised at how your current skills can be applied to unusual problems like AI alignment (and later we’ll explain how to contribute no matter your current job).\n\nBrian Tse was working at an investment bank in Hong Kong and didn’t have a background in AI. But he started to learn more about it in his spare time, and using his bilingual background, started to help translate materials to connect Western and Chinese researchers.\n\nHe now runs an independent consulting firm advising organisations in China, the United States, and Europe on the safety and governance of AI and other potentially transformative technologies — a path he also finds much more fulfilling and exciting than banking.\n\nComparing global problems is, of course, profoundly difficult. So we’ve also supported the development of the field of global priorities research , which tries to break down and answer the questions involved — for example, how we should allocate resources between reducing the risk of a disaster, on the one hand, and preventing a more certain harm on the other. There’s now an institute dedicated to this topic at Oxford. But despite the vital importance of this research, there are still only tens of researchers directly focused on it.\n\nBen Garfinkel was considering a physics PhD, but thought that since so many extremely smart people already do physics research, it would be hard to make a big contribution. He learned about global priorities research through a talk we gave, and after testing it out, decided to switch fields. He then developed important criticisms of arguments for prioritising AI .\n\nThis kind of criticism is exactly what we want to see more of. There’s a good chance our views of which problems are most pressing are mistaken in some ways or incomplete, and we want people to make the case for alternatives, and find issues we haven’t even thought of yet.\n\nElsewhere on our site, you can find a list of ideas for global problems to work on, including many issues we didn’t have a chance to mention here. Some involve neglected ways to improve our economic and political system and build a better society in general, as well as ways to directly tackle risks to the future. We also have guidance on how to compare them , and profiles about how to contribute to solving each one.\n\nYou don’t have to decide on which problem to focus on right away. As we cover in our advice on career strategy and planning , early in your career it often makes sense to focus more on exploring and building skills. However, since your choice of problem is such an important driver of your impact, it’s vital to think about as you go on, and especially before you get locked into a path.\n\nWhatever problem you decide to focus on, you need to choose an effective way to address it.\n\nScared Straight was a government programme that received billions of dollars of funding, and was made into an award-winning documentary. The idea was to take kids who committed crimes, show them life in jail, and scare them into embracing the straight and narrow.\n\nThe only problem? Two meta-analyses showed that the programme made kids more likely to commit crimes. One study even estimated that every $1 spent on this programme caused $200 of harm to society.\n\nCausing this much harm is rare, but when social programmes are rigorously tested, a large fraction of them don’t work . So it would be easy to end up working on a solution that has very little impact.\n\nMeanwhile, research finds that among solutions that are effective, the best interventions are far more cost effective than average, often achieving 10 or 100 times as much for a given unit of resources.\n\nFor example, in recent years there’s been a wave of advocacy to stop the use of plastic bags.\n\nFocusing on advocacy is a route to having much more impact than just changing your personal consumption, but it’s unclear this advocacy is well directed. Convincing someone to entirely give up plastic bags for the rest of their life (about 10,000 bags) would avoid ~ 0.1 tonnes of CO 2 emissions. In contrast, convincing someone to take just one fewer transatlantic flight would reduce CO 2 emissions by more than 10 times as much.\n\nAnd rather than trying to change personal consumption in the first place, we’d argue you could do even more to reduce emissions by advocating for greater funding of neglected green technology.\n\nIn general, it’s vital to look for the very best solution in an area, rather than those that are just ‘good’. This contrasts with the normal attitude that emphasises ‘making a difference’, rather than making the most difference possible.\n\nIn practice, this involves using rules of thumb to identify solutions that might make an especially big contribution if successful — even if there’s a good chance of failure — as well as solutions that are unfairly neglected. We call trying to identify solutions that might be positive outliers the ‘hits-based’ approach.\n\nFind out what experts believe are the best interventions in their fields by checking out our problem profiles and podcast interviews .\n\nOnce you’ve picked a problem to focus on and identified some promising solutions, you need to choose a career that will let you make them happen. And some careers will let you contribute far more resources to great solutions than others. We call this your leverage.\n\nPeople who want to have an impact often focus on jobs where they help people directly: teaching and healthcare are two of the most common paths for college graduates. But you might well be able to find options with more leverage.\n\nWe worked with a doctor, Greg Lewis, to estimate the number of lives saved by a typical clinical doctor . While the impact is significant, it’s less than commonly thought.\n\nOne reason is that the problem of health in rich countries already receives a lot of attention compared to issues like pandemics and nuclear security. But another reason is that a doctor can only treat a limited number of people each year. This motivated both Greg and Cassidy (from earlier) to switch from clinical medicine to public health and policy.\n\nAnother reader, Suzy Deuster, wanted to become a public defender to ensure disadvantaged people have good legal defence, but she realised that while that path might improve criminal justice for perhaps hundreds of people over her career, by changing policy she might improve justice for thousands or even millions. She was able to use her legal background to start a career in policy, and now works in the Executive Office of the President on criminal justice reform, and from there can explore other areas of policy in the future.\n\nThere are also other routes to leverage besides working in policy.\n\nFor instance, you can likely contribute more by building a community working on your chosen problem than you could achieve directly. If you can get just one other person to join you, then you’ve potentially doubled your impact. This means you can potentially have a very big impact no matter your current job.\n\nThe importance of spreading neglected ideas could also suggest pursuing careers in the media, or building any form of following. Isabelle Boemeke started out as a fashion model, but after speaking to experts who said nuclear energy was needed to tackle climate change, decided to use her platform to promote it as a neglected solution to climate change.\n\nYou can have leverage by helping someone else who has leverage, such as through working in operations or as a personal assistant . You can also help to build organisations which have leverage — whether nonprofit or for-profit. We list high-impact organisations hiring people with all kinds of skills on our job board .\n\nAnother form of leverage comes from money: Donations can be targeted at the most effective organisations in the world that are most in need of funding. Even if you have a very specific skill set — or don’t want to change your career — by earning and donating money, you can ‘convert’ your labour into skilled labour working on the most pressing issues.\n\nWe call this ‘earning to give’ — finding a career that uses your strengths and allows you to donate more, even if its direct impact is only neutral.\n\nAn extreme example is Sam Bankman-Fried . He learned about the arguments for earning to give when he attended a talk by one of our founders while studying physics as an undergraduate at MIT.\n\nThrough others he met in our community, Sam found a job that used his mathematical skills in quantitative trading at Jane Street Capital , and that was a great fit. From there, he went on to help found cryptocurrency derivatives exchange FTX. Now, Forbes estimates his net worth is $16 billion, making him likely the world’s wealthiest person under 30. Sam has already donated millions to causes like animal welfare and the Biden campaign, and intends to donate most of his future wealth.\n\nOver 500 of our readers are also pursuing earning to give on a more modest scale. For example, John Yan decided that a good way for him to contribute is to stay in his current job (software engineering) and donate 10–30% of his income to effective charities. Collectively the contributions of these readers will add up to tens of millions of dollars of donations, which can do a huge amount of good .\n\nFinally, remember that leverage requires time. While many young people want to have a big impact right away, research finds that most people reach their peak output at age 40–60.\n\nThis means that if you don’t feel like you have much leverage now, another option is to build what we call your ‘ career capital ’: skills, connections, and contributors to your reputation that will let you have more influence in the future.\n\n“Find work you’re good at” is a truism, but we think many people still don’t take it seriously enough.\n\nData shows that in many fields, success is distributed very unevenly .\n\nA top writer, for instance, could easily have 100 times the audience of the median. So even a small predictable difference in your suitability for two paths could translate into a big difference in outcomes.\n\nAnother reason is that being successful in almost any field gives you more connections, credibility, and money to direct towards neglected problems — increasing your leverage.\n\nFor both reasons, you need to balance your fit with a path with the other factors covered above, as well as how satisfying you’d find it . We’d rarely recommend doing something you dislike because it seems higher impact.\n\nAnd if you might be exceptional at something, it could be worth pursuing, even if you’re not sure how it’ll be useful to pressing problems. As covered in the previous section, even if you work in finance or fashion, you can use your career to have a big impact.\n\nSo how can you predict what you’ll be best at?\n\nDespite the importance of this question, there doesn’t seem to be much good evidence-based advice out there.\n\nPredictions can only go so far though, so while we’d encourage you to have hypotheses about which long-term paths will be best for you, we’d also encourage an iterative approach. Especially early in your career, you’ll learn a huge amount about your fit and the other factors, so it’s often best to find a good step for the next 1-5 years, then reassess your longer-term goals, then take another step, and repeat.\n\nWe’ve shown that you can have more impact by:\n\nWe’ve also shown that there are big differences for each.\n\nBut now also note that the differences multiply together, rather than merely add up.\n\nFor instance, if you can find a problem where additional resources are twice as effective, and — through greater leverage — direct twice as many resources to those problems, then you’ll have four times as much impact.\n\nIf you can find a path that’s twice as good on each dimension, it would be 16 times higher impact in total.\n\nAnd we’ve shown that despite the huge uncertainties involved, it’s plausible that some paths are at least 10 times higher impact than others on each dimension. This means that when multiplied together, the differences across all factors could be 100 fold or even 1,000 fold.\n\nIt’s easy to gloss over these differences in scope, but let’s appreciate for a moment just how much they matter. It could mean saving 100 times more lives, reducing carbon emissions 100 times as much, or making 100 times more progress reducing the biggest risks facing humanity.\n\nThese differences are not the only ethically relevant factors, and everyone has priorities in life besides moral ones, but they do really matter.\n\nAnother implication is that if it’s possible to find an option that’s 100 times higher impact than your current best guess, then 10 years in that path would achieve what could have otherwise taken people like you 1,000 years. You could then spend the next 30 years on a beach doing whatever you like, and still have done far more to help others.\n\nThe potential spread also illustrates why career choice is such an important ethical decision. We associate ‘ethical living’ with things like recycling or reducing your CO 2 emissions, but even with great effort, the best you could do is cut your personal footprint to near zero. But by thinking carefully about your career, you can affect the consumption of hundreds or even millions of people, and also contribute to even bigger and more neglected priorities.\n\nHow is it possible that such big differences in impact exist?\n\nOne reason is the massive economic and technological bounty of the industrial revolution, which means that today, many ordinary citizens of rich countries have what would have been kinglike wealth and power in previous centuries.\n\nAdvancing technology may make the next century one of the most important in history.\n\nOur generation can wreck the climate for thousands of years, or we can build a sustainable economy. We can continue to expand factory farming, or we can eradicate it. We can allow new technologies like nuclear weapons to end civilisation, or we can usher in a future better than we can easily imagine — and be good stewards for all future generations.\n\nOur aim is to help people like you understand this new power. If you have the good fortune to have options about how you spend your career, you can help change the course of history on these vital issues.\n\nThis is not an easy path, but it is a worthwhile one.\n\nWe’ve often felt racked with uncertainty about what to do, and overwhelmed at the scale of the issues. But we’ve also found a great deal of meaning and satisfaction in our efforts, especially as more and more people have united around them.\n\nWe still have a lot to learn, but we hope that by sharing what we’ve learned so far we can help you avoid the mistakes we’ve made, and speed you along your path to an impactful career.\n\nWe founded 80,000 Hours in 2011 to freely provide the information and support we wish we’d had when we graduated: transparently explained, based on the best research available, and willing to ask the big questions.\n\nBy doing this, we hope to get the next generation of leaders tackling the world’s biggest and most neglected problems.\n\nTo date, millions of people have read our advice, and thousands of people have told us they’ve changed careers based on it.\n\nHere’s how you can get started right now, and improve your most important decision.\n\nOur key ideas guide aims to summarise all our research on the factors discussed in this essay (and more), in order to help you answer the key questions that determine your impact:\n\nYou can also explore these ideas by subscribing to our podcast, which features in-depth conversations with experts on the world’s most pressing problems and how you can help solve them.\n\nWe’ve reviewed different global problems, career paths, and jobs to help you find new ways to contribute.

of Change (Aaron Swartz's Raw Thought)","link":"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange","content":"I am increasingly convinced that the difference between effective and ineffective people is their skill at developing a theory of change. Theory of change is a funny phrase — I first heard it in the nonprofit community, but it’s also widespread in politics and really applies to just about everything. Unfortunately, very few people seem to be very good at it.\n\nLet’s take a concrete example. Imagine you want to decrease the size of the defense budget. The typical way you might approach this is to look around at the things you know how to do and do them on the issue of decreasing the defense budget. So, if you have a blog, you might write a blog post about why the defense budget should be decreased and tell your friends about it on Facebook and Twitter. If you’re a professional writer, you might write a book on the subject. If you’re an academic, you might publish some papers. Let’s call this strategy a “theory of action”: you work forwards from what you know how to do to try to find things you can do that will accomplish your goal.\n\nA theory of change is the opposite of a theory of action — it works backwards from the goal, in concrete steps, to figure out what you can do to achieve it. To develop a theory of change, you need to start at the end and repeatedly ask yourself, “Concretely, how does one achieve that?” A decrease in the defense budget: how does one achieve that? Yes, you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Congress passes a new budget with a smaller authorization for defense next year.\n\nYes, that’s true — but let’s get more concrete. How does that happen?\n\nAUDIENCE: Uh, you get a majority of the House and Senate to vote for it and the President to sign it.\n\nGreat, great — so how do you get them to do that? Now we have to think about what motivates politicians to support something. This is a really tricky question, but it’s totally crucial if we want to be effective. After all, if we don’t eventually motivate the politicians, then what we’ve done is useless for achieving our goal. (Unless we can think of some other way to shrink the defense budget.)\n\nBut this is also not an insoluble problem. Put yourself in the shoes of a politician for a moment. What would motivate you? Well, on the one hand, there’s what you think is right. Then there’s what will help you get reelected. And finally there’s peer pressure and other sort of psychological motivations that get people to do things that don’t meet their own goals.\n\nSo the first would suggest a strategy of persuading politicians that cutting the defense budget was a good idea. The second would suggest organizing a constituency in their districts that would demand they cut the defense budget. And maybe one of you can figure out how to use the third—that’s a little trickier.\n\nBut let’s stick with the first, since that’s the most standard. What convinces politicians that something is the right thing to do?\n\nIn a sense, I suppose. But those are going to be pretty hard to change. I’m thinking more, if you have a politician with a given set of beliefs, how do you convince them that cutting the defense budget advances those beliefs?\n\nAUDIENCE: You outline why to them.\n\nWell, OK, let’s think about that. Do you think if you ran into Nancy Pelosi in the hallway here and you tried to explain to her why cutting the defense budget would accomplish her beliefs, that you’d convince her?\n\nAUDIENCE: Because she wouldn’t really listen to me — she’d just smile and nod.\n\nYeah. Nancy Pelosi doesn’t trust you. She’s never met you. You’re not particularly credible. So you need to find people the politicians trust and get them to convince the politicians.\n\nAlright, well, we can continue down this road for a while — figuring out who politicians trust, figuring out how to persuade them, figuring out how to get them to, in turn, persuade the politicians, etc. Then, when the politicians are persuaded, there’s the task of developing something they can vote for, getting it introduced so they can vote on it, then getting them to vote on the specific measure even when they agree with the overall idea. You can see that this can take quite a while.\n\nIt’s not easy. It could take a while before you get to a concrete action that you can take. But do you see how this is entirely crucial if you want to be effective? Now maybe if you’re only writing a blog post, it’s not worth it. Not everything we do has to be maximally effective. But DC is filled with organizations that spend millions of dollars each year and have hardly even begun to think about these questions. I’m not saying their money is totally wasted — it certainly has some positive impacts — but it could do so much more if the people in charge thought, concretely, about how it was supposed to accomplish their goals.\n\nI’ll close with one more example, showing how this strategy can be used personally as well. I was at a party once and I told someone I was writing a book and that I wanted it to be a bestseller. They laughed at that and I think it’s because they had a theory of action model in their head: you write the best book you can, and of course you want it to be a bestseller, but either it does or it doesn’t.\n\nBut I was working backwards, I had a theory of change: I asked, What makes something a best seller? Well, lots of people buy it. OK, how do you get lots of people to buy something? Well, you have to persuade them it’s something they want. OK, how do you persuade them it’s something they want? Well, first it has to meet some desire or need they have and second you need to explain to them how it meets that need. So what are the desires or needs people have? (Looking at bestsellers: entertainment, escape, self-improvement, etc.) What are the ways of explaining your book meets their need? (Being popular early on, appearances in the media, persuading readers to tell other readers, etc.)\n\nAgain, we can keep going for quite a while until we get all the way back to something I can actually do. But because of this, I didn’t have to simply have to hope that my book became a bestseller, like every other author. I could actually do something about it.\n\nThat’s the power of a theory of change.\n\nYou should follow me on twitter here .","tokenFrequency":{"trickier":1,"concret":5,"turn":1,"money":1,"unfortun":1,"actual":2,"set":1,"useless":1,"hope":1,"approach":1,"increas":1,"realli":3,"there":4,"theori":8,"i'll":1,"that":3,"particular":1,"next":1,"like":1,"stick":1,"wouldn't":1,"opposit":1,"entir":1,"power":1,"look":2,"spend":1,"sign":1,"academ":1,"dollar":1,"congress":1,"around":1,"hallway":1,"selfimprov":1,"task":1,"goal":5,"could":3,"littl":1,"dc":1,"help":1,"budget":10,"psycholog":1,"credibl":1,"—":8,"well":7,"everyth":2,"begun":1,"need":7,"major":1,"close":1,"imagin":1,"decreas":4,"effect":4,"year":2,"go":2,"show":1,"find":2,"twitter":2,"entertain":1,"widespread":1,"develop":3,"motiv":4,"given":1,"end":1,"call":1,"maxim":1,"explain":3,"popular":1,"follow":1,"organ":2,"much":1,"post":2,"posit":1,"measur":1,"meet":4,"sort":1,"one":5,"hard":2,"question":2,"convinc":5,"head":1,"way":4,"let":5,"eventu":1,"advanc":1,"work":3,"start":1,"that”":1,"achiev":4,"media":1,"audienc":4,"“theori":1,"standard":1,"thought":1,"person":1,"senat":1,"write":5,"escap":1,"outlin":1,"constitu":1,"issu":1,"sinc":1,"suggest":2,"charg":1,"laugh":1,"third—that":1,"best":2,"politician":11,"peopl":8,"appli":1,"becam":1,"would":5,"nonprofit":1,"skill":1,"know":2,"funni":1,"agre":1,"told":1,"peer":1,"shoe":1,"shrink":1,"support":1,"problem":1,"belief":3,"uh":1,"district":1,"unless":1,"use":2,"true":1,"right":2,"hous":1,"total":2,"thing":4,"pelosi":2,"worth":1,"forward":1,"nanci":2,"think":8,"certain":1,"pass":1,"backward":2,"put":1,"wast":1,"we'v":1,"size":1,"mayb":2,"appear":1,"never":1,"tricki":1,"accomplish":3,"blog":3,"publish":1,"get":12,"author":2,"cut":4,"heard":1,"nod":1,"want":7,"happen":1,"differ":1,"great":2,"easi":1,"exampl":2,"see":2,"hand":1,"figur":5,"make":1,"insolubl":1,"cours":1,"even":2,"impact":1,"ask":2,"seller":1,"it":7,"earli":1,"crucial":2,"desir":2,"don't":2,"member":1,"say":1,"take":4,"pressur":1,"yes":2,"everi":1,"":21,"etc":3,"action”":1,"moment":1,"she":1,"smaller":1,"also":2,"step":1,"tri":2,"sens":1,"persuad":7,"road":1,"continu":1,"you'd":1,"book":5,"model":1,"overal":1,"she'd":1,"final":1,"lot":2,"either":1,"friend":1,"ran":1,"reelect":1,"facebook":1,"second":2,"million":1,"communiti":1,"subject":1,"you'r":4,"defens":10,"polit":1,"ok":3,"fill":1,"quit":2,"i'm":2,"done":1,"phrase":1,"introduc":1,"strategi":3,"paper":1,"writer":1,"presid":1,"“concret":1,"repeat":1,"met":1,"tell":2,"bestsel":4,"doesn't":2,"idea":2,"listen":1,"trust":3,"ineffect":1,"back":1,"new":1,"someon":1,"simpli":1,"reader":2,"action":3,"smile":1,"demand":1,"seem":1,"good":2,"yeah":1,"vote":4,"pretti":1,"someth":9,"suppos":2,"first":4,"parti":1,"alright":1,"typic":1,"might":4,"didn't":1,"keep":1,"buy":2,"chang":7,"specif":1,"profession":1}},"26253":{"id":"26253","title":"Nomen est omen - by Roger's Bacon - Secretum Secretorum","link":"https://rogersbacon.substack.com/p/nomen-est-omen?s=r","content":"An aptronym is when a person has a name that is uniquely suited to its owner. Some examples:\n\nMarijuana Pepsi Vandyck , American education professional with a dissertation on uncommon African-American names in the classroom\n\nPhilander Rodman, father of basketball player Dennis Rodman , who fathered 26 children by 16 mothers\n\nAnd of course there are also inaptronyms:\n\nRobin Mahfood , President and CEO of Food for the Poor\n\nMaybe this is all coincidence, or maybe it’s nominative determinism , the hypothesis that people that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names (an idea captured in the ancient Roman proverb “nomen est omen” meaning “the name is the sign”). Psychologist Lawrence Casler proposed three possible explanations for nominative determinism: one's self-image and self-expectation being internally influenced by one's name; the name acting as a social stimulus, creating expectations in others that are then communicated to the individual; and genetics—attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname.\n\nBut does nominative determinism actually exist—are people with occupation-related names over-represented in those occupations? After an extensive review of the literature (lol jk I just read the wikipedia page), my conclusion is: eh, I guess so? Some studies have found a fairly strong effect but these have been criticized for failing to properly account for confounds; other (slightly) more rigorous studies seem to find weak effects and some analyses show no effect at all. So basically it’s just like any other psychological theory that we’ve turned a more critical eye to in recent years.\n\nThis section from the wikipedia page had me rolling in laughter.\n\nIn 2015 researchers Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb published a paper on their study into the effect of surnames on medical specialisation. They looked at 313,445 entries in the medical register from the General Medical Council, and identified surnames that were apt for the speciality, for example, Limb for an orthopaedic surgeon, and Doctor for medicine in general. They found that the frequency of names relevant to medicine and to subspecialties was much greater than expected by chance. Specialties that had the largest proportion of names specifically relevant to that specialty were those for which the English language has provided a wide range of alternative terms for the same anatomical parts (or functions thereof). Specifically, these were genitourinary medicine (e.g., Hardwick and Woodcock) and urology (e.g., Burns, Cox, Ball). Neurologists had names relevant to medicine in general, but far fewer had names directly relevant to their specialty (1 in every 302). Limb, Limb, Limb and Limb did not report on looking for any confounding variables. In 2010 Abel came to a similar conclusion. In one study he compared doctors and lawyers whose first or last names began with three-letter combinations representative of their professions, for example, \"doc\", \"law\", and likewise found a significant relationship between name and profession. Abel also found that the initial letters of physicians' last names were significantly related to their subspecialty. For example, Raymonds were more likely to be radiologists than dermatologists.\n\nThis kind of blew my mind—there is actually some evidence for the genetic explanation (i.e. attributes suited to a particular career being passed down the generations alongside the appropriate occupational surname).\n\nAs for Casler's third possible explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, but it was not statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.\n\nNominative determinism is about how someone’s name can influence their choice of a career. What’s more interesting to me is something like the reverse of this—how a name can influence the way someone is perceived and treated by others, perhaps giving the person a small advantage that increases their chances of success (or a disadvantage that increases their chances of failure). I’ve had this pet theory for a while that names are super important for an athlete, that a great name can become a self-fulfilling prophecy which can propel its owner to stardom. Cristiano Ronaldo, Peyton Manning, Lebron James, Lionel Messi, Tom Brady, Kobe Bryant—I’ve always felt like the best athletes usually have strong, catchy names and that this has somehow played a role in their greatness. Sure, this might just be hindsight bias, but hear me out—I think there is a plausible mechanism for how this might work.\n\nYou might have heard of the Bouba-Kiki effect, recently popularized by this meme . Quick, without thinking—which one of these figures is kiki and which is bouba?\n\nIf you are like ~95% of people then you thought the left image was kiki and the right was bouba.\n\nThe bouba/kiki effect is a non-arbitrary mapping between speech sounds and the visual shape of objects. It was first documented by Wolfgang Köhler in 1929 using nonsense words. The effect has been observed in American university students, Tamil speakers in India, young children, and infants, and has also been shown to occur with familiar names. It is absent in individuals who are congenitally blind and reduced in autistic children.\n\nRamachandran and Hubbard suggest that the kiki/bouba effect has implications for the evolution of language, because it suggests that the naming of objects is not completely arbitrary. The rounded shape may most commonly be named \"bouba\" because the mouth makes a more rounded shape to produce that sound while a more taut, angular mouth shape is needed to make the sounds in \"kiki\"\n\nI bring this up as an example of how the raw sonic qualities of a name can bring to mind certain abstract associations. The name Tom Brady just sounds more powerful than Blake Bortles (a top quarterback prospect who flopped—I totally predicted that he was going to suck). There is a pleasant lyricality to the name Cristiano Ronaldo, it just sounds like the name of person who would be famous. Lionel Messi also sounds like it would be the name a legendary athlete—Lionel calls to mind lions, the so-called king of the jungle, and the name Messi sounds like it could be the name of famous artist, like Dalí or Da Vinci.\n\nSo what is the actual mechanism whereby a great name leads to athletic greatness? Say you are 8 year old Tom Brady (or Cristiano Ronaldo or whoever) playing on your first (american) football team. The coach, just some random dude who coaches youth football, doesn’t really have any sense of the athletic abilities or personalities of his players at first. They have a few practices and the coach slowly starts to get a sense of who’s good and who’s not. Maybe young Tom Brady seems like he’s one of the best athletes, but there are other kids who are bigger or faster (Brady certainly didn’t become the winningest quarterback of all time because he was a freak athlete). Eventually you have to choose a quarterback, the most important player and natural leader of the team (for those who aren’t familiar with the sport), and you go with your gut and choose that Tom Brady kid—you don’t really know why, he just seems confident, a good-looking kid who has a natural charisma about him (basketball hall-of-famer Charles Barkley, also the owner of great name, has said about Brady , “I made a mistake. I looked Tom Brady in the eyes. I'm looking at these guys and Tom Brady is right here and I look him in the eyes and I say ‘damn you a pretty man’ ”). I’m giving a fictional example here obviously but this is basically my experience with coaching youth sports of varying ages (mainly high school) for 6+ years—there are just certain kids that you like and want to see succeed for reasons that you can’t really articulate. You really don’t have a lot to go on at first when choosing the point guard/striker/team captain/etc. so you end up going with your gut and choosing the kid that seems like he has the “it” factor.\n\nSo young Tom Brady gets a little boost of confidence from being chosen to play quarterback. This sets in motion a snowballing Matthew effect (“the rich get richer”) that has a not-insignificant impact on his athletic destiny. Many youth programs carry the same group of kids up through the age groups, so once young Tom Brady does well at quarterback in his first year he is almost certainly going to play the position and be the leader of the team going forward. His early success has all kinds of knock-on effects that feedback on themselves in a virtuous loop—his coaches give him more attention and encouragement, this motivates young Tom to work even harder, his parents see all of this and invest more time/money/attention into his budding football career, and so on and so forth.\n\nSo then we have 18-year old Tom Brady who has been a leader and a winner his entire life. Not only does this provide all of the aforementioned psychological benefits, it also changes him physically.\n\nIn many animal societies, a high dominance rank is beneficial ( 1 , 2 ). High-ranking primates, for example, tend to experience higher reproductive success and/or greater offspring quality as measured by survival, growth rates, and accelerated maturation ( 3 – 8 ). Social rank also influences health ( 9 ). ( source )\n\nBeing the alpha male monkey in his peer group (which for young boys is not a far-cry from a chimpanzee society) means that young Tom has a lifetime of elevated testosterone levels (both a cause and consequence of having a high dominance rank), that he hits puberty earlier (which just cements his dominant status even further), and receives a whole host of other physiological benefits that help him grow to be stronger and more athletically skilled than he would have otherwise been.\n\nThis was all incredibly painful for me to write because I actually hate Tom Brady (sports hate not real hate) as my favorite team (the Baltimore Ravens) was rivals with Brady’s New England Patriots teams. I chose to use him as the example because (1) american football felt like the best sport to use because of the unique nature of the quarterback position and (2) the other person I would’ve used, Peyton Manning (who was actually better than Tom Brady but just had worse coaches/teams during his career—fight me), had a dad (Archie) who was also a hall-of-fame quarterback so he was already marked for greatness for reasons other than having a good name. On the other hand, maybe I should have gone with the Manning example and avoided the whole vomit-inducing exercise of having to write positive things about Tom Brady because it might illustrate my point on an even deeper level—this snowballing Matthew effect can even be intergenerational. Everything I said about young Tom probably holds even more so for young Archie (born in 1949) as he was playing youth football at a time when much less money/attention was devoted to identifying and cultivating athletic talent, thus making it even more likely that a random superficial factor could change a young athlete’s trajectory. So Archie Manning, aided in some small part by his strong surname, becomes a rich and famous Super Bowl-winning quarterback and then goes on to have not 1 but 2 sons, Peyton and his little brother Eli (not as great as Peyton, but also a two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback), who also become all-time greats because they are born with every possible advantage one could want for an aspiring quarterback. And it hasn’t stopped there—now Peyton and Eli’s nephew Arch is also a top high school quarterback prospect.\n\nThere is of course no reason why this naming effect would only be limited to athletics. Philosophy Bear has a really interesting idea called writerly bias that feels relevant here (h/t to friend of the blog Brad \u0026 Butter for sharing this).\n\nOnly important intellectuals and artists write or create works on the human condition that are well remembered, but most people are neither important artists or intellectuals, thus we should expect cultural understandings of the human condition to be jaundiced with the perspective of artists and intellectuals.\n\nI call this the writerly bias - the literature is, unavoidably, stacked towards writers, but we understand ourselves through this tradition, ergo, their is an inescapable flaw in the way we see ourselves.\n\nNow I've been trying to think of examples of how this might manifest, and I have one possible example, which I call epiphanism, viz:\n\nArtists and intellectuals, compared to most people, are unusually likely to have epiphanies or sudden realizations that affect the course of their lives. Thus we should expect sudden life changing epiphanies to be more prominent in cultural understandings of what it is to be human than in fact they are in reality.\n\nBut I'm wondering, do people have other examples of the writerly fallacy in action? Or speculation as to forms it takes?\n\nI see the writerly bias as linked to other biases. For example, the narrative bias:\n\nOur understanding of what it is like to be human, and how lives generally unfold, will be stacked towards forms of experience that can be placed into coherent narratives, because this is what is mostly to get written (and even spoken!) about.\n\n[This also ties into epiphanism, because epiphanies make great narratives]\n\nAnyone who has ever caught themselves analyzing their own life in terms of literary tropes, even for a moment, or feels surprised that something which felt like foreshadowing never eventuates, knows what narrative bias is like.\n\nAll very fascinating, but I wonder if writerly bias applies beyond our understanding of the human condition to human history itself. Yes, history is written by the victors, but it’s also written by the writers (duh); in other words, people who are good writers, who for whatever reason are good at coming up with highly virulent memes—easily remembered terms, catchy slogans, witty quips, inspirational mottos, powerful or well-fitting names—will have an outsize impact on the the course of history. This memetic ability will correlate strongly with verbal and social intelligence, but not completely—some people just have an ineffable knack for coining terms or naming things (today we might call this being good at twitter).\n\nHow many movements, philosophies, religions, or empires have risen or fallen because of the memetic contagiousness of their name? How much has the flow of history been altered by a good name at the right place and the right time, or a bad name at the wrong place and the wrong time?\n\nProbably not that much, but also probably more than you might think.\n\nIn 20 Modern Heresies , I wrote/quote the following:\n\n“15. The virtually universal practice of assigning a permanent name at birth (which only exists so that governments can more easily tax us) has caused a species-wide shift towards a more narcissistic and egotistical mode of being.\n\n“In these preconquest regions of New Guinea names were rarely binding. What one was called varied according to time, place, mood, and setting. Names were improvised, not formally bestowed, and naming (much like local language flexibility) was often a kind of humorous exploratory play. New names could be quickly coined, often whimsically from events and situations, with a new one coming up at any time. One young boy running in a peculiar way was affectionately dubbed 'Grasshopper': It stuck. Another was called 'Kaba' (short for the prized embokaba beetle) because, during an episode of biting-mouthing play, a friend proclaimed his skin was as delicious as that savory beetle's flesh. One girl was called 'Aidpost' following her excitement about the first one in the region; another was called 'Sleepgood' by a new friend who liked sleeping with her. A boy from a distant hamlet in the south who tagged along when I went north to the new Australian Patrol Post fled into the jungle in crouched, zigzagging panic when an object he believed to be a metal house abruptly growled and moved. His name became 'Land Rover'.\n\nNames were nicknames. They stuck for a while, then a new one came along. Only when the new (Australian) government began insisting that they use the same name for official dealings, especially in the annual census soon instituted, did formal names emerge.”\n\nI want dig a little bit deeper into this heresy as, unlike some of the others, this is one that I actually avow. First, I really mean it when I say that our modern naming conventions (roughly, a permanent personal given name and inherited surname bestowed at birth) only exist so that governments could more easily tax us. From Scott Alexander’s (excellent) review of James C. Scott’s Seeing Like a State.\n\nScott describes the spread of surnames. Peasants didn’t like permanent surnames. Their own system was quite reasonable for them: John the baker was John Baker, John the blacksmith was John Smith, John who lived under the hill was John Underhill, John who was really short was John Short. The same person might be John Smith and John Underhill in different contexts, where his status as a blacksmith or place of origin was more important.\n\nBut the government insisted on giving everyone a single permanent name, unique for the village, and tracking who was in the same family as whom. Resistance was intense:\n\nWhat evidence we have suggests that second names of any kind became rare as distance from the state’s fiscal reach increased. Whereas one-third of the households in Florence declared a second name, the proportion dropped to one-fifth for secondary towns and to one-tenth in the countryside. It was not until the seventeenth century that family names crystallized in the most remote and poorest areas of Tuscany – the areas that would have had the least contact with officialdom. […]\n\nState naming practices, like state mapping practices, were inevitably associated with taxes (labor, military service, grain, revenue) and hence aroused popular resistance. The great English peasant rising of 1381 (often called the Wat Tyler Rebellion) is attributed to an unprecedented decade of registration and assessments of poll taxes. For English as well as for Tuscan peasants, a census of all adult males could not but appear ominous, if not ruinous.\n\nThe same issues repeated themselves a few hundred years later when Europe started colonizing other continents. Again they encountered a population with naming systems they found unclear and unsuitable to taxation. But since colonial states had more control over their subjects than the relatively weak feudal monarchies of the Middle Ages, they were able to deal with it in one fell swoop, sometimes comically so:\n\nNowhere is this better illustrated than in the Philippines under the Spanish. Filipinos were instructed by the decree of November 21, 1849 to take on permanent Hispanic surnames. […]\n\nEach local official was to be given a supply of surnames sufficient for his jurisdiction, “taking care that the distribution be made by letters of the alphabet.” In practice, each town was given a number of pages from the alphabetized [catalog], producing whole towns with surnames beginning with the same letter. In situations where there has been little in-migration in the past 150 years, the traces of this administrative exercise are still perfectly visible across the landscape. “For example, in the Bikol region, the entire alphabet is laid out like a garland over the provinces of Albay, Sorsogon, and Catanduanes which in 1849 belonged to the single jurisdiction of Albay. Beginning with A at the provincial capital, the letters B and C mark the towns along the cost beyond Tabaco to Wiki. We return and trace along the coast of Sorosgon the letters E to L, then starting down the Iraya Valley at Daraga with M, we stop with S to Polangui and Libon, and finish the alphabet with a quick tour around the island of Catanduas.\n\nThe confusion for which the decree is the antidote is largely that of the administrator and the tax collector. Universal last names, they believe, will facilitate the administration of justice, finance, and public order as well as make it simpler for prospective marriage partners to calculate their degree of consanguinity. For a utilitarian state builder of [Governor] Claveria’s temper, however, the ultimate goal was a complete and legible list of subjects and taxpayers.\n\nWhen naming conventions are created by governments and for governments, they favor legibility and as a consequence, individuality and stability of identity. In my brief heretical statement, I suggested that our modern naming conventions have caused a species-wide shift towards a more narcissistic and egotistical mode of being. Maybe this goes too far (or not far enough…), but the more general idea I’m trying to raise is that personal nomenclature is never value neutral and never without cultural and psychological ramifications. In other words, we shouldn’t be surprised that our culture has become sterile, stagnant, and individualistic to a fault when those values are embedded in the way we name ourselves.\n\nThe global hegemony of governmentally-developed naming systems has crippled our imagination by removing alternative models of nomenclature. Consider the snapshot of indigenous New Guinean nomenclature provided in the above quote—names were fluid and not taken incredibly seriously, often being whimsically coined by friends or other members of the community because of some event or personal trait. This characterization of indigenous naming as “humorous exploratory play”, while certainly true to some extent, also reflects a deeply ingrained modern western bias—we can’t help but see temporary “nicknames” as unserious, not like our names, those momentous binding labels that can only be bestowed upon us by our parents. On the contrary, indigenous peoples often used names fluidly and treated them very seriously, in some ways much more seriously than we do now, seeing them as tools which can be used to help individuals grow and orient themselves within the tribe.\n\nConsider the following account of Native American naming traditions :\n\n“Native American children are given names that suit their personalities. If a name is given and proves to be a bad fit, the child’s name is changed. At adolescence, the given name may be changed again. As the adult progresses through life, new names can be awarded. Family and society award the new names, which provide the individual with a strong social bond to community as well as family. This naming tradition helps to motivate the individual to grow throughout life.\n\nA Native American name can reflect your personality, what you accomplish, or what happens to you. The name Dancing Wind sounds beautiful to our ears, but Native Americans know that the dancing wind is an image for the tornado. This name warns of a volatile, angry disposition. It serves as a warning to others as well as an incentive to Dancing Wind to earn a new name. The name Bear is a common name like John. If the name is changed to Wounded Bear, society knows the individual is suffering and needs special care. If an individual accomplishes great things, a new name like “Eagle Eye” may be given to recognize the individual’s clear-sighted perception.\n\nIn addition to the psychological, social, and environmental dimensions of their names, Native Americans also have an added spiritual dimension with a secret, sacred name that is known only to the individual and the medicine man. If an individual has a secret sacred name that represents a pure essence, it can never be contaminated, no matter what happens to “the outside” name. This secret sacred name provides the individual with a pure spiritual core from which to regenerate should the individual experience any trauma.”\n\nNaming systems are reflections of a culture’s values, but, as I’ve argued, it’s a two-way street—the way we name ourselves reinforces these values and frames how we think about ourselves and the world around us. When legibility, individuality, and stability of identity are the master values of our personal nomenclature, of course we will look for legible, de-personalized solutions (e.g. technology, laws, governmental programs) to society’s ills (environmental degradation, social isolation and loss of community, mental health and addiction, to name just a few). These solutions are only partial and always will be because they don’t get to the root of the problem: ourselves—who we are as people, what we value, and how we think. There is no shortcut to profound personal change, but a first step in the right direction might make all the difference—if we want to be the kind of people who value community and the natural world and who believe that people can grow and overcome trauma then perhaps we should name ourselves in a way that inspires us to be those kind of people.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

mid-twenties (mini-📝 1/100) - by Spencer Chang","link":"https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/the-mid-twenties?r=2037y","content":"the mid-twenties (mini-📝 1/100)\n\nSo I turned 24 yesterday and the biggest question on my mind (as it seems to have incepted all of my friends’ minds) is: does 24 count as “mid-twenties”? “Welcome to your mid-twenties” my friends quip. Others take the less subtle approach: “you’re an old man”. For some reason, people in their early twenties have an obsessive fear of the mid and late-twenties. Perhaps, it’s because young professionals in their early twenties still want to pretend that they’re in school and that things don’t have real consequences and there is an opportunity for do-overs. We crave the spontaneity of campus, the non-commitment of parties, the safety of a bubble. At Rice we used to call this phenomenon going “beyond the hedges.” It was a big issue that the school and the student association tried to solve for by naming the problem and devising solutions to encourage students to leave the campus they paid good money to go to school at. The effort was designed to help introduce students to the world outside the magical village that the school campus consisted. For most students, you got glimpses in your weekly off-campus food adventures or the occasional concert-festival-artsy gathering, but none of these really brought students face-to-face to the real dangers of the real world. We were afforded a safety that people scarcely recognized and appreciated. The few real encounters with danger that we were privy to were the occasional campus police reports of armed robberies, stalking, or petty thievery.\n\nThe mid twenties mark a related reckoning. It’s when we’re pushed to stop pretending that we’re “just recent grads” who don’t know what we’re doing. We’re not clueless about the things that adults have to care about on a normal basis. The messy, awful, annoying, frustrating, insane, pointless, necessary dues to being a functional adult in society. Things like doing your taxes on time while making the proper benefits enrollment choice and dealing with that hospital bill that just so happened to miss your inbox until it was too late to submit it to the insurance. Perhaps it involves dealing with that harbinger of misery coworker or playing “ the game ” to climb the ladder, maybe it even involves keeping a plant or two alive while trying not to starve yourself in between all the emails and the calendar invites and the meetings scheduled through the emails and earmarked through the calendar invites. The precious slots of your early twenties just perfect little canvases for stuffing more and more frustration into. Our excuse of being only recently indoctrinated into the game of society is wearing thinner and people are expecting us to get with the program.\n\nMaybe it’s a reckoning precisely because we’re getting close to the point of no return: the precipice where we must make a decision between getting with the program and forging our own path. It comes to a binary choice between playing the Game of Life as society expects you to do and following your heart for what you want. Unfortunately, if it was as simple as that sounded it’d probably be a no-brainer to everyone to choose the latter. While everyone most likely wants to pursue the latter, it’s very hard in practice to commit to it. Everything in the world conspires to make you choose the latter. It’s the easy path. The expected path. The optimized path. The problem is that we can’t go live in a vacuum in the latter—the real world and the vast majority of people around us are playing the Game and so for us to be understood, simply to interact in this environment, we have to play the Game too. This means that should you want to pick the latter, you have to constantly context switch. You have to know when to play the Game and when to forge your own path and make your own illegal rules. You have to understand that there are contexts where you must operate by the rules of the game, and the one time you have to truly be free is in your own private space, whether it’s just you or you and your community of partners-in-thought-crime. The other part you need to understand is that everything that happens in your mini-world must be connected back down to the Game that everyone understands if you want to have any hope of others beyond your inner circle understanding.\n\nIn college, I was always focused on the “ right ” path for success. I obsessed over getting the right look, the right steps, the right itemized list of experience, the right passions and the right introductions and the right overall impression of a “professional” up-and-coming engineer. Life was one big plan for me, and I planned the hell out of being in the right places at the right times to get what I wanted. When I started my full-time job, I noticed that I felt surprisingly lighter. I no longer had a rigid plan telling me what to do at every moment. It was as if I was suddenly adrift, where before I had been anchored to an area for “proper” behavior. The depth of the world I was perceiving suddenly seemed to multiply, as if I had an improper prescription before and everything now was dramatically sharper, clearer. It was too much detail—too much choice for me too soon. I was used to knowing what the “right” thing was for any given moment and now I had to start deciding that for myself anew. A blank slate to start over a completely new plan from, but I stopped myself from falling into old habits. Before I was always chasing something new and far off. As soon as I achieved anything, it was on to the next. A never-ending race to climb the never-ending ladder. I decided to ditch chasing in favor of feeling—following the energy in the given moment, having a constant pulse on what got me excited and having it be enough to just feel passionate for my current situation.\n\nI’m grateful for where I’ve landed after this internal turmoil. Every day, I’m learning and remixing ideas and following the energy to new pastures and cultivating old gardens. I’m tuning my nose for what makes me really go off and the kinds of people where it feels as natural as breathing to riff off each other and build each other up. These are probably the closest things we have to a perpetual motion machine, a phenomenon where putting more energy in only produce more energy for you to go off. I want to intimately understand the things that I can work endlessly on, the kinds of things that make you giddy with excitement and anxious to get cracking. I’m okay making the leap to forge my own path and taking the trail off the beaten path. Especially given that I’m in a position to do so with the tech industry’s abundant offering of a good lifestyle, it almost feels like it would be a waste for me not to when so many people are otherwise constrained from making this choice themselves by the harshness of reality.\n\nI think the main reason we dread the mid-twenties is we fear the loss of our youth. But when I’m tuning into this energy and acting as the vehicle for its release, I feel like I’m on cloud nine, a state of flow beyond the trite conceptions of who gets to act excited and youthful. Even as I go into my mid-twenties and late twenties, through the roaring 20s to the bustling 30s and the partying 60s and beyond, I want to keep finding this energy in old passions and new curiosities. I want to keep channeling that energy, letting it drive me into adventures and communities, and of course having fun with it all the way. If we are mindful of it, we can bring a little bit of our child selves, the crazy, reckless, foolish, silly pieces of our youth, with us til the very end. And I think he’s a pretty fun guy to keep around for a while.\n\nFor my official transition into the mid-twenties, I’m asking for recommendations. Would love to hear what’s on your mind and anything you’d like to share .\n\nI’m also starting a new experiment of writing mini-essays every day. Mini-essays meaning they concisely demonstrate a single principle and are lightly edited (if at all).\n\nMy goal for them is to be a forcing function for me to distill the ideas with some substance that I think about each day into a publicly digestible form, but not edited or polished enough to become a full-blown blog post to retain some of that rawness and decrease the barrier to releasing it into the digital ether. I was also inspired by visakanv’s “do 100 things” principle and the #30for30 movement to continually produce and make things. I’ve been doing this in private with my habit tracker but decided that creating a public artifact is better for creating learning exhaust . I want to be fairly regimented about getting 100 of these things out but don’t want to force myself to the point that it feels like a chore and I lose the joy of creating them. With that perspective in mind, I’d like to have 100 artifacts by the end of August.\n\nThis may feel like spam sometimes since it’s everyday so would love feedback on how the cadence feels (feel free to tell me it’s too frequent) and any other thoughts on the material.

on all levels - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/communication-on-all-levels?s=r","content":"communication on all levels\n\nHi! I’m doing a 10% off sale to celebrate one year of paid subscriptions. Most of my posts are paywalled now, so if you enjoy this Substack please consider subscribing! Thanks v much.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this tweet since I first saw it. When I examine my current and past relationships, it really does come down to this: all the good things are about the ability to communicate. All the bad things come down to the inability to bridge the gaps between us.\n\nTwo communication failures from my past: 1) I once had an ex who was more traditional and closed-off. I, as you might have gathered, am very open and explorative. That difference wasn’t a dealbreaker in and of itself, but when we had conflicts about it I always felt like we talked past each other. We were fundamentally speaking different languages. Neither of us could translate for the other. We were never able to argue in a way that led to a resolution: we simply gave up at some point, our minds unchanged. 2) I dated a guy for a while who was really afraid of me writing about him. (As you know, I like to write about my life). This also wasn’t a problem on its own, but when I tried to have a conversation about it (Would you ever be okay with me writing about you in an anonymized form?) he said, I can’t believe you would push me on this. You’re so immature. I knew then and there that I could never be with someone who could talk to me in that way: dismissive, judgmental, uninterested in understanding.\n\nBut all the best moments have also been about communication. Physical chemistry is a form of communication (sex as a way through the self, to the self). Mental chemistry too: I told someone I loved recently that I loved them because I was interested in all the places their mind could go—because those were the places that my mind also went. My friend said that when she first fell in love with her boyfriend there were three weeks they were late for work every single day because they would stay up until 6 AM talking, talking, talking in bed. My earliest definition of love was the euphoria of understanding and being understood, of your solitude cracking wide open.\n\nI think I’ve become a much better communicator over time, though I still have a long way to go. Isn’t that how it always is—the better you get, the more you see how you can improve? I spent so many years refusing to dig deeper because I was afraid I would freak someone out, afraid they would be scared away by my honesty. When I think back on that it makes me want to cry. Because I’ve lost so much time. Here’s what I know: I’ve never regretting asking, never regretted knowing more. Asking only accelerates the already-present ground truth of the relationship—either you two will be able to accept each other, or you won’t and it was always doomed. You might think that presenting the truth in a pretty way will change the outcome, but it won’t.\n\nI believe that when you love someone you should want to know them completely. When you refuse to ask questions, you’re choosing to not to know. It’s so sad to choose to turn away from the actual reality of someone you care about. Paraphrased from Drive My Car: I can handle the truth, no matter what it is. Not knowing is what’s scary.\n\nOnce I said to a boy: When I try to talk to you, when I ask for more explanations, I’m being utopian. Because I’m expressing my faith in the possibility that we could understand each other completely. And it’s so very hard to understand someone completely. I wouldn’t claim I’ve gotten there with anyone. But it’s the dream. I told my psychoanalyst that I often think about what Joan Didion wrote about her husband in The Year of Magical Thinking: I could not count the times during the average day when something would come up that I needed to tell him. This impulse did not end with his death. What ended was the possibility of his response. She goes on to quote C.S. Lewis:\n\n“I think I am beginning to understand why grief feels like suspense,” C. S. Lewis wrote after the death of his wife. “It comes from the frustration of so many impulses that had become habitual. Thought after thought, feeling after feeling, action after action, had H. for their object. Now their target is gone. I keep on through habit fitting an arrow to the string, then I remember and have to lay the bow down. So many roads lead thought to H. I set out on one of them. But now there’s an impassable frontierpost across it. So many roads once; now so many cul de sacs.”\n\nThat’s love, right? So many roads of thought lead to you. Having them makes me feel less lonely.\n\nI also do an advice column! If you have questions, please feel free to ask me them here .\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

In this installment I write a bit about burnout, exhaustion, and rest. It doesn’t end with any neat solutions, but that’s kind of the point. However, I’ll take up the theme again in the next installment, and will hopefully end on a more promising note.\n\nAs many of you know, the newsletter operates on a patronage model. The writing is public, there is no paywall, but I welcome the support of readers who value the work. Not to be too sentimental about it, but thanks to those who have become paying subscribers this newsletter has become a critical part of how I make my living. And for that I’m very grateful. Recently, a friend inquired about one-time gifts as the year draws to a close, however this platform doesn’t allow that option. So for those who would like to support the Convivial Society but for whom the usual subscription rates are a bit too steep, here’s a 30% discounted option that works out to about $31 for the year or about $2.50 a month. The option is good through the end of December. Cheers!\n\nSeveral years ago, I listened to Terry Gross interview the son of a prominent religious leader, who had publicly broken with his father’s legacy and migrated to another, rather different branch of the tradition. Gross asked why he had not simply let his faith go altogether. His reply has always stuck with me. He explained that it was, in part, because he was the kind of person whose first instinct, upon deciding to become an atheist, would be to ask God to help him be an atheist.\n\nI thought about his response recently when I encountered an article with the following title: “The seven types of rest: I spent a week trying them all. Could they help end my exhaustion?”\n\nMy first, admittedly ill-tempered reaction was to conclude that Betteridge’s Law had been validated once again. In case this is the first time you’re hearing of Betteridge’s Law, it states that any headline ending in a question can be answered with no. I think you’ll find that it holds more often than not.\n\nWith the opening anecdote in mind, my second, slightly more considered response was to conclude that some of us have become the kind of people whose first instinct, upon deciding to break loose from the tyranny of productivity and optimization, would be to make a list. Closely related to this thought was another: some of us have become the kind of people whose first instinct, upon deciding to reject pathological consumerism, would be to buy a product or service which promised to help us do so.\n\nAnd I don’t think we should necessarily bracket the religious context of the original formulation in the latter two cases. The structure is altogether analogous: a certain pattern of meaning, purpose, and value has become so deeply engrained that we can hardly imagine operating without it. This is why the social critic Ivan Illich called assumptions of this sort “certainties” and finally concluded that they needed to be identified and challenged before any meaningful progress on social ills could be made.\n\nAs it turned out, that article on the different forms of rest takes a recent book as its point of departure. The book identified and explored the seven forms of rest—physical, emotional, mental, social, and so on—which the author of the article sampled for a day a piece. Probably not what the book’s author had in mind. Whatever one makes of the article, or the book upon which it is based, the problem to which it speaks, a sense of permanent burnout or chronic exhaustion, is, as far as I can tell, real and pervasive, and it is a symptom of a set of interlocking disorders afflicting modern society, which have been exacerbated and laid bare over the last two years.\n\nOthers have written about this phenomenon perceptively and eloquently, particularly if we consider discussions of rest, exhaustion, and burnout together with similar discussions about the changing nature and meaning of work. The writing of Jonathan Malesic and Anne Helen Petersen comes immediately to mind. I won’t do the matter justice in the way they and others do, but this is a subject I’ve been thinking about a good bit lately so I’ll offer some brief observations for your consideration.\n\nAnd I think I’ll break these reflections up into two or three posts beginning with this one. As I think about what we might variously describe as the exhaustion, fatigue, or burnout that characterizes our experience, several obvious sources come to mind, chief among them economic precarity and a global pandemic. The persistent mental and emotional tax we pay to use social media doesn’t help, of course. But my attention is drawn to another set of factors: a techno-economic milieu that is actively hostile to human well-being, for example, or a certain programmed aimlessness that may undermine the experience of accomplishment or satisfaction. So let me take aim at that first point in this installment and turn to the second in a forthcoming post.\n\nLet’s start by acknowledging that we’re talking about a longstanding problem, which likely varies in intensity from time to time. I’ve mentioned on more than a few occasions that the arc of digital culture bends toward exhaustion, but it does so as part of a much longer cultural trajectory. Here’s another passage that has stayed with me years after first encountering it. It is from Patrick Leigh Fermor’s A Time To Keep Silent, the famed travel writer’s account of his stays at several monasteries across Europe and Turkey circa 1950. Early on, Fermor recounted the physical effects of his first stay in a monastery after recently having been in Paris. “The most remarkable preliminary symptoms,” Fermor began, “were the variations of my need of sleep.” “After initial spells of insomnia, nightmare and falling asleep by day,” he continues,\n\nI found that my capacity for sleep was becoming more and more remarkable: till the hours I spent in or on my bed vastly outnumbered the hours I spent awake; and my sleep was so profound that I might have been under the influence of some hypnotic drug. For two days, meals and the offices in the church — Mass, Vespers and Compline — were almost my only lucid moments. Then began an extraordinary transformation: this extreme lassitude dwindled to nothing; night shrank to five hours of light, dreamless and perfect sleep, followed by awakenings full of energy and limpid freshness.\n\nIf your experience is anything like mine, that last line will be the most unrelatable bit of prose you’ll read today. So to what did Fermor attribute this transformation? “The explanation is simple enough:” he writes,\n\nthe desire for talk, movements and nervous expression that I had transported from Paris found, in this silent place, no response or foil, evoked no single echo; after miserably gesticulating for a while in a vacuum, it languished and finally died for lack of any stimulus or nourishment. Then the tremendous accumulation of tiredness, which must be the common property of all our contemporaries, broke loose and swamped everything. No demands, once I had emerged from that flood of sleep, were made upon my nervous energy: there were no automatic drains, such as conversation at meals, small talk, catching trains, or the hundred anxious trivialities that poison everyday life. Even the major causes of guilt and anxiety had slid away into some distant limbo and not only failed to emerge in the small hours as tormentors but appeared to have lost their dragonish validity.”\n\nThere’s a lot that’s worth lingering over in that paragraph—how digital devices have multiplied the automatic drains, for example—but I want to focus our attention on this one phrase: “the tremendous accumulation of tiredness, which must be the common property of all our contemporaries.”\n\nNow there’s a relatable sentiment. I emphasize it only to make the point that while, as Petersen wrote in a 2019 essay , burnout may be the “permanent residence” of the millennial generation, it can also be characterized as a more recent iteration of a longstanding condition. And the reason for this is that the dominant techno-social configuration of modern society demands that human beings operate at a scale and pace that is not conducive to their well-being—let alone rest, rightly understood—but by now most of us have been born into this state of affairs and take it more or less for granted.\n\nFor example, in a recent installment of her newsletter, Petersen discussed how existing social and economic structures make it so we always pay, in one way or another, for taking time to rest, and, of course, that’s if we are among those who are fortunate enough to do so. In the course of her discussion she makes the following pointed observation:\n\nThe ideal worker, after all, is a robot. A robot never tires, never needs rest, requires only the most basic of maintenance. When or if it collapses, it is readily replicated and replaced. In 24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep , Jonathan Crary makes the haunting case that we’re already training our bodies for this purpose. The more capable you are of working without rest of any form — the more you can convince your body and yourself to labor as a robot — the more valuable you become within the marketplace. We don’t turn off so much as go into “sleep mode”: ready, like the machines we’ve forced our bodies to approximate, to be turned back on again.\n\nThis is yet another example of the pattern I sought to identify in a recent installment: the human-built world is not built for humans . In that essay, I was chiefly riffing on Illich, who argued that “contemporary man attempts to create the world in his image, to build a totally man-made environment, and then discovers that he can do so only on the condition of constantly remaking himself to fit it.”\n\nIllich is echoing the earlier work of the French polymath Jacques Ellul, to whom Illich acknowledged his debt in a 1994 talk I’ve cited frequently. In his best known book, The Technological Society , Ellul argued that by the early 20th century Western societies had become structurally inhospitable to human beings because technique had become their ordering principle. These days I find it helpful to gloss what technique meant for Ellul as the tyrannical imperative to optimize everything.\n\nSo, recall Petersen’s observation about the robot being the ideal worker. It’s a remarkably useful illustration of Ellul’s thesis. It’s not that any one technology has disordered the human experience of work. Rather, it’s that technique, the ruthless pursuit of efficiency or optimization, as an ordering principle has determined how specific technologies and protocols are to be developed and integrated into the work environment. The resulting system, reflecting the imperatives of technique, is constructed in such a way that the human being qua human being becomes an impediment, a liability to the functioning of the system. He or she must become mechanical in their performance in order to fit the needs of the system, be it a warehouse floor or a byzantine bureaucracy. It’s the Taylorite fantasy of scientific management now abetted by a vastly superior technical apparatus. The logic, of course, finally suggests the elimination of the human element. When we design systems that work best the more machine-like we become, we shouldn’t be surprised when the machines ultimately render us superfluous.\n\nBut only under certain circumstances can the human element be eliminated. For the most part, we carry on in techno-social environments that are either indifferent to a certain set of genuine human needs or altogether hostile to them. For this reason, Ellul argued, a major subset of technique emerges. Ellul referred to these as human techniques because their aim was to continually manage the human element in the technological system so that it would function adequately.\n\n“In order that he not break down or lag behind (precisely what technical progress forbids),” Ellul believed, “[man] must be furnished with psychic forces he does not have in himself, which therefore must come from elsewhere.” That “elsewhere” might be pharmacology, propaganda, or, to give some more recent examples, mindfulness apps or seven techniques for finding rest.\n\nis ill at ease in this strange new environment, and the tension demanded of him weighs heavily on his life and being. He seeks to flee—and tumbles into the snare of dreams; he tries to comply and falls into the life of organizations; he feels maladjusted—and becomes a hypochondriac. But the new technological society has foresight and ability enough to anticipate these human reactions. It has undertaken, with the help of techniques of every kind, to make supportable what was not previously so, and not, indeed, by modifying anything in man's environment but by taking action upon man himself.\n\nIn his view, human techniques are alway undertaken in the interest of preserving the system and adapting the human being to its demands. Ellul explained the problem at length, but here’s a relatively condensed expression of the argument:\n\n[W]e hear over and over again that there is ‘something out of line’ in the technical system, an insupportable state of affairs for a technician. A remedy must be found. What is out of line? According to the usual superficial analysis, it is man that is amiss. The technician thereupon tackles the problem as he would any other […] Technique reveals its essential efficiency in discerning that man has a sentimental and moral life which can have great influence on his material behavior and in proposing to do something about such factors on the basis of its own ends. These factors are, for technique, human and subjective; but if means can be found to act upon them, to rationalize them and bring them into line, they need not be a technical drawback. Of course, man as such does not count.\n\nOne recurring rejoinder to critiques of new or emerging technologies, particularly when it is clear that they are unsettling existing patterns of life for some, usually those with little choice in the matter, is to claim that human beings are remarkably resilient and adaptable. The fact that this comes off as some sort of high-minded compliment to human nature does a lot of work, too. But this claim tells us very little of merit because it does not address the critical issue: is it good for human beings to adapt to the new state of affairs. After all, as Ellul noted, human beings can be made to adapt to all manner of inhumane conditions, particularly in wartime. The fact that they do so may be to the credit of those who do, but not necessarily to the circumstances to which they must adapt. From this perspective, praise of humanity’s adaptability can look either like a bit of propaganda or, more generously, a case of Stockholm syndrome.\n\nSo let’s come back to where we started with Ellul’s insights in mind. There are two key points. First, our exhaustion—in its various material and immaterial dimensions—is a consequence of the part we play in a techno-social milieu whose rhythms, scale, pace, and demands are not conducive to our well-being, to say nothing of the well-being of other creatures and the planet we share. Second, the remedies to which we often turn may themselves be counterproductive because their function is not to alter the larger system which has yielded a state of chronic exhaustion but rather to keep us functioning within it. Moreover, not only do the remedies fail to address the root of the problem, but there’s also a tendency to carry into our efforts to find rest the very same spirit which animates the system that left us tired and burnt out. Rest takes on the character of a project to be completed or an experience to be consumed. In neither case do we ultimately find any sort of meaningful and enduring relief or renewal.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

or Just Surveilled?: Tawana Petty on the Fight Against Facial Recognition Surveillance","link":"https://logicmag.io/security/safe-or-just-surveilled-tawana-petty-on-facial-recognition","content":"Safe or Just Surveilled?: Tawana Petty on the Fight Against Facial Recognition Surveillance\n\nOrganizers across the US have been building a movement to ban police use of facial recognition technology. To date, they have won municipal-level bans in San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley, as well as in Somerville, MA; however, the struggle against surveillance technology continues elsewhere.\n\nWe talked to Tawana “Honeycomb” Petty about what that fight looks like in Detroit, a majority-Black city where global capitalism and municipal disinvestment have left many Black residents below the poverty line. For decades she’s worked in the lineage of James and Grace Lee Boggs and other community anti-racist organizers to remind Detroit residents that Black abundance and safety existed before and are possible again.\n\nToday, Petty organizes against surveillance technologies in Detroit as the director of the Data Justice Program for Detroit Community Technology Project. She also co-leads Our Data Bodies, a five-person team that raises consciousness in marginalized communities about how digital information is collected, stored, and shared by governments and corporations. She is a convening member of the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition, which organizes “Data DiscoTechs” and other initiatives to foster media and digital literacy.\n\nThe work is all interconnected. How do you equip residents with what they need to demand what’s best for them and their communities? Whether helping people to understand surveillance, advocating for inclusion in the first digital Census, or navigating government benefits, Tawana’s work with community members focuses on education, organizing, and agency in the pursuit of digital justice in Detroit and beyond.\n\nWe sat down with Tawana in January 2020 to talk about the fight against facial recognition, building data agency within systems meant to strip it, and what’s at stake in what she calls “the last Black mecca” in the United States.\n\nTo start us off, could you tell us about yourself, your background, and how you came to work with the Detroit Community Technology Project?\n\nI'm Tawana Petty, also known as Honeycomb. I’m a poet, a mom, a social justice organizer, and a water rights advocate. I direct the Data Justice program for Detroit Community Technology Project (DCTP), and through DCTP I convene the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition.\n\nRight now, one of the Data Justice Program's main initiatives is slowing down the rapid expansion of Project Green Light, which is a public-private partnership around facial recognition technology spearheaded by the Detroit Police Department (DPD). We're also creating educational resources about technology, surveillance, and equitable participation in the Census. During the time that Project Green Light was ramping up, DCTP was involved in a research project called Our Data Bodies, which I can tell you more about later.\n\nWhen Project Green Light got started, we had no concept of the scope of surveillance it would take on. The project gets its name from flashing green lights that are connected to video surveillance cameras inside and outside of different businesses. The cameras are monitored twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, at DPD’s real-time crime centers and mobile devices.\n\nIt started off with cameras at eight gas stations—ones that stayed open during late night hours. The police wanted to use these cameras to signal to community members that the gas stations were now safe to enter at any time, because police were constantly going to be watching them. They partnered with two private companies on this project: Guardian Alarm and Comcast.\n\nFast forward a couple of years. We now have close to six hundred cameras all over Detroit, and the Mayor would like to push that number to 4,000. Project Green Light locations pay a monthly rate so that if something happens at that location, they get priority from police over non–Green Light locations. So they pay for policing. And then, of course, the DPD leadership signed a contract to use facial recognition on everything from drones, traffic lights, mobile devices—pretty much anything they could attach a surveillance camera to. They were using that facial recognition technology on footage from their Green Lights for about two years before social justice activists and technologists in the city really got wind of it, when DPD tried to push through a directive that would solidify their use of it. Before that proposal, there was no policy governing its use.\n\nWhat did the rollout of Project Green Light look like within the community, and how did you start to organize folks against it?\n\nThe police really tapped into this negative narrative that has hovered over Detroit for decades. They were touting Project Green Light as the salvation of the city, like, “Hey, we have the answer. We know you are all afraid of each other, so we're going to give you all these security cameras, and you’re going to feel safe because we're always going to be watching you.”\n\nThe police department’s campaign targeted senior citizens mostly—the ones who are retired or sitting at home, inundated with media images. They didn't hide the idea of putting cameras everywhere like they later hid their adoption of facial recognition. In fact, they were trying to separate the two ideas, saying that Project Green Light was different than facial recognition. But the two systems needed each other; the city needed to overhaul itself with all these surveillance cameras in order to make facial recognition a viable system. The DPD just kept saying, “Facial recognition is not embedded within the cameras,” and, “We'll only use the facial recognition if we absolutely have to.” Meanwhile, they were proposing policy directives that were asking for real-time live tracking on mobile devices, drones, traffic lights, and more.\n\nInitially, when we were showing up to meetings at the Board of Police Commissioners, there were a lot of residents, mostly senior citizens, who were really angry with us. They felt that we were getting in the way of a system that would make them safe, and that we were attacking police because we just wanted to cause trouble. In reality, we were just trying to educate residents, law enforcement, and the Board of Police Commissioners on the harms of mass surveillance and facial recognition. Over time, we were able to argue that facial recognition and Project Green Light needed each other to work the way that DPD leadership and city government wanted them to work, and you couldn’t have one without the other. We were also able to make the case that safety and surveillance were not synonymous.\n\nWas your resistance mainly organized around police commission meetings? How else did you all create pressure?\n\nWe spoke at police commission meetings and town halls. We collaborated on a special surveillance issue of a magazine called Riverwise , where we brought together information about Project Green Light, the problems with facial recognition, and alternatives that would create actual safety. We also created a report, “ A Critical Summary of Detroit’s Project Green Light and its Greater Context .”\n\n“Green Chairs, Not Green Lights” is our counter-campaign. We’re encouraging community members to come back to their front porches and look out for each other. We’re raising consciousness and building real safety, and we’re saying that a system set up to prioritize profits and institutions over people is wrong.\n\nI imagine you all are working in coalition with many different groups in this campaign. What are those different groups? Also, there’s a long history of activism and in particular Black-led activism in Detroit. How do you and the rest of the coalition situate yourselves within that history?\n\nYeah, absolutely. In addition to serving as director of the Data Justice Program here at DCTP, I'm also on the board of the James and Grace Lee Boggs Center to Nurture Community Leadership. James and Grace Lee Boggs are now ancestors, and a long legacy countering these sorts of things was created under their expert tutelage. [ Eds.: James and Grace Lee Boggs were revolutionaries who worked to dismantle capitalism and racist oppression nationally and through fostering community-based, grassroots activism within their adopted home city of Detroit.] Our former Boggs Center board member Ron Scott, who is also now an ancestor, co-founded the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, which still exists. I'm part of the Black Out Green Light Coalition and Green Light Black Futures coalition, which is organized by Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100). I also collaborate with the Detroit Justice Center, Media Justice, Color of Change, and Fight for the Future. Finally, I'm part of a lot of coalition work with the ACLU that collaborates with dozens of organizations that have been consistently resisting mass surveillance in the city.\n\nUltimately, we were unsuccessful in getting DPD to stop using facial recognition, but we did have some wins within the policy that the Board of Police Commissioners ultimately passed. We're definitely tuned in, which is why I think we were able to achieve any policy changes at all, even if what we wanted was a ban. Honestly, getting any of those changes in a city with this many Black people took a tremendous amount of work and was an uphill battle. All the other cities that were successful with bans were predominately white. Folks aren't as eager to take the ever-watching eye off of a predominately Black city.\n\nCould you tell me about those changes and what the policy looks like now?\n\nUnder the new policy, the police are prohibited from using facial recognition on any live feeds. Even though still photos are also very problematic, the thought that DPD would have been able to track people's faces as they walk the streets was very unnerving. So they're not able to do that. DPD can only use facial recognition to investigate violent crimes. They're barred from using it for immigration enforcement. They're barred from predictive analysis—using the technology for pre-crime, essentially. They're barred from mobile use, so they're not able to use their mobile devices to walk through crowds and track people using facial recognition, which is something that happened in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray protests. They're barred from violating the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments—freedom of religion, prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure, and due process under the law. Now, I'll tell you that I don't believe that's even possible—I think if you mass surveill a city, there's no way you're not going to violate those amendments.\n\nThe Board of Police Commissioners receives a weekly report on how the police are using facial recognition. Unfortunately, the Board of Police Commissioners, which is supposed to be a civilian oversight body, hasn't been very transparent with those reports. None of them have been made accessible to the public. They don’t even question the contents of the reports when they are handed them in meetings, at least not any of the Board of Police Commissioners meetings I have been present at. It's discouraging.\n\nMost significantly in the policy, Detroit police officers are supposed to be criminally investigated if they misuse the technology. Their misuse is supposed to be reported to the mayor, the Board of Police Commissioners, and the city council within twenty-four hours of discovery, which would lead to dismissal and further legal action.\n\nBut I would say that our greatest accomplishment was raising the consciousness of the city residents. Many, many residents were engaged in a process that, at first, they were just going along with.\n\nHow did you do that?\n\nFor several months, we gave testimony at every Board of Police Commissioner meeting that involved the topic. Unfortunately, residents are only afforded two minutes to speak, even on topics as dire as this one. We leveraged our minutes to push forward a vision of people sitting on their front porches, the community having good schools, affordable water that doesn't contain lead, neighbors not getting evicted, neighborhood block clubs. We pushed for senior citizens to think about the times when they felt safe, and whether or not being held up in their homes under surveillance cameras actually made them safe.\n\nThat understanding of safety was the scaffolding. And once we had that, we could build on it. We could say: what the police department is talking about is security ; it’s not what you’re thinking of when you’re thinking about safety .\n\nIt really was a slow educational process, to be honest with you—constantly bringing materials and giving testimony. We’d bring examples of conversations we’d had with children, where we'd ask them a question like, “Say you lived on a street. On side A of that street, there were metal gates and cameras and drones and police. And on side B, there were a bunch of neighbors who knew each other, who looked out for each other, who knew that if John didn't come home at 7:00 p.m., then they should probably find out where John is. On which side of the street would you feel safest?” Kids almost always said, “How could I feel safe if I don't know the people who live next to me, you know?” That same type of teaching works with adults when they started to think it through.\n\nWe also began bringing in the data around how facial recognition technology misidentifies darker skin tones in women and children , and how Detroit is 80 percent Black . We started reflecting back what DPD leadership themselves were actually saying. For example, DPD leadership indicated that of the 500 times over two years that they used facial recognition, they only moved forward with 150 cases, because the other 350 were misidentifications by the system.\n\nWe highlighted the fact that they were telling us the system was wrong at least 350 times and that they were relying on the naked eye of two analysts to catch the errors of the algorithm. This caused great concern about the potential of false arrests. So, we dissect what's being said and present that back to people consistently.\n\nYou’ve mentioned how Detroit is 80 percent Black, a stark contrast to other, primarily white cities that have banned facial recognition. How does your fight in Detroit look different from the fight in whiter cities like San Francisco or Boston?\n\nWe've built relationships with organizers in pretty much all the other places that have successfully banned facial recognition, including Portland, where folks are pushing for the most comprehensive ban. We've consistently told them: we need to synthesize what you all have done, but also apply a racial lens to it because it's going to be much harder to convince not just Detroiters but the world that a Black city doesn't need to be surveilled. It's a deeper, larger conversation and it requires a kind of organizing around anti-Black racism that often isn’t comfortable to do even in social justice or liberal spaces.\n\nThat’s why I value the consciousness-raising piece so much. I really want to win this, but I also have to find some value in the fact that we've been able to raise the consciousness of people all across the US who now consider themselves invested in our struggle. So I take pieces from all the places that I've been able to visit and all the people that we've been able to talk to. But I also understand that there is a very real dynamic here that does not exist in cities that only have a 5 percent Black population.\n\nOne of the things that I've consistently said is that Detroit is the last remaining Black mecca in the United States. If we don't succeed in resisting some of this violent system, there is no hope for Black residents across the rest of the country, period. Police departments have already tried to model this system in other cities—calling them Project Blue Light in Wisconsin, for example. They're just packaging up what city government is pushing through in Detroit. On any given day here, you can see drones flying through the sky like kites.\n\nWow, that's an apocalyptic vision. In past talks, you’ve talked about the rise of surveillance and how that ties in with the “resurgence” of the city, as money floods into gentrified areas like downtown and Corktown. Could you give a little bit of that historical context in Detroit?\n\nThere are areas of Detroit like Black Bottom and Paradise Valley that had Black hospitals, Black grocery stores and schools, and African-centered education—all these viable institutions—that were leveled for freeways. One of our challenges is getting folks to think about a time in the city when there was an abundance of thriving neighborhoods that were predominantly Black-owned, -led, and -invested.\n\nI’m always trying to point out the inaccuracy of the narrative that Detroiters just don't want to care for where they live, they don't want safe neighborhoods, they don't want viable institutions—that the system that we exist under is a choice . We're in a city with five hundred thousand Black people and the median household income here is $29,000 a year —which means that half the households in the city make less than that. Predominantly Black women-led households. Lots of children in extreme poverty. One hundred thousand people without water in their homes over the last ten years . Schools closed by the hundreds . I work to get people to see crystal clear that this isn't an accidental situation. It’s easy to convince anybody in the state of Michigan and the world that if something bad is happening to Detroit, we brought it on ourselves. There isn't a dissecting of how we got here, or the history of racism and the disinvestment that has happened for generations, you know?\n\nAt the beginning of our conversation, you mentioned the Our Data Bodies project. I understand the project is led by a five-person team that includes three organizers from different groups: the Center for Community Transitions in Charlotte, which focuses on folks who have recently reentered the community from incarceration; the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, which organizes against police surveillance in Los Angeles; and you all at DCTP. How did those three organizations come together?\n\nOur Data Bodies was initially a two-year research project between Detroit, Charlotte, and Los Angeles. We were thinking about the digital streams we all produce and the impacts that our information has on our interactions with government and police, on how we get resources, and on how our cities are developed. Within those two years, we learned that we wanted to move beyond a research project and expand on our organizing within our communities to increase self-determination around these systems.\n\nThe three organizers—Mariella Saba, Tamika Lewis, and I—all originally applied for our positions on the project. The interview committee was very intentional in picking social justice organizers for these roles as researchers because the type of analysis that comes from organizing on the ground in the neighborhood was going to be important in making sure that we were prioritizing community members. That won’t happen if you just focus on having a good researcher. Research is something that can be taught; care and compassion for the people connected to the research is a longer process.\n\nSo we all play to our strengths. I consider Stop LAPD Spying a mentor in this work, especially in resisting police and surveillance systems. For this project, Stop LAPD Spying and Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN) put a lot of emphasis on unhoused populations and how Skid Row is a heavily targeted community that the LAPD uses to innovate new surveillance systems.\n\nIn Charlotte, Tamika does work around citizens returning from incarceration. Folks returning from incarceration constantly have to report back to the system. It's like the system is constantly waiting for you to fail. Tamika also brings an important perspective as a gender-nonconforming organizer: they understand how resistance to being defined under the dominate gender binary makes people targets for intensified surveillance.\n\nHow have you been able to make use of that experience and research?\n\nWe’ve collectively produced materials like our Digital Defense Playbook , which is an educational resource and activity guide about data, surveillance, and safety that we created last year based on our three years of community research. We’ve taken that work to different neighborhood institutions, as well as academia. We’ve worked with data scientists, who are often disconnected from the real people represented by the statistics they analyze.\n\nWe're all learning from each other and staying in constant communication about what's happening in our different cities, and hearing the same themes. Things like, “The one mistake that I've made in my life is now the thing that's limiting how I'm able to survive.” Or, “I'm feeling heavily surveilled because I'm trans,” or “I'm feeling super targeted because my credit isn't good,” or “I've just reentered society from incarceration and I feel like every move that I make is being scrutinized and monitored.” Across all the cities, community members wanted to be seen for something more than a mistake they made, or something more than their data. And they didn't want to be pursued and tracked and monitored.\n\nWhat exactly is a “data body”? Recently, we’ve seen the rise of various tools that let you see the data that companies have about you. But your approach seems more holistic. It’s not just, does Facebook have this data about me, but what are all of the different pieces of data that the government or private companies might have—and what am I able to do about it?\n\nWe try to get community members to think not just about the impact that their data has on them, but the impact that their data has on the decisions that affect their family, their neighborhood, and their city.\n\nOne of our exercises is called “What’s in Your Wallet?” As part of that exercise, we often use the example of a person who uses their EBT card at the liquor store up the street and purchases foods that aren't considered healthy. Those activities create a data trail. Maybe a bank will look at those data trails and decide not to invest in a grocery store in that neighborhood. It's difficult to know exactly how some decisions are made, but what we do know is that data is leveraged to make most of those decisions.\n\nThat’s what we mean by data bodies. It’s not just the individual; it's the information that's been generated about this individual and the systems that interact to make decisions about this individual, this individual's family, this individual's neighborhood—all the data’s tentacles.\n\nIn the Digital Defense Playbook, you cite a conversation with a community member who says about interacting with government agencies, \"For their benefit they do communicate. But for my benefit, no.\" And I see this a lot in government work—if agencies want to communicate to surveil and penalize, then they can and will. But if you want them to share information to, say, verify that you’ve lost your job so that you can get food stamps, they often can’t or won’t.\n\nIt seems like so much of your work with Our Data Bodies is trying to build data agency within a system where power is skewed heavily towards other organizations or towards the state. How do you help people build data agency to overcome that power imbalance?\n\nOne of the things that we truly, clearly recognize within our work is that the power is going to come from the respiriting of community members. A lot of folks have been really dehumanized. There’s a quote that says, “Friendship begins at the moment when one person says to another, ‘What, you too? I thought I was the only one.’” And so it’s been this weaving together of stories to let community members know that they're not alone.\n\nIt’s saying: did you know that there is an open data portal in your city and that you can push for that to become a useful source of information? Or: did you know that you can request to have some of your information deleted from a government database? It’s letting people know: here's how these systems connect and interact with one another. It’s an ongoing process of learning how different people are experiencing these systems, but also tying them together with the stories of others so that they understand they aren’t isolated, that there are many people across the world resisting these systems.\n\nWe intentionally did not publish everything in the Digital Defense Playbook. There are stories that community members shared with us that emphasize how they're resisting systems that we did not share, which contradicts everything that a capitalist system would ask you to do. It's like, why not put it all out there? Well, because we actually want people to keep surviving.\n\nThe Digital Defense Playbook serves as a community organizing mechanism where we get to talk to people, we get to share stories, we get to respirit, we get to raise digital and media literacy. We don't think that it solves all the things. But we do think that when you build the confidence of community members, and you let them know that they're not alone, and that there are folks that are resisting these things all over, it does something for the spirit. So that's how we use it.\n\nLike Our Data Bodies, the Data DiscoTechs organized by the Detroit Digital Justice Coalition seem like they aim to raise consciousness and agency around data within communities. Could you paint a picture of one for me?\n\nThe “discovering technology” fairs, which we refer to as DiscoTechs, are kind of like a science fair at school—you know, with informational stations on different topics. To start one, we either respond to folks who have reached out to us or pick a neighborhood where we want to do one. We connect with an organizer or resident who lives in that neighborhood, who has the pulse of what's happening, and we support them in finding out what stations they think might most benefit their neighborhood.\n\nWe start with a few stations that we definitely want to have. Recently, we’ve had stations where we’re telling community members what to expect with the census. What kinds of things get funded based on census data? What are some of the concerns that have been raised about the census? How has it been used in the past? How long is census data kept? We did research to empower community members with that information.\n\nBut then the rest of the eight or nine stations are designed around what the community says they need. So they might say, well, in this neighborhood, it's a lot of senior citizens. They don't understand Twitter, they don't understand how to set up an email account, they just want to learn how to use a Mac—things like that. So then those are the stations that we will have. Community members are able to come in for free. We have music. We call it a DiscoTech, but it also has music and dance. At the last two, we gave away low-cost computers: the Raspberry Pi full kit, with the keyboard and everything. We gave those to residents who don't have that technology at home.\n\nWho shows up to those DiscoTechs? Mostly young folks? Is it a mix of ages, of races?\n\nIt definitely depends where we have them. Some neighborhoods are predominantly senior citizens, so we'll have a lot of seniors show up. When we did one in southwest Detroit, it was a predominately Spanish-speaking undocumented community, so we had interpreters onsite, including youth interpreters. It was great. Those stations had mostly young and middle-age participants.\n\nI’m curious about the print magazine that you help produce, Riverwise . How are you involved? How did it come to be?\n\nI think it's the poet in me, but I don't remember a point in my life where I didn't feel obligated to push back against the dominant narrative of Detroit. I'm pretty sure there was a time, but I don't remember it.\n\nThere was a newspaper in the city, the Michigan Citizen , that was trying to lift up community stories of resilience and resistance, countering the dominant narrative in the city. It was around for three decades, but then it ended. The Boggs Center felt that we had a responsibility to fill that void, or at least try to fill that void. And so we convened community members over a one-year period to see whether there was interest in trying to create consistent literature that would amplify community stories of resilience and resistance that would counter the narratives that were coming out of the city. Through those meetings, Riverwise was born. I am now part of the Riverwise Magazine Collective, and I serve on the editorial board. Eric Campbell, a former contributor to the Michigan Citizen is the managing editor. We put it out quarterly, and then we do some special editions, depending on what the situation is. That's how the special surveillance edition in collaboration with DCTP came about.\n\nWe convene weekly and go through stories that we've heard ourselves, or we've pursued folks who we want to write for us, or we have people who send in submissions. Then we determine whether we want to theme the magazine based on something that’s happening in the city, or if this is one where we're just going to lift up various stories. And then we have these community discussions around what's written in the magazine. If a person did an article or something for the magazine, then we'll ask them if they want to host a community discussion and we will support them in that. We also host writing workshops to support residents who want to improve their writing skills or learn how to contribute content to the magazine. It’s not our coalition that does most of the writing workshops. We tap people in the community—poets, writers, you know, organizers—who want to host those workshops and then we just support them.\n\nHow can people support the fight against facial recognition?\n\nThey can support organizations like Fight for the Future which are pushing for a federal ban on the government use of facial recognition. They could call or email their Congressperson. They can help us amplify our struggles.\n\nIn Michigan there are a few current bills that could use some support. There’s a bill in the State Senate, 2019 SB 0342, that's likely going to be passed. It was initially a ban on all police use of facial recognition, but now it's a ban on police use of real-time facial recognition . There was House Bill 4810, a five-year moratorium on the police use of facial recognition on everything—drones, body cameras, any surveillance technology—that’s still kind of lingering out there. And then there is the Community Input Over Government Surveillance ordinance that's before the Detroit City Council, which creates guidelines for council oversight and public input for surveillance technology. That one is currently being passed back and forth for amendments.\n\nOn the federal level, there's a Congressional bill called the No Biometric Barriers Housing Act of 2019 that bans the use of biometrics in public housing. There's also a bill out there called the Ethical Use of Facial Recognition Act that would prevent federal funding from being used for facial recognition technologies, including police and other government use. I’m not really sure what's going to stick beyond the Detroit city ordinance, though, and maybe the Michigan State Senate bill.\n\nBut wherever you are, you can support the fight by continuing to try to politicize your community, push for alternatives to surveillance, and minimize the conflation between surveillance and safety. And in Detroit, we'll just continue the work by showing how invasive and insidious this technology is—hopefully before we see a slew of false arrests. We don't want to be living in a social credit system, where our every move is dictated by algorithms and surveillance cameras.\n\nOr at least more than what we have already.\n\nExactly, yeah. It’s already a social credit system in Detroit, but we don't want to add more and more technologies to that and exacerbate the violence and marginalization that residents are already feeling. And we don't want this rolled out all across the globe as a way to contain and control Black and brown people and Indigenous people and poor white people. Surveillance is not safety.\n\nThe hardest part for us is that law enforcement, government institutions, and too many people don't seem to see an alternative, especially in areas that have been deemed dangerous. But everyone needs to understand that most crime in our neighborhoods is rooted in poverty and disinvestment and racial violence. We need co-liberators; we don't need any more allies. We need folks to really feel their liberation is tied up in our liberation, you know?\n\nTawana “Honeycomb” Petty is a mother, social justice organizer, youth advocate, poet, and author.

I recognize my crippling existentialism lurking in the corner—it seems satisfied staying in the shadows of my soul's home.\n\nI have a little reminder that shows me my notes \"on this day\" a year ago, which includes my reflection on the mid-twenties on turning 24. My existentialism was out and dancing then. My reflection reads as a winding wish list or a prayer litany. I'm free now and I want to use that freedom for the things I love. It feels like something you'd write at the cusp of a change, a piece of \"faking it\" that you write to convince yourself that you're different from who you are in the moment. As is my tendency, it ends on an optimistic note, but you can't help but feel like there's an undercurrent of yearning that is being covered up by hopeful placards.\n\nI watched Everything Everywhere All At Once (do yourself a favor and go watch it if you haven't seen it) the day after, which was fitting given the existential theme. Through a set of infinite consciousnesses, it tells the story of how humans can teeter between the edge of pure nihilism (nothing matters) and unstoppable kindness (this moment of kindness is all that matters) and arrives at a point of optimistic nihilism (every tender moment is worth fighting for, no matter how few or far between). It's beautiful, moving, funny, technically masterful as a work of film and acting, and it does so all to insist—lovingly, persistently, hysterically—that we matter for no reason of greatness other than being us and being here. We don't need to prove our worth to the world, to our infinitely more \"successful\" selves. The moment we're in—now, this very second is what matters to us. It's a message of hope, a call to arms for us to fight for the world we want to see. To fight with love and beauty and an appreciation for all the weird, peaceful, sublime moments of our lives. Fighting to gift these moments to others, seeking understanding, towards a more whole knowing of others.\n\nAt the turn of my quarter life, I'm feeling grateful, settled, hopeful—primed to fight for what I love and believe in.\n\nGrateful for all the love and inspiration and laughs and fun in the people that inhabit my life and the exchange of these invisible substances, winding their way through invisible trails connecting us.\n\nSettled in my pursuit of craft, how my passion ebbs and flows between hobbies in constant pursuit of creation and beauty and mediums for connection.\n\nHopeful for the flourishing of a world where we're all dreamers, and it isn't sad or conflicting to want to be and say you are one.\n\nI've been saying I'm not existential, but that's not quite true. I'm existential in the sense that I'm reflecting on living and being. People always associate being existential with a negative connotation, with questioning the meaning of everything and being unsettled by the silence that follows.\n\nCan you be hopeful and existential? I've been wondering how life can be so good, how beauty can be so ample, how passion can be so intense, how kindness can go so far, how laughter can echo so deeply, how a smile can turn around a day and a name can be the portal to a new world and a rambling reflection can be a lifeline in the dark. I'm thinking about how we can exist in a world that contains tender raindrops that slip down misty windows, billions of burning rocks that dutifully perform against the shawl of our universe, ladybugs that curiously creep up your finger, the way fresh vegetables share the history of their essence, seas that look like an oil painting, layers upon layers of contrasting gouache.\n\nI can't help but feel overwhelming love for the space we inhabit and stubborn hope for our agency to form societies that empower everyone to feel this way. That we will burn optimism as fuel for creating something better for our community. That we believe in our ability to make change and be fun and show love, even if just to ourselves.\n\nI hoped for all these things last year and somehow it feels like they have manifested in flesh and bits and neural activity. I'm doing the things I love, emotionally surrounded by people I love, growing in the ways I want. I don't think I'm perfect—awareness of my flaws is part of what I seek. But I wouldn't change anything I'm doing. I just want to keep going—towards mutualistic flourishing .\n\nI know I'm naive; I'm a dreamer. But maybe we should get our hopes up for things sometimes. Maybe we shouldn't dampen how we feel to avoid the possibility of disappointment. Maybe we should hope for and demand everything—ask for the world, the stars, and the ever-expanding universe for ourselves. Maybe naïveté is how we keep imagining in vivid colors, connecting with rich feelings, dreaming of diverse characters.\n\nEvery day I'm searching for perception. The ability to perceive as much of the rich detail that pervades every moment of my life. I don't want to shy away from who I am or what I like or how I feel or who I love. I don't want to avert my eyes from ugliness or sadness or absolute bat-shit craziness. Living is about experiencing it all. Being is about feeling the threads of energy that connect us all, your enemies and towering redwoods and adorable squirrels. Existing is about breathing in the fullness of every second. And I'll fight to breathe deeply every day, again, again, again.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

But there’s more to it than that. If you work quickly, the cost of doing something new will seem lower in your mind. So you’ll be inclined to do more.\n\nThe converse is true, too. If every time you write a blog post it takes you six months, and you’re sitting around your apartment on a Sunday afternoon thinking of stuff to do, you’re probably not going to think of starting a blog post, because it’ll feel too expensive.\n\nWhat’s worse, because you blog slowly, you’re liable to continue blogging slowly—simply because the only way to learn to do something fast is by doing it lots of times.\n\nThis is true of any to-do list that gets worked off too slowly. A malaise creeps into it. You keep adding items that you never cross off. If that happens enough, you might one day stop putting stuff onto the list.\n\nI’ve noticed that if I respond to people’s emails quickly, they send me more emails. The sender learns to expect a response, and that expectation spurs them to write. That is, speed itself draws emails out of them, because the projected cost of the exchange in their mind is low. They know they’ll get something for their effort. It’ll happen so fast they can already taste it.\n\nIt’s now well known on the web that slow server response times drive users away. A slow website feels broken. It frustrates the goer’s desire. Probably it deprives them of some dopaminergic reward.\n\nGoogle famously prioritized speed as a feature. They realized that if search is fast, you’re more likely to search. The reason is that it encourages you to try stuff, get feedback, and try again. When a thought occurs to you, you know Google is already there. There is no delay between thought and action, no opportunity to lose the impulse to find something out. The projected cost of googling is nil. It comes to feel like an extension of your own mind.\n\nIt is a truism, too, in workplaces, that faster employees get assigned more work. Of course they do. Humans are lazy. They want to preserve calories. And it’s exhausting merely thinking about giving work to someone slow. When you’re thinking about giving work to someone slow, you run through the likely quagmire in your head; you visualize days of halting progress. You imagine a resource—this slow person—tied up for awhile. It’s wearisome, even in the thinking. Whereas the fast teammate—well, their time feels cheap, in the sense that you can give them something and know they’ll be available again soon. You aren’t “using them up” by giving them work. So you route as much as you can through the fast people. It’s ironic: your company’s most valuable resources—because they finish things quickly—are the easiest to consume.\n\nThe general rule seems to be: systems which eat items quickly are fed more items. Slow systems starve.\n\nTwo more quick examples. What’s true of individual people turns out also to be true of whole organizations. If customers find out that you take two months to frame photos, they’ll go to another frame shop. If contributors discover that you’re slow to merge pull requests, they’ll stop contributing. Unresponsive systems are sad. They’re like buildings grown over with moss. They’re a kind of memento mori. People would rather be reminded of life. They’ll leave for places that get back to them quickly.\n\nEven now, I’m working in a text editor whose undo feature, for whatever reason, has suddenly become slow. It’s killing me. It disinclines me, for one thing, from undoing stuff. But it’s also probably subtly changing the way I work. I feel like I can’t rely on undo. So if I want to delete something but think I might want it later, I’m copying it to the bottom of the file, like it’s the 1980s. All this because undo is so slow that it might as well not exist. Undo, when it’s fast, is an incredible feature; at any moment, you can dip into the past, borrow something, and zip back. But now it feels like a dead end.\n\nPart of the activation energy required to start any task comes from the picture you get in your head when you imagine doing it. It may not be that going for a run is actually costly; but if it feels costly, if the picture in your head looks like a slog, then you will need a bigger expenditure of will to lace up.\n\nSlowness seems to make a special contribution to this picture in our heads. Time is especially valuable. So as we learn that a task is slow, an especial cost accrues to it. Whenever we think of doing the task again, we see how expensive it is, and bail.\n\nThe prescription must be that if there’s something you want to do a lot of and get good at—like write, or fix bugs—you should try to do it faster.\n\nThat doesn’t mean be sloppy. But it does mean, push yourself to go faster than you think is healthy. That’s because the task will come to cost less in your mind; it’ll have a lower activation energy. So you’ll do it more. And as you do it more (as long as you’re doing it deliberately ), you’ll get better. Eventually you’ll be both fast and good.\n\nBeing fast is fun. If you’re a fast writer, you’ll constantly be playing with new ideas. You won’t be bogged down in a single dread effort. And because your to-do list gets worked off, you’ll always be thinking of more stuff to add to it. With more drafts in the works, more of the world will pop alive . You will feel flexible and capable and practiced so that when something demanding and long arrives on your desk, you won’t back down afraid.\n\nNow, as a disclaimer, I should remind you of the rule that anyone writing a blog post advising against X is himself the worst Xer there is. At work, I have a history of painful languished projects, and I usually have the most overdue assignments of anyone on the team. As for writing, well, I have been working on this little blog post, on and off, no joke, for six years.","tokenFrequency":{"usual":1,"impuls":1,"broken":1,"organ":1,"desk":1,"websit":1,"spur":1,"better":1,"take":2,"doesn't":1,"put":1,"continu":1,"team":1,"priorit":1,"rather":1,"write":5,"calori":1,"fast":9,"consum":1,"shop":1,"email":3,"delay":1,"teammate—wel":1,"draft":1,"unit":1,"someon":2,"1980s":1,"world":1,"anoth":1,"back":3,"merg":1,"languish":1,"lazi":1,"probabl":3,"famous":1,"file":1,"day":2,"dead":1,"fun":1,"sunday":1,"slog":1,"especi":2,"special":1,"list":3,"exist":1,"bog":1,"human":1,"assign":2,"exhaust":1,"item":3,"onto":1,"month":2,"work":13,"build":1,"desir":1,"expenditur":1,"play":1,"go":4,"respond":1,"drive":1,"one":2,"won't":2,"obvious":1,"person—ti":1,"idea":1,"opportun":1,"thing":2,"must":1,"happen":2,"“use":1,"whenev":1,"part":1,"actual":1,"disclaim":1,"reason":2,"subt":1,"they'll":5,"rule":2,"imagin":2,"expect":2,"lose":1,"bail":1,"aliv":1,"overdu":1,"soon":1,"demand":1,"eat":1,"slowly—simpli":1,"enough":1,"request":1,"that":1,"deliber":1,"lower":2,"notic":1,"ad":1,"know":3,"malais":1,"sender":1,"occur":1,"sloppi":1,"post":4,"effort":2,"see":1,"new":2,"cost":7,"moment":1,"well":3,"tast":1,"known":1,"sad":1,"web":1,"slowli":2,"whose":1,"life":1,"inclin":1,"way":2,"cross":1,"year":1,"can't":1,"visual":1,"grown":1,"activ":2,"aren't":1,"requir":1,"get":9,"apart":1,"accru":1,"later":1,"workplac":1,"mean":2,"nil":1,"blog":6,"think":9,"i'm":2,"pop":1,"discov":1,"xer":1,"advis":1,"googl":3,"zip":1,"want":4,"i'v":1,"keep":1,"you'll":7,"finish":2,"up”":1,"whatev":1,"start":2,"run":2,"lot":2,"eventu":1,"bottom":1,"lace":1,"littl":1,"place":1,"respons":2,"individu":1,"cheap":1,"valuabl":2,"past":1,"exampl":1,"compani":1,"quickly—ar":1,"afternoon":1,"feedback":1,"writer":1,"action":1,"singl":1,"expens":2,"it'll":3,"employe":1,"wherea":1,"like":8,"alreadi":2,"two":2,"remind":2,"custom":1,"bugs—you":1,"even":2,"preserv":1,"time":6,"make":1,"you'r":8,"wors":1,"stuff":6,"worst":1,"benefit":1,"system":3,"task":4,"iron":1,"rout":1,"sens":1,"they'r":2,"learn":3,"prescript":1,"awhil":1,"much":1,"long":2,"come":3,"user":1,"give":4,"six":2,"feel":8,"mori":1,"contributor":1,"sudden":1,"true":4,"halt":1,"turn":1,"send":1,"incred":1,"also":2,"bigger":1,"speed":2,"quick":6,"chang":1,"leav":1,"may":1,"mind":4,"faster":3,"dip":1,"flexibl":1,"draw":1,"goer":1,"disinclin":1,"per":1,"end":1,"slow":11,"everi":1,"resources—becaus":1,"seem":3,"exchang":1,"general":1,"copi":1,"add":1,"easiest":1,"head":4,"depriv":1,"memento":1,"stop":2,"undo":5,"what":2,"constant":1,"good":2,"kill":1,"capabl":1,"starv":1,"never":1,"borrow":1,"tri":3,"text":1,"pain":1,"it":8,"featur":3,"contribut":2,"fix":1,"find":2,"pictur":3,"encourag":1,"would":1,"around":1,"convers":1,"fed":1,"arriv":1,"avail":1,"away":1,"someth":9,"afraid":1,"frame":2,"peopl":4,"project":3,"histori":1,"alway":1,"dread":1,"anyon":2,"mere":1,"practic":1,"todo":2,"photo":1,"look":1,"wearisom":1,"resource—thi":1,"healthi":1,"push":1,"might":3,"energi":2,"":18,"sit":1,"unrespons":1,"need":1,"joke":1,"thought":2,"cours":1,"quagmir":1,"progress":1,"becom":1,"truism":1,"less":1,"dopaminerg":1,"delet":1,"moss":1,"editor":1,"reli":1,"frustrat":1,"there":2,"realiz":1,"whole":1,"at—lik":1,"search":2,"kind":1,"liabl":1,"pull":1,"reward":1,"creep":1,"low":1,"server":1,"extens":1}},"25603":{"id":"25603","title":"how to find the right words - by Nicole - startingfromnix","link":"https://nicoles.substack.com/p/how-to-find-the-right-words?s=r","content":"how to find the right words by not defaulting to silence\n\nA quality I really admire is precision, granularity. Sometimes I read someone’s writing and I’m like holy shit… it’s so exact. It feels like someone decisively struck the chord they wanted to, a perfect and beautiful note carrying itself clearly through space. How does this person know everything I’m feeling! Why does it feel like this piece was written just for me in this whole wide world?\n\nDetail is what makes everything beautiful. But getting incredibly precise and attuned to detail is an art form. One that is built on the foundations of practice and effort. Getting precise requires intently looking at something and seeing it for what it is rather than what you expect it to be. Then describing it as so. I’m always trying to get closer to that in my writing (I’m not there yet and it sucks). Often there’s something I want to say, but I can’t quite find the right words.\n\nThe default is silence, but that doesn’t really help anyone get better at anything — writing or honest communication. Some of my biggest regrets came from staying silent because I didn’t have the ‘right words’. In hindsight, I always wished I could tell people how I felt instead of cowering behind silence. In writing I wish I could write clearer and more specific sentences. But to get to clarity in either is a slow trudge. To get to where I want to be, I have to keep writing, keep communicating, keep attempting. I can’t be silent. I think of it like playing darts. When you start, most times the dart doesn’t even make it onto the board. You just have to keep throwing darts over and over to get closer (on average) to the center.\n\nThere’s that iconic line from John Berger I saved ages ago: nearly every artist can draw when he has made a discovery. But to draw in order to discover – that is the godlike process. So whether the words are right or not, I keep going and going. I’ve been letting go of silence. Instead, I try to say what I truly mean to the people I love. I write down what captivates me. I trust the slow process of spiraling closer to the inward center. These small, unexpected, emergent discoveries make it all worth it.\n\nSo what if it doesn’t look the way you planned? All of these days still belong to you, and even the greatest disappointments have their uses. Everything is a litany of things, a network of things, each with its own context and purpose. Be careful, when reviewing, not to strip the happenings from their larger meaning. Nothing happens all on its own, and everything has potential for beauty.

It is waiting to be read by the one person it was specifically written for.\n\nThat person is you.\n\nRemember the first time you logged on to the internet?\n\nDepending on how old you are, you might have had to connect your computer to an old 56k dial up modem which made a weird noise of electronic squawks and beeps.\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 audio.\n\nAnd then, once a connection had been established, you suddenly had access to a completely new world. A world of seemingly infinite yet unknown possibilities. A world full of ideas, resources and thoughts from people all around the globe. A world waiting for you to be explored.\n\nEveryone of us has experienced their own transformative moments with computers. The first time you touched a touchscreen. The first time you wrote and executed a line of code. The first time you discovered a video game that completely consumed you.\n\nIt’s often difficult to describe these moments because, like magic, they lie beyond articulation. They have to be experienced.\n\nComputers are not magic in themselves. It’s the software that runs on them, the interaction between bits and atoms, that makes them magical.\n\nOne ingredient of computer magic is software’s ability to create even more magical experiences. It’s a tool for tools. Great software supports human intellect. But magical software enhances human creativity.\n\nThe early pioneers of modern computing described computers as “dream machines”. What got them excited about computers was not so much what they were, but everything they had the potential to be.\n\nThis is the other facet of software magic: It stretches our imagination beyond what we thought was possible. Great software makes us feel like we live in the future. But magical software allows us to imagine the future that comes after it.\n\nWe look back at these magical moments with nostalgia.\n\nWhat happened to them?\n\nWe now live in a world where computers have become ubiquitous. They are everywhere, in all shapes and sizes, available to us whenever we need them. We have dream machines at work, at home, and in each of our pockets.\n\nThe computing capacity of these machines is mind boggling. Even the most audacious cyber-visionaries of the past would not have predicted the power available at our fingertips today.\n\nAs a result, the world we live in today is shaped and dominated by bits rather than just atoms. Software now touches every arena of human society and more and more aspects of our lives depend on it.\n\nIt sounds like the future. But it’s not the future we envisioned.\n\nWhile software is indeed everywhere, truly magical software has become incredibly rare. It was slowly suppressed and pushed away by dark forces.\n\nEnter the villains of this story.\n\nThe idea of augmenting our work with the help of software was well intended. But instead of creativity enhancing superpowers, we got attention-seeking productivity silos. Alerts here, notifications there. We are spending more time with the coordination of our work than with the work we actually want to get done. Our dream machines are more powerful than ever before, but their output is riddled with noise and distractions.\n\nAs competition intensifies, founders rush to get their products out into the market. Product teams literally work in sprints. Craftsmanship was replaced with growth hacks. It’s not just the software itself that lacks personality; has every tech company hired the same illustrator? Our once so lively dreams have become positively lifeless.\n\nA famous quote says that the best way to predict the future is to invent it. Essentially, this is what the magic of software is all about: It lets us paint a vision of the future while simultaneously providing us with the tools to make that future a reality. And yet, ironically, the tools and principles with which we build the future are stuck in the past. The Agile Manifesto was published more than 20 years ago. Its terminology and fundamentals are outdated. But there’s also no definitive methodology that has taken its place.\n\nWhile we were busy dreaming up visionary ideas we failed to see the dark forces that crept in and clouded our plans. We have arrived at our destination, but it’s not the destination we had in mind. Error 404: Utopian future not found.\n\nThe magic of software was lost along the way.\n\nBut not all hope is lost. What if we can bring it back?\n\nIn the not so distant past, a small group of individuals got together and decided to change the status quo. They decided to go on a quest and bring back the magic of software.\n\nThat small group is us. We are the toolmakers in this story.\n\nEvery great story contains a sacred artifact of great importance. A legendary sword. A secret key. A mystical elixir. A powerful tool without which the battle against evil couldn’t be won.\n\nOur mission is to create the tool for the story at hand. A tool that feels magical, but more importantly, a tool that grants whoever owns it the ability to create magic.\n\nThe tool we are building is the fastest of its kind. It is incredibly easy to use, but also grows more powerful with each interaction. And it comes with new and refined methodologies and practices around it to truly unleash its power.\n\nWe chose to name it Linear to signify progress.\n\nTo bring back the magic of software, however, it needs more than just a powerful tool. A powerful tool needs a powerful operator, just like a magical story needs a courageous hero or heroine.\n\nThe real protagonists of this story are the creators. The designers who invent the dream worlds of tomorrow. The engineers who turn dreams into realities. The entrepreneurs who want to create impact. The ambitious teams who craft software experiences that truly feel magical again.\n\nIf technology is an expression of humanity’s dreams, then the future of technology is only bound by the limits of our dreams. We need to bring back the magic of software because it is the only way to push the boundaries of our dreams. Because it is the only way to give our dream machines back their real meaning.\n\nWe are coming to the end of our little tale and you might be wondering where you fit into all of this. After all, wasn’t this story specifically written for you?\n\nIndeed it was, dear reader.\n\nWe have reached the end of this page but only the beginning of our real story. And as fortune may have it, you have been elected to partake in its next chapters.\n\nWho you play in these chapters is for you to decide. You might be an engineer. You might be a designer. You might be a recruiter or a marketer. All that is certain is that you will help us to bring back the magic of software.\n\nThis is your call to adventure. Hurry up and answer it.\n\nWe are waiting for you.","tokenFrequency":{"build":2,"quo":1,"evil":1,"heroin":1,"look":1,"whitepap":1,"hope":1,"rare":1,"call":1,"dial":1,"legendari":1,"intensifi":1,"atom":2,"pocket":1,"html5":1,"told":1,"game":1,"page":1,"good":2,"404":1,"terminolog":1,"transform":1,"silo":1,"get":2,"turn":1,"often":1,"replac":1,"tech":1,"arena":1,"begin":2,"away":1,"essenti":1,"provid":1,"incred":2,"enter":1,"adventur":1,"spend":1,"quot":1,"squawk":1,"dream":10,"machin":4,"alert":1,"complet":2,"fastest":1,"distract":1,"full":1,"reach":1,"distant":1,"discov":1,"size":1,"individu":1,"group":2,"sudden":1,"error":1,"connect":2,"excit":1,"toolmak":1,"experienc":2,"growth":1,"yet":2,"attentionseek":1,"hand":1,"master":1,"nois":2,"paint":1,"come":3,"end":3,"wrote":1,"hurri":1,"sit":1,"societi":1,"hero":1,"bound":1,"go":1,"dark":2,"visionari":1,"cybervisionari":1,"there":1,"crept":1,"depend":2,"augment":1,"mission":1,"compani":1,"intend":1,"fit":1,"suppress":1,"back":7,"fail":1,"refin":1,"result":1,"becom":3,"idea":3,"certain":1,"time":5,"thought":2,"linear":1,"instead":1,"also":2,"quest":1,"definit":1,"own":1,"beep":1,"bring":5,"potenti":1,"kind":1,"it":7,"way":4,"protagonist":1,"allow":1,"fortun":1,"busi":1,"answer":1,"help":2,"peopl":1,"explor":1,"whenev":1,"unleash":1,"modem":1,"read":2,"envis":1,"imagin":2,"inde":2,"creativ":2,"boggl":1,"everyth":1,"courag":1,"softwar":19,"middl":1,"illustr":1,"outdat":1,"competit":1,"actual":1,"globe":1,"vision":1,"chapter":2,"much":1,"aspect":1,"act":1,"progress":1,"happen":1,"littl":1,"impact":1,"product":3,"access":1,"support":2,"seem":1,"rememb":1,"artifact":1,"craft":1,"tale":1,"power":8,"need":5,"consum":1,"world":7,"tomorrow":1,"first":4,"rather":1,"creator":1,"rush":1,"whoever":1,"dear":1,"see":1,"mean":1,"liter":1,"lack":1,"readm":2,"wonder":1,"founder":1,"simultan":1,"market":2,"possibl":2,"realiti":2,"stretch":1,"famous":1,"publish":1,"futur":10,"sword":1,"side":1,"boundari":1,"ingredi":1,"would":1,"done":1,"home":1,"plan":2,"posit":1,"comput":9,"capac":1,"give":1,"use":1,"new":2,"mystic":1,"touch":2,"real":3,"limit":1,"fundament":1,"chose":1,"signifi":1,"20":1,"along":1,"predict":2,"say":1,"coordin":1,"everywher":2,"principl":1,"lost":2,"machines”":1,"elixir":1,"person":3,"lifeless":1,"place":1,"won":1,"interact":2,"easi":1,"slowli":1,"stuck":1,"experi":2,"partak":1,"earli":1,"unknown":1,"everi":3,"three":1,"want":2,"around":2,"weird":1,"mind":2,"hire":1,"key":1,"line":1,"domin":1,"grant":1,"invent":2,"everyon":1,"browser":1,"human":4,"describ":2,"stori":16,"audio":1,"like":6,"even":2,"push":2,"one":3,"grow":1,"manifesto":2,"reader":1,"taken":1,"found":1,"might":5,"abil":2,"shape":2,"team":2,"howev":1,"wasn't":1,"execut":1,"status":1,"truli":3,"oper":1,"“dream":1,"code":1,"utopian":1,"creat":4,"year":1,"small":2,"well":1,"electron":1,"may":1,"notif":1,"articul":1,"fingertip":1,"audaci":1,"design":2,"lie":1,"riddl":1,"recruit":1,"villain":1,"beyond":2,"beverag":1,"ago":1,"feel":3,"magic":21,"ubiquit":1,"best":1,"great":4,"moment":3,"avail":2,"work":5,"difficult":1,"entrepreneur":1,"battl":1,"secret":2,"past":3,"togeth":1,"codex":1,"sprint":1,"bit":2,"craftsmanship":1,"live":5,"engin":2,"decid":3,"iron":1,"56k":1,"technolog":2,"run":1,"enhanc":2,"play":1,"touchscreen":1,"written":2,"us":8,"agil":1,"without":1,"ever":1,"express":1,"name":1,"output":1,"contain":1,"tool":11,"hot":1,"simpl":3,"superpow":1,"sacr":1,"modern":1,"got":3,"today":2,"methodolog":2,"sound":1,"cloud":1,"made":1,"ambiti":1,"hack":1,"practic":1,"import":2,"video":1,"resourc":1,"internet":1,"make":3,"intellect":1,"infinit":1,"old":2,"facet":1,"nostalgia":1,"log":1,"pioneer":1,"elect":1,"establish":1,"forc":2,"couldn't":1,"destin":2,"let":1,"wait":4,"specif":2,"":45,"arriv":1,"next":1,"chang":1,"ideal":1}},"25573":{"id":"25573","title":"Fund ideas, not pedigree, to find fresh insight","link":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02743-2","content":"Thank you for visiting nature.com.

Members of the board and I spoke with more than 400 young scientists and kept hearing the same depressing refrain: many were writing grants not for work they really wanted to do, but for projects they thought could get funded. Often, they were not even bringing their best ideas to the table.\n\nAnd why would they? Grant review tends to be biased against innovation; researchers’ best shot at funding is proposing the same sort of work that they have already proved they can do. Although there is some evidence to suggest that peer review can distinguish solid research from poor research, it is not clear that it can identify the very best — especially as falling funding rates demand that reviewers make finer and finer distinctions when selecting which projects to support.\n\nOne way to improve the situation is for funders to try different schemes and share their experiences. The Villum Fonden is the largest philanthropic foundation in Denmark for the support of technical and natural-science research. Such foundations have more leeway than organizations funded by taxpayers to experiment with different ways of selecting which research to finance.\n\nTwo years ago, when I was director of science at the foundation, we set up a project that we hoped would support innovative ideas by evaluating applications in an unusual way. Assessment of research proposals would be blinded and based on a three-page description. Evaluators would have no information on the applicant’s background or publishing record. By coincidence, I learned that the Volkswagen Foundation in Hanover, Germany, was running a similar scheme; we both hoped to gather evidence on how grant review worked. Each foundation had, independently, dubbed its new scheme ‘Experiment’.\n\nIn January 2017, the Villum Experiment called for “science so risky that applicants would not normally consider putting forward the project for funding”. We committed about 15% of our annual funds to this sort of research. We recruited evaluators whom we thought (by reputation) would be particularly able to judge risky ideas — for example, people we knew to have discussed new ways of funding research. They ranked each application they read. Each reviewer was also given one ‘golden ticket’ — a right to fund an application, no matter what their fellow reviewers said.\n\nFunding rates at both foundations were just over 10% of the applications submitted for this call. Recipients included both postdocs and department heads, and about one-third of successful applicants were under the age of 40. So far, the Villum Foundation has awarded 39 grants of up to two years each, and the Volkswagen scheme 96 of up to 18 months; overall, each grant is worth from about €120,000 (US$148,000) to €250,000. In the Villum model, 31% were funded on the basis of golden tickets. Although all golden-ticket grants scored better than most others in this call, about half would not have been funded if based on cumulative scores from all reviewers. In the Volkswagen scheme, 11% were golden tickets, none of which would have been funded otherwise.\n\nIn a survey, about half of the recipients said that had the call for unorthodox ideas not been anonymous, they would not have proposed their winning idea — they didn’t think they had a shot if judged on their publishing track records. Reviewers said that they liked evaluating ideas without knowing the applicant’s past performance.\n\nThere are wrinkles to iron out. Some reviewers are concerned that if junior researchers’ risky ideas don’t work out, promising scholars will have missed a chance to pursue more-conservative projects. Others warn that recipients might not be qualified to carry out their plans. It is too soon to know, and we want to learn more. The second round of applications closes on 21 March.\n\nMeanwhile, we want to work out how to bring in more ideas. We asked applicants what might have kept colleagues from applying. Answers included discomfort with risky projects; concerns that funding decisions would be haphazard; short-duration and limited funds; the inability to simply reuse another application; and a perception that ideas were either not good or risky enough. The numbers are too small to be certain, but there are signs that men are more likely to get funded. Both foundations plan to tweak how applicants and reviewers are recruited — for example, using ungendered text in the call for proposals — and will continue to monitor diversity.\n\nWhat interests me most about the experiment is the prospect of better understanding peer review to improve the process. The Bill \u0026 Melinda Gates Foundation uses blind review for awards in its Grand Challenges Explorations programme, and New Zealand’s Health Research Council uses a random-number generator to prioritize ‘Explorer’ grant proposals that have fulfilled certain criteria. The global RAND Corporation and an international panel convened by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research have compiled an overview of review approaches and the — limited — empirical evidence for them.\n\nTo paraphrase Winston Churchill, grant peer review might be the worst system, except all the others. Given the massive resources dedicated to it, we need a better evidence base to guide its evolution.\n\nYou have full access to this article via your institution.\n\nAn essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, delivered to your inbox every weekday.\n\nSign up for the Nature Briefing newsletter — what matters in science, free to your inbox daily.\n\nGet the most important science stories of the day, free in your inbox.","tokenFrequency":{"applic":13,"even":1,"abl":1,"know":2,"finer":2,"40":1,"idea":9,"appli":1,"grand":1,"experi":6,"ensur":1,"internet":1,"ask":2,"inbox":3,"award":2,"news":1,"explor":3,"iron":1,"select":2,"new":3,"turn":1,"exampl":2,"meantim":1,"other":3,"villum":4,"massiv":1,"articl":2,"31":1,"date":1,"scholar":2,"junior":1,"grant":9,"overview":1,"18":1,"mode":1,"pubm":1,"technic":1,"professor":1,"enough":1,"rank":1,"generat":1,"track":1,"institut":3,"annual":1,"score":2,"shot":2,"gate":1,"colleagu":1,"independ":1,"access":2,"cumul":1,"tabl":1,"review":15,"prove":1,"group":1,"reus":1,"health":2,"survey":1,"stori":1,"might":4,"onethird":1,"prize":1,"essenti":1,"display":1,"site":1,"ungend":1,"us$148000":1,"vicepresid":1,"consid":1,"pursu":1,"haphazard":1,"publish":2,"two":2,"base":3,"solid":1,"funding”":1,"recruit":2,"tend":1,"distinguish":1,"inform":1,"want":3,"continu":2,"rate":2,"guid":1,"assess":1,"fund":14,"recipi":3,"council":1,"search":1,"interest":1,"bring":2,"men":1,"half":2,"earlycar":1,"priorit":1,"thank":1,"foundat":11,"includ":2,"€120000":1,"hear":1,"improv":2,"decis":1,"import":1,"day":1,"board":1,"free":4,"zealand":1,"full":2,"sinkjær":2,"model":1,"hanov":1,"canadian":1,"goldenticket":1,"young":1,"especi":1,"15":1,"hope":2,"nation":1,"leeway":1,"naturalsci":1,"dub":1,"11":1,"400":1,"recommend":1,"divers":1,"month":1,"work":6,"identifi":1,"right":1,"conven":1,"univers":1,"tri":1,"process":1,"—":9,"ago":2,"commit":1,"churchil":1,"could":1,"10":1,"version":1,"propos":6,"suggest":1,"chanc":1,"randomnumb":1,"learn":2,"criteria":1,"riski":5,"germani":1,"need":1,"number":1,"simpli":1,"evolut":1,"weekday":1,"inabl":1,"bold":1,"good":1,"particular":1,"fall":1,"way":4,"past":1,"“scienc":1,"thoma":2,"differ":2,"although":2,"tweak":1,"director":2,"denmark":1,"moreconserv":1,"second":1,"natur":1,"dedic":1,"like":2,"think":1,"largest":1,"author":1,"member":1,"daili":1,"project":6,"anonym":2,"clear":1,"poor":1,"via":2,"senior":1,"visit":1,"perform":1,"demand":1,"fonden":1,"blind":2,"depress":1,"golden":4,"better":3,"challeng":1,"fellow":1,"discomfort":1,"put":1,"limit":3,"distinct":1,"head":1,"approach":1,"also":2,"percept":1,"get":3,"wrinkl":1,"39":1,"concern":2,"evid":4,"aalborg":1,"paraphras":1,"sort":2,"kept":2,"knew":1,"one":2,"otherwis":1,"carri":1,"fulfil":1,"qualifi":1,"answer":1,"descript":1,"best":4,"corpor":1,"share":1,"said":3,"danish":1,"thought":2,"evalu":4,"certain":2,"worth":1,"matter":2,"system":1,"googl":1,"bias":1,"either":1,"peer":3,"intern":1,"alreadi":1,"taxpay":1,"21":1,"roundup":1,"everi":1,"run":1,"analysi":1,"warn":1,"anoth":1,"forward":1,"bet":1,"brief":1,"naturecom":1,"didn't":1,"volkswagen":3,"soon":1,"javascript":1,"scienc":4,"don't":1,"march":1,"submit":1,"say":1,"postdoc":2,"empir":1,"browser":2,"read":1,"":19,"mani":1,"age":1,"copenhagen":2,"without":2,"global":1,"scheme":5,"overal":1,"organ":1,"given":2,"small":1,"resourc":1,"bill":1,"januari":1,"similar":1,"discuss":1,"record":2,"refrain":1,"meanwhil":1,"compat":1,"year":3,"five":1,"set":1,"winston":1,"rand":1,"normal":1,"96":1,"threepag":1,"would":10,"monitor":1,"compil":1,"shortdur":1,"melinda":1,"ticket":4,"realli":1,"background":1,"deliv":1,"close":1,"write":1,"sign":2,"focus":1,"understand":1,"held":1,"round":1,"style":1,"except":1,"obtain":1,"often":1,"gather":1,"promis":1,"unorthodox":1,"reput":1,"coincid":1,"unusu":1,"judg":2,"2017":1,"support":5,"funder":2,"€250000":1,"success":1,"prospect":1,"peopl":1,"depart":1,"innov":2,"use":5,"scientist":2,"win":1,"programm":1,"basi":1,"research":13,"miss":1,"text":1,"lundbeck":1,"philanthrop":1,"financ":1,"situat":1,"newslett":1,"opinion":1,"make":2,"spoke":1,"worst":1,"none":1,"plan":2,"far":1,"css":1,"panel":1,"call":5}},"20282":{"id":"20282","title":"⚡ The Creator's Dilemma - Reboot","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/cbpp?s=r","content":"In our last essay, Bianca Aguilar argued : “Creatives shouldn’t be perpetuating existing systems; instead, they should be reimagining reality.” In today’s essay (our first longread!), Reboot fellow and Brown CS student Lucas Gelfond does precisely that.\n\nIn approximately 10 weeks, I’ll gain access to a Los Angeles Public Library ebook copy of Haruki Murakami’s “Kafka on the Shore.” As I recently learned, the system for digital books is directly modeled after library paperbacks; I am #101 on a waitlist for 20 copies. This is not without reason — publishers and authors need to make money on book sales — but it fundamentally ignores the logic of digital media. Digital media’s promise lies in the infinite reproducibility of files with virtually no distribution cost; while lending a physical book would mean losing your access, sending a file literally creates more copies.\n\nThis presents a problem for business — infinite supply would make ebooks worthless on an open market. Digital rights management, locking files so they can be opened by a limited set of owners, came about to solve this.\n\nEbook waitlists are one of many adverse consequences of this artificial scarcity. Users who can’t pay for subscription journalism only have access to low quality news: in other words, “ the truth is paywalled, but the lies are free .” Many academic journals are too expensive for academics in the Global South to access, the sum of which contain “the world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage” in the words of legendary technologist and activist Aaron Swartz’s “ Guerilla Open Access Manifesto .”\n\nThe economic systems we’ve devised to pay creators are walling off information from the public; for creators who are motivated by the promise of making things that reach millions, this is a difficult choice.\n\nMuch of the recent discussion about artist payment models comes from an often uncritical tech press and financially entwined venture capitalists who fail to ask larger questions about access and whether the ‘disruptions’ to our media environment are desirable. When we discuss the creator economy we need to consider questions beyond compensation — who gets access to content, how content is produced, what type of content is incentivized — in order to take full advantage of the abundance digital media promises us.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to apply such an evaluative framework to four popular models for creation: paid subscriptions, government funding, non-fungible tokens, and commons-based peer production.\n\nSubstack is best known for promoting a paid subscription model for writing. Subscriptions offer obvious benefits for creators; for those with devoted fans, it promises editorial independence and financial security in regular payouts. This said, writers deliver content to a smaller group of paying users (the “ 1,000 True Fans ” model) versus a larger, nonpaying, and likely more diverse audience one would expect with ad-supported media.\n\nThe model also incentivizes different types of content than traditional media. Individual writers compete for paying readers, so many differentiate themselves on the basis of personality and voice. As such, while the platform has some successful investigative journalism and general reporting, much of it tends toward personal narrative and commentary.\n\nSubstack’s use of writer advances may have limits as well. While they provide some creators with a financial cushion to go independent, it leaves out those who do not already have an audience, and in doing so may prevent new writers from less traditional backgrounds from starting careers in writing.\n\nOne interesting alternative is a platform-funded Universal Creator Income (UCI) , as spelled out by Li Jin and Lila Shroff . Unlike programs like Substack Pro or TikTok Creator Fund , a UCI could provide funding regardless of skill or background, focusing on emerging creators who might not have had an ability to create full time. While a UCI is an exciting concept, its uniqueness is in its universality, and it's unclear whether venture-backed companies would be willing to provide such a large quantity and range of creators with meaningful, continuous funding.\n\nSome Substack writers embrace a third form of creator payment. Donations , which power newsletters like Feminist Giant and ChinAI , generate money for writers while keeping all their content free. The existence of such newsletters indicates some creators value the accessibility of their content over maximizing profits, and points to the need for alternative creation models.\n\nAnother class of creator funding models would be implemented by the government, like a modern version of the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project , an effort of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal. The Federal Art Project was unique in that it employed nearly 10,000 artists across the country, regardless of skill. Today’s policymakers could propose a modern incarnation of the Federal Art Project — rather than just murals, what about books, articles, or even software projects?\n\nA more commonly discussed proposal is something like Andrew Yang’s “Freedom Dividend” or other forms of universal basic income , a welfare program designed to provide all citizens with regular, unrestricted cash transfers to cover basic needs. Both WPA-style programs and a UBI would free creators from needing to compete in a market to sell their work. As such, these solutions could support a far broader range of creative works. However, each would also face immense political barriers and may be less feasible than non-governmental solutions.\n\nA third option is public funding for media companies like NPR and PBS. Publicly-funded media could operate without monetizing the content itself, enabling them to release their works to the public under a Creative Commons license. However, centralized media is likely to represent a narrower set of perspectives, perhaps those most amenable to government interests.\n\nNFTs are tokens that represent ownership of a specific asset, such as a song or art piece, without necessarily restricting access to it. The model has made recent headlines for extraordinary sale prices — Beeple’s “ Everydays: The First 5000 Days ” sold for the equivalent of more than $69 million USD in Ethereum. In the past, artists could find themselves in destitution even if their artwork began to appreciate in value; if it was already sold to others, the increases in value would not accrue to them. In contrast, artists make money whenever NFTs are sold, collecting a percentage of the sale price.\n\nOne implementation of the model is Mirror , a blogging platform that differentiates itself by minting each post as an NFT. Readers can crowdfund essays with ETH in return for a proportional cut of the NFT sales, and because the NFT only represents ownership, such works remain accessible to the public.\n\nHowever, NFT sales are likely to mimic power law dynamics and favor already established artists. In addition, NFTs still relegate creation to market forces, promoting the production of sensational, provocative content. The model is unlikely to support ‘boring’ creation like news reporting and creative maintenance — information that is necessary but seen as less ‘artistic,’ and thus less likely to fetch large sums on an exchange.\n\nSubscription models, NFTs, government-sponsored creation and UCIs are all promising new ways of funding creative work. But each of these models leaves pieces out of the picture: What about content that requires the work of collectives, not single individuals? What about creation that is fully freed from the perverse incentives of government or market?\n\nThe P2P Foundation cites David Bollier’s definition of a commons as “a shared resource which is co-governed by its user community, according to the rules and norms of that community.”\n\nThe commons, however, also refers to an alternate production process and a series of social processes and relationships that facilitate a commons “ecosystem.” The commons-based peer production (CBPP) process revolves around three institutions: a productive community, a commons-oriented market entity, and a for-benefit organization. The most prominent example of the commons and CBPP process is Wikipedia, a case study which offers a masterclass in collective production.\n\nWikipedia’s productive community includes both paid and volunteer contributors and editors to pages on the site. The site’s process is a cycle of open input, a participatory editing process. Users feel compelled to contribute because they have a reciprocal relationship with the site; they reap the benefits of the same Wikipedia they helped to improve.\n\nAn entrepreneurial coalition , whether a company or a worker cooperative, provides employment to commons contributors and creates value to be reinvested in the community. It’s important that the commons itself always lies outside of the market; entrepreneurial coalitions create value elsewhere. For example, Wikipedia’s entrepreneurial coalition is the Wikia company, which produces fan-based wikis and sells ads on them.\n\nThe third pillar of a CBPP ecosystem is a “for-benefit” organization , which oversees governance of a commons. It does not force volunteers to contribute or even direct their contributions; rather, the organization manages conflicts, fundraises, and aids the general capacity for common production. In Wikipedia’s example, this is the Wikimedia Foundation.\n\nCBPP fundamentally differs from other models in that it is built on collaboration versus individual creation. A site like Wikipedia — factual, balanced, global — could not exist in any other model because it necessitates regular editing and improvement. CBPP even recognizes that some resources are ‘anti-rivalrous’ — the more people who use them, the stronger they become.\n\nIn addition, because entrepreneurial coalitions do not directly profit from the commons resource, the production and development of the commons is not beholden to profit incentives; in contrast to subscription and NFT models, CBPP separates profit from production. The most edited Wikipedia articles are not necessarily the most scandalous or provocative, but rather the topics that the productive community is most interested in. That is, there is no clickbait on Wikipedia.\n\nTo facilitate open access, fair attribution, and continuous collaboration, CBPP systems are best served by licensing under a CopyFair or copyleft license. Copyleft licenses, like Creative Commons often allow others to remix, redistribute, and even use works commercially if attribution to the original author is preserved. Copyleft creators can make money through merchandising and other models associated with the original work. Meanwhile, CopyFair licenses require commercial users to contribute some of the profits back to the original project.\n\nCBPP is more than just a utopian ideal. In addition to Wikipedia, versions of this arrangement have produced a wide variety of essential technologies, like Mozilla Firefox , RepRap , Linux , the Free Software Foundation’s GNU , and WordPress .\n\nAdditionally, while CBPP has existed on its own, policies like basic income which free up time for commons-producing activities may enable contributions from a wider and more diverse group.\n\nCommons-based peer production is not a perfect fit for all types of creative production. It is necessarily collective, parts must be modularized, and its setup may take additional work. If correctly implemented, however, CBPP embraces the social aspects of creation and is built around openness and access.\n\nDiscussion of creator payment models frequently centers on payment, assuming people are motivated solely by financial incentives. Creators value more than just money; they care about the type of content they’ll produce and how many people it will reach, sometimes more than pure financial gain. Financialized models of creator payment like NFTs and subscription models provide an important service for creators, but restrict the type of content that can be produced.\n\nAs such, we should broaden our search to solutions that lie outside of these narrow boundaries, like a universal basic income, CBPP systems, and other infrastructure for creating outside of a market. When we don’t, we fail to recognize the importance of creative control and the joy of reaching a global audience with one’s work. When we talk about “creator monetization,” we shouldn’t lose sight of why we’re here.\n\nLucas Gelfond is a 2021 Reboot Fellow and a Computer Science student at Brown University.

The whole ecosystem was centered around CBPP, although I didn’t know it at the time. I just knew to license all of my stuff under Creative Commons licenses and that the movement owed everything to RepRap. When I got more interested in tech activism and Aaron Swartz’s work, I started to think more about IP and open access, and I learned about the term and mechanics of CBPP for the first time in Future Economies Reading Group.\n\nTell me about your experience in the Reboot Fellowship!\n\nMy conversations about politics/social justice and tech as an industry had been fairly separate before Reboot; my favorite part of the fellowship was befriending people who care about both in the same way. I was repeatedly blown away by the quality of the group and am particularly excited by the prospect of working with other fellows in the future to tackle some of these problems.\n\nWhat's one book you loved this year?\n\nHonestly, just check out all the links in Lucas’s essay.

One afternoon this July, people sat at outdoor tables beneath drooping strings of fairy lights, sipping cocktails and spearing colorful, modestly dressed salads. The line for Salt \u0026 Straw, a venture-funded, “chef-driven” ice-cream shop, stretched up the block, and athleisure-clad twentysomethings photographed themselves eating waffle cones, fabric masks pulled down around their chins like turkey wattles. A month earlier, Abbot Kinney had become a central gathering place for protesters during the mass demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism. Moxie Marlinspike, who firmly supported the protests, noticed that many of the high-end businesses, fearing looters, had boarded up their windows, then decorated the plywood with murals and messages in support of Black Lives Matter . “It kind of reminded me of how, right after the Russian Revolution, a lot of the zeks—the sort of criminal underclass—would get full-chest tattoos of Marx and Lenin and, later, Stalin because they thought the Bolsheviks would be less likely to kill them,” he joked, as we wandered along the Venice Beach boardwalk.\n\nMarlinspike is the C.E.O. of Signal, the end-to-end encrypted messaging service, which he launched in 2014; he is also a cryptographer, a hacker, a shipwright, and a licensed mariner. Tall and sinewy, with the build of a natural athlete who abstains from team sports, he was wearing black jeans, a black T-shirt, black Teva sandals, a denim jacket, and a white N95 mask. He has blond dreadlocks, which he had tucked under a blue cap. An avid surfer, he had been living in the neighborhood with friends for about two years, but, aside from the ocean, it held little appeal for him. “Living in Venice is like living at the end of the world, the end of history,” he told me, dryly. “All the decisions have been made. This is the world we get.”\n\nSignal’s growth has corresponded to periods in which decisions are questioned or undone—to moments of social and political upheaval. With end-to-end encryption, the content of every communication—a text message, a video chat, a voice call, an emoji reaction—is intelligible only to the sender and the recipient. If an exchange is intercepted, by a hacker or a government agency, the interloper sees a nonsensical snarl of letters and numbers. Signal does not share growth metrics, but in late 2016 Marlinspike told the Times that the number of daily Signal downloads had grown by four hundred per cent since the election of Donald Trump . This summer in the U.S., the service was flooded with an estimated several million new users. In early July, after China imposed a sweeping national-security law, Signal was briefly the most downloaded app in Hong Kong. The Electronic Frontier Foundation includes Signal in its “Surveillance Self-Defense” guide; Edward Snowden , a friend of Marlinspike, has endorsed it for years.\n\nAll this has given Signal a halo of subversion, but Marlinspike believes that encrypted-communication tools are necessary not just in times of political tumult. Most people who use social networks and chat services, he argues, assume that their digital communications are private; they want to share their thoughts and photographs with their friends—not with Facebook and Google, not with advertisers, and certainly not on the dark Web. “In a sense, I feel like Signal is just trying to bring normality to the Internet,” he said as we sat on a patch of grass near the beach. “A lot of what we’re trying to do is just square the actual technology with people’s intent.” He plucked two small feathers out of the grass, rolled them between his fingers, and planted them upright in the dirt.\n\nSince Signal was released, it has evolved from a niche tool, touted by the privacy-minded and the paranoid, into a mainstream product recommended by the Wall Street Journal. Activists use Signal to coördinate protests, lovers to conduct affairs, workers to unionize, finance professionals to exchange sensitive information, drug dealers to contact customers, journalists to communicate with sources. The app has appeared, shimmering with significance, on the TV shows “Mr. Robot,” “House of Cards,” and “Euphoria.” Signal is also reportedly used by the Democratic National Committee, the United States Senate, the European Commission, law-enforcement agencies, Rudy Giuliani, and Melania Trump. “Signal is a piece of public infrastructure, critical infrastructure,” Snowden, who met Marlinspike in 2015, in Moscow, told me over the encrypted video-chat service Jitsi.\n\nMarlinspike is punctual, affable, and unassuming; even his gait is mild. Sometimes while he speaks he gently snaps his fingers, like a metronome. He talked about the “diabolical” ways that the Internet has eroded the barrier between our personal and professional identities. “People who aren’t even professional writers have to consider that their communication is being consumed,” he told me. “Anything that I’ve ever written or created, one way or another, about anything is sort of embarrassing to me a month later. Even more so five years later.”\n\nWhen we first spoke, Marlinspike stressed that he didn’t want to discuss his personal life, a stipulation to which I agreed. Later, after a series of mutually fraught conversations, it became clear that we did not have a common definition of personal information. For him, it included basic biographical facts: age, home town, birth name. (Moxie was a childhood nickname; he declined to elaborate on his surname’s origins.) During several days of conversations in Venice, he was chatty, pleasant, and guarded, avoiding specificities and controversial comments. In the coming weeks, we continued talking, always on the phone, via Signal, and mostly off the record. The telephone is an inherently intimate medium, and the reassurance of an encrypted connection made it feel more so. Still, Marlinspike remained a little opaque to me. I felt that I understood him better through his blog and his social-media runoff—exactly the material he wanted to keep separate from his professional life.\n\nBrit Marling, the actor and writer, who has been a friend of Marlinspike’s for more than a decade, described his “daring and dazzling” discussions with friends. “There’s nothing that you can say to him that’s going to hit a wall,” she said. But she related to his desire for privacy: “As people start to tell you who you are, you start to be boxed in by that impression. I think that’s something Moxie has actively resisted, with a lot of energy.” Snowden described Marlinspike as “phenomenally interesting,” “remarkable,” “wickedly funny,” and a “wild, almost literary figure,” but, not wanting to discourage others from following Marlinspike’s example in challenging the status quo, advised against mythologizing him: “He is an exceptional individual. But, also, what is the seed of him that is ordinary?”\n\nMarlinspike will share that he was born in the early eighties, in Georgia. He spent much of his youth immersed in anarchist literature and communities, and anarchism’s inherent critique of authority is still important to him. This orientation is unusual in the tech world, although its right-wing analogue, libertarianism, is pervasive. “Liberalism basically says that we should all be free to talk about the world we want, and then we have a marketplace of ideas that we can select from,” he said. “I think anarchism’s comment on that is it’s not enough just to talk about things—that you can’t actually know unless you experience or experiment with something.”\n\nSignal, as a nonprofit, is an outlier in the tech industry. It runs entirely on donations. “Signal’s mission has always been to make end-to-end encryption as ubiquitous as possible, rather than a commercial success,” Marlinspike said. Its code base is open-source—publicly available for anyone to download and comment on—and subject to peer review. Most tech companies readily coöperate, and make contracts, with governments, but Signal was founded on the premise that mass surveillance, particularly by governments and corporations, should be impossible. Signal itself cannot read the messages that its users send, and does not collect user metadata. It keeps no call logs or data backups. Signal claims that it has no “backdoors”—built-in circumvention methods designed to give law enforcement or corporations access to encrypted content. In 2016, Signal received a subpoena as part of a federal grand-jury investigation, accompanied by a gag order. A similar request to Google or Facebook likely would have yielded subscriber records with information such as names, credit-card numbers, I.P. addresses, and activity logs. A search warrant would produce e-mails and chat transcripts. Signal could only proffer the relevant phone number’s account-creation date and the date when it had last connected to Signal’s servers. This was a point of pride: Marlinspike posted responses to the gag order and subpoena on Signal’s blog. “Electronic service providers—who have dual roles as custodians of Americans’ private data and as necessary actors in the execution of government surveillance requests—have a critical role to play, and perspective to share publicly, about government surveillance practices,” the author of the responses, an A.C.L.U. lawyer, wrote.\n\nAdvocates of end-to-end encryption argue that any backdoor into an otherwise secure system will immediately become a target for foreign adversaries, terrorists, and hackers. But critics claim that end-to-end encryption could shield terrorist plots, child sexual exploitation, and other criminal activities. Some people note that strong encryption could preclude content moderation, potentially allowing disinformation, hate speech, propaganda, harassment, and incitements of violence to flourish. Governments have pushed hard for backdoor access to encrypted systems; China, Iran, and Russia have banned various messaging apps and services that provide end-to-end encryption. In 2016, Britain passed the Investigatory Powers Act, which authorizes the government to compel communications providers to remove “electronic protection” from any communications and data; in 2018, Australia passed controversial data-encryption laws that allow law-enforcement agencies to demand that private companies include backdoors in their products. Earlier this year, Attorney General William Barr praised a new bill in Congress, the Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act, that, among other things, would require communications providers, hardware manufacturers, tech companies, and others to decrypt data upon provision of a warrant. (Marlinspike told me, “Every time Bill Barr talks about cryptography, I’m, like, Damn, I really wish I could read his Signal messages.”)\n\nEnforcing laws, Marlinspike believes, should be difficult. He likes to say that “we should all have something to hide,” a statement that he intends not as a blanket endorsement of criminal activity but as an acknowledgment that the legal system can be manipulated, and that even the most banal activities or text messages can be incriminating. In his view, frequent lawbreaking points to systemic rot. He often cites the legalization of same-sex marriage and, in some states, marijuana as evidence that people sometimes need to challenge laws or engage in nominally criminal activity for years before progress can be made. “Before, it was inconceivable,” he said. “After, it was inconceivable that it was ever inconceivable.” Privacy, he says, is a necessary condition for experimentation, and for social change. He compares the need for a secure digital space to the need for a private domestic one—where, for instance, a child might safely experiment with gender identity or expression. “If I’m dissatisfied with this world—and I think that I might be—a problem is that you can only desire based on what you know,” Marlinspike said. “You have certain experiences in this world, they produce certain desires, those desires reproduce the world. Our reality today just keeps reproducing itself. If you can create different experiences that manifest different desires, then it’s possible that those will lead to the production of different worlds.”\n\nIn the U.S., for most of the twentieth century, encryption was considered a tool of national security. Most cryptography research was done by the National Security Agency; elsewhere, the topic was considered taboo. Academic papers on encryption were classified. Cryptographic devices were categorized as munitions, and subject to export controls. The government’s caution had to do with the fragility of cryptosystems at the time: to decode encrypted messages, correspondents had to agree in advance on a shared private key, a piece of information that radiated liability. Then, in 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, researchers at Stanford, published a paper that introduced what would come to be called the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In this system, a software program generates for every correspondent two cryptographic “keys”—one public, one private—that are mathematically linked. The public key is used to encrypt messages sent by others; the private key, which is kept secret, is used to decrypt them. In such a system, there is no prearranged code, no third-party item of information. The invention, which Stanford patented, effectively ended the N.S.A.’s stranglehold on encryption technology.\n\nIn the early nineties, with the advent of the commercial Internet, businesses argued that encryption—often referred to as “crypto,” before the moniker was co-opted by digital-currency enthusiasts—was necessary for secure transactions. In what became known as the Crypto Wars, the U.S. government, worried that encryption would make the Internet impossible to control, attempted to crack down on encryption software, in part by invoking the munitions-export law. The cypherpunks, a loose group of engineers and activists who saw encryption as fundamental to a free society, responded by distributing encryption software online and via floppy disk. The resistance had a prankster spirit. To get around the export controls, cypherpunks printed encryption source code on T-shirts and in books.\n\nIn 1993, when telecom systems were widely computerized, the N.S.A. proposed a “key escrow” system: a piece of silicon called a Clipper Chip would be implanted in all new telephones and electronic-communication devices. Such hardware would allow standard encryption while giving the government a backdoor that it could use to intercept otherwise private conversations. The Clipper Chip was abandoned within three years, after a security researcher uncovered a flaw that effectively allowed would-be attackers to bypass the entire system. In any case, the export controls by that point had relaxed, and, by the late nineties, encryption software was circulating in abundance.\n\nAs a child, Marlinspike was only ambiently aware of the Crypto Wars. He took a liking to computers in middle school, and spent hours in the library and local bookstore reading about them. The principles of cryptography “have a childhood appeal,” he told me, noting how children “write in invisible ink with lemon juice, they speak in pig Latin, they come up with their own codes, they do Caesar ciphers, stuff like that.” He began learning about more advanced cryptography, like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and found it unintuitive and surprising—magical. “Without prearranging anything, two people can start talking to each other in a way that nobody can understand, even if they hear the entire conversation,” he said. “You wouldn’t think that would be true. You can just start with nothing.”\n\nAs the commercial Web developed, Marlinspike found like-minded people on Internet Relay Chat (I.R.C.), a messaging service that was popular among early Internet users, including hackers. Hacking was a way to access useful information: copyrighted software manuals, intel on how to make long-distance phone calls for free. In his view, the insecurity of the nascent commercial Web was a threat to corporations, not to people. Relatively few companies collected the kind of sensitive user data—Social Security numbers, credit-card details, banking information—that is now regularly stolen, and sold, in data breaches. “The stakes were just so low,” he told me. “The economy was not connected to the Internet, for the most part.”\n\nMarlinspike described himself as the type of teen-ager who was always searching for “secret doors”: chutes and ladders to escape the drudgery of routine. He did not like school, and took software-engineering jobs at local technology companies, heading to work after classes let out. In 1995, he saw the movie “Hackers,” a thriller about teen-agers in New York City who are framed for cybercrimes by a computer-security professional. The film is full of neon animations, nineties tech references (“RISC architecture is gonna change everything”), and packs of leather-clad teens with nontraditional haircuts huddled around bulky laptops. It is also a Gen X sellout narrative: the villain is an erstwhile hacker seduced to the dark side by corporate America. Sitting in the theatre, Marlinspike felt a new excitement about the future. (He has since seen the movie more than two dozen times.) Soon after, he travelled to New York to meet friends from I.R.C. They got around the city on Rollerblades and went to an arcade, where his friends hacked the payment system. The M.T.A. had recently introduced the MetroCard, part of a complex new computer network; his friends hacked that, too. “It was just like ‘Hackers,’ ” Marlinspike recalled.\n\nIn the late nineties, after graduating from high school, he moved to San Francisco. He spent his first few nights in Alamo Square Park, sleeping across from the Painted Ladies—the row of pastel Victorians associated with the cozy domesticity of “Full House”—with his backpack and computer beside him. Within a few days, he found a couch to sleep on; within a few weeks, he found a job at the software company WebLogic—“a normal dot-com thing of that era.” The company had free beer on Fridays, which made him feel like he was getting away with something. Still, he found it difficult to make friends with his colleagues. “I was just trying to pass, because I was way younger than everyone else,” he said. He was eighteen.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the underground hacker subculture that Marlinspike had admired was morphing into the security industry. As more companies moved online, they built cybersecurity departments, to defend against “black hat” (malicious) hackers. Software engineers began marketing themselves as “white hat” (ethical) hackers, charging high consulting rates. “In retrospect, the only color hat was green,” Marlinspike said. “On either side of that thing, it had all somehow become about money.” Marlinspike disliked the Silicon Valley security culture, which he found exclusive and self-congratulatory, and instead found community in the Bay Area punk scene.\n\nAt the height of the dot-com bubble, he left his software job and spent a while hitchhiking and freight hopping around the country. He lived cheaply, occasionally dumpster diving and squatting on rooftops, charging his electric toothbrush in coffee shops. He built a Web site, the Distributed Library Project, where people could catalogue their home libraries and swap books with other readers. (The site, which was never meant to be a commercial enterprise, attracted a few hundred users but never quite took off: people liked creating and updating their own reading lists but were less inclined to meet up in person.) He helped establish Station 40, an anti-capitalist housing collective and event space in San Francisco’s Mission District, and volunteered with Food Not Bombs, a nebulous international network of activist groups that prepare and serve free vegan food, in protest of consumerism, poverty, and war.\n\nWhen I asked about his experience with anarchist groups at the time, he responded warily. “It’s a fraught thing, in the sense that people think about anarchism, anarchy, anarchists in a lot of different ways,” he said. “If anarchy is a tension away from authority, and toward collective decision-making, individual responsibility, creating a world that we want, that we control ourselves—that is a lot of work. I feel it’s a project of improving the world, and also of self-improvement. But it can look really messy.” Mostly, he found himself in a lot of meetings, discussing the finer points of governance.\n\nIn the early two-thousands, he taught himself to sail by taking a solo two-month round trip to Mexico on a twenty-seven-foot Catalina with a broken engine. Later, he and three friends bought a fibreglass boat on Craigslist for a thousand dollars, restored it, and sailed through the Florida Keys to Grand Bahama Island. That trip, and another the following year, to the Dominican Republic, cost them less than five hundred dollars each. “Hold Fast,” a “video zine” made by Marlinspike about their travels, gives the impression that they are graced with the sort of freedom and youth that stops time. In the film, Marlinspike introduces his crewmates. “If Lisa’s single greatest fear is collision at sea, Allie’s is running aground,” he says in a voice-over. “And then, of course, there’s me. My greatest fear is routine.”\n\nMarlinspike’s outsized adventures were balanced with meticulous, solitary programming projects. He primarily did independent security research—a polite term for ethical hacking. In 2002, he discovered a major vulnerability in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer, and published on his personal Web site, thoughtcrime.org, a software program that replicated the attack. Web-site operators could use the program to find weaknesses in their own sites and services; savvy Internet users could test the security of the sites they visited. Marlinspike received attention from the hacker and security communities for his work, but was disinclined to capitalize on it. Eventually, he added a donation button, like a tip jar, to his Web site. A close friend of his told me, “I think Moxie is someone who’s luckily not motivated by making money.”\n\nIn his mid-twenties, Marlinspike wrote and self-published a handful of zines reflecting on his travels and his time in the Bay Area. I found two of them for sale on the Web site of Red Emma’s, a radical bookstore in Baltimore. They had the dense feel of a Kinko’s production, and the distinct quality of objects that did not belong to me. They seemed clearly intended for a subculture: friends, pen pals, the sort of people who browse radical bookstores in Baltimore. (Inside the package was a handwritten note from the bookseller: “Nice find ☺.”) Marlinspike’s writing is earnest, funny, and occasionally swaggering. The zines do not mention his interest in computers.\n\nBy the end of the two-thousands, Marlinspike was living in Pittsburgh, in a derelict, eight-bedroom, three-story mansion that he shared with a few people. He occasionally ducked into a cryptography class at Carnegie Mellon, and with some friends formed a kind of haphazard research lab called the Institute for Disruptive Studies, which its members sometimes described as a “radical think tank.” “Most of the work we do is in the area of privacy, anonymity, and computer security,” the group’s Web site read, “but has also taken the shape of organic gardening techniques, community bicycle repair projects, and musical experiments.” Marlinspike had a reputation in hacker communities, but in Pittsburgh he was better known for making fireworks and growing heirloom tomatoes, for his knot-tying skills, and for events that he threw with his friends. A popular one was Hat Band, for which people formed bands by picking names out of a hat, and then performed at house shows several weeks later. Marlinspike’s close friend recalled, “You could have known someone for years before that, and you never thought of them as a musician, or a songwriter, or a poet. It not only changes your perception but it changes who they are, and their perception of themselves.” He said, of Marlinspike, “I think some of the things that have always been important to him are trying to find and construct these situations where you can build community and connections with people and have these transformative experiences.”\n\nJackie Wang, an assistant professor of culture and media at the New School, who described her relationship with Marlinspike as sibling-like, met him through an anarchist community on LiveJournal in the early two-thousands, and encountered him in person for the first time at a dance party in Pittsburgh. To try to persuade friends to move to the city, she recalled, Marlinspike and a roommate had designed an “incentive package,” which included a place to stay, a blind date, and a bicycle. “They were really into hospitality,” Wang said, adding that, when she stayed at the mansion, a mint had been left on the pillow.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Marlinspike uncovered an Internet vulnerability that affected nearly every popular browser. It enabled malicious actors to mount what is called a “man-in-the-middle attack”—a type of exploit in which the attacker can view and potentially alter communications between two parties and siphon data, such as log-in credentials, without detection. In 2009, Marlinspike presented the vulnerability at Black Hat D.C., an annual security conference in Washington. He took the opportunity to politely criticize the keynote speaker, Paul Kurtz, a homeland-security expert who had served under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush , and who had spoken about the need for the U.S. to take “leadership in cyberspace,” arguing for collaboration among the N.S.A., law enforcement, and private industry. “You know,” Marlinspike said during his presentation, “ten years ago, I feel like we would have been talking about protecting our communications from the state and the cops—not centralizing them in the hands of the state and the cops.” He paused. “So I think a lot has changed.” At the end of his talk, he released a new tool, SSLstrip, that automatically mounted man-in-the-middle attacks using the vulnerability he had discovered. SSLstrip elevated Marlinspike to expert status. These days, according to Dan Boneh, a cryptographer and a professor at Stanford, the practice of exposing vulnerabilities so that they can be fixed by other engineers, as SSLstrip has done, is “the bread and butter of computer security.” Boneh, who teaches SSLstrip to his undergraduate students, told me, “It changed how browsers work. His attack caused the Web to change.”\n\nMarlinspike had long harbored concerns that the products and business models of private technology corporations—telecom firms, e-mail providers, search engines, social networks—would be built atop rapacious data-collection networks. It was becoming increasingly clear that the state could augment its sprawling surveillance apparatus with the help of private industry. In late 2009, Eric Schmidt , then the C.E.O. of Google, articulated a common stance on user privacy: “If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place,” Schmidt said on CNBC, noting that, under the Patriot Act, which was passed in 2001 to deter and punish terrorism, and to expand the resources available to law enforcement, Internet-service providers could be compelled to share user activity with the authorities. To Marlinspike, this attitude was emblematic of what he saw as a growing threat to everyday Internet users. In response to Schmidt’s comment, and to Google’s business model, Marlinspike began working on a browser extension, GoogleSharing, for Firefox. Google’s business model relies on tying users’ disparate metadata to their activity, which is often achieved by having users log in to their accounts before accessing services. GoogleSharing pooled users’ activity on Google services and anonymized personal information, scrambling individual activity and assigning it to generic proxy identities. This prevented Google from building user profiles, and from collecting information from services that did not require a log-in. Marlinspike no longer maintains the software, but it is still available to download, for free, on GitHub, and has a successor, DuckDuckGo, a search engine that strips queries of identifying data.\n\nIn 2010, Marlinspike and Stuart Anderson, a friend and a robotics Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon, left Pittsburgh and moved to the Bay Area. They formed a small mobile-security startup, Whisper Systems, and worked on a suite of tools, including RedPhone and TextSecure, two Android apps for encrypted communication. In 2011, at the height of the Arab Spring uprisings, they hurriedly designed international editions of RedPhone and TextSecure, specifically for use by Egyptian protesters.\n\nAfter less than a year, Marlinspike and Anderson, Whisper Systems’ only employees, sold the startup to Twitter , for an undisclosed sum. (In 2016, Marlinspike told Wired that it was the most money he had ever seen—“but that’s a low bar.”) At the time, Tyler Reinhard, a longtime friend of Marlinspike’s, and the original designer of RedPhone (and, later, Signal), considered the apps to be more of a proof of concept than a business. RedPhone and TextSecure, he said, were “the antithesis to the dominant view that encryption would never be user-friendly. If the goal was to make the point, the point was well made.” Twitter, then five years old, had become a popular target for hackers; after two security breaches, the Federal Trade Commission had investigated its user-information practices. Reinhard saw the acquisition as a sign that Twitter wanted to take user privacy seriously.\n\nAfter the acquisition announcement, Twitter temporarily shut down RedPhone. Activists and human-rights advocates worried that revoking the service would put the app’s users in danger, by shutting off a secure-communication channel. (Three weeks later, Twitter announced that it would release the code for RedPhone and TextSecure as open-source projects hosted on GitHub, enabling others to maintain the services.) Marlinspike became Twitter’s head of product security, and prepared to encrypt a large-scale system. A colleague of his from the time recalled that he was quiet, and had a pronounced sense of the company’s responsibility to the user: “It was a vibe of ‘They’re giving us their time and their ideas, and we owe them, in return, the honor and respect of being able to use the product safely and securely.’ ” Marlinspike is reticent about his stint at the company, but Nick Bilton, the author of a book about Twitter’s chaotic early years, told me that the boardroom dynamics were constantly compared to “ Game of Thrones .” “There was so much backstabbing,” Bilton said. “There was no one driving the ship. It was sheer dysfunction.” Privacy and safety took a back seat to growth. Direct messages on Twitter are still not end-to-end encrypted.\n\nMarlinspike and a friend owned a Hobie Cat 15, a light fibreglass catamaran. One day in March, 2012, four months into Marlinspike’s job at Twitter, they decided to anchor it in San Francisco Bay, to avoid paying dockage fees. Marlinspike took the catamaran out, and his friend followed in a rowboat. It was dusk, and the conditions were rough; both boats were blown into the bay. As they began to change course, a gust of wind capsized the catamaran, turning it upside down. Marlinspike, who later wrote about the incident in a blog post, tried swimming to shore, but his body began to shut down; the temperature of the bay in early spring averages fifty-four degrees. He returned to the boat, clung to the hull, and tied a line around his wrist, to make his body easier to find. As his vision began to tunnel and his limbs lost sensation, a tugboat passed. The crew pulled Marlinspike out of the water and tried to warm him in the engine room. At the hospital, he went in and out of consciousness; his temperature was too low to register on the digital thermometers, which tend to have a floor of just under ninety degrees. “There’s a tension between how the world works and the feelings after a near-death experience,” Marlinspike said, as we sat on the beach in our masks. “You’re sort of questioning, ‘What are we all doing here?’ You can’t feel that forever, because you’re constantly confronted with a different reality.”\n\nIn early 2013, Marlinspike left Twitter, forgoing about a million dollars in stock. (Anderson stayed at the company for another year.) Soon after, Marlinspike started a nonprofit, Open Whisper Systems, returning to work on the open-source versions of RedPhone and TextSecure.\n\nMarlinspike does not take credit for the growth of Signal in the twenty-tens. “I think it’s possible to look at technology in the same way that Marxists would talk about history, as this thing that has its own agency and force and inevitability,” he said. “It’s this thing that’s just happening, and you’re moving with it.” Instead, he cites a number of factors as having led to a resurgence of interest in encryption, including the rise of mobile devices, which offered software engineers a new forum in which to experiment, and the proliferation of chat applications. And, in the spring of 2013, Snowden, at the time a National Security Agency contractor and a former C.I.A. employee, disclosed classified information about the N.S.A.’s sprawling surveillance programs, which were bolstered by user data obtained from Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft, A.T. \u0026 T., and Verizon. Snowden revealed that the N.S.A. had subverted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (N.I.S.T.), a government agency that, among other things, developed guidelines for cryptography. The N.I.S.T.’s cryptography standards included four algorithms that generated random strings of numbers, which were used to encode data. The N.S.A. had created a backdoor to one of these algorithms, rendering it insecure. Until that point, Marlinspike said, the N.I.S.T. and other working groups “had a sort of monopoly on defining what was acceptable and thus what was possible.” He described what ensued as a “brief renaissance.”\n\nOpen Whisper Systems operated out of a rickety office in the Mission; a CrossFit gym directly above made the ceiling shake. It had a fiscal sponsor, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and ran on a shoestring budget, assisted by grants from the Shuttleworth Foundation, the Knight Foundation, and the Open Technology Fund. Marlinspike calculates that, in the organization’s first five years, there were, on average, “2.3 full-time software developers.” He worked on the TextSecure Protocol with Trevor Perrin, another cryptographer. Software protocols are robust descriptions of how systems should function; Marlinspike’s aim was to write something straightforward and compelling enough that other messaging platforms would want to adopt it, adding end-to-end encryption to their existing tools. At the time, most popular encryption protocols were designed for interactive applications that required all parties to be online simultaneously. These protocols included properties such as “forward secrecy”: the regular changing of secret keys over time, which corrected the vulnerability of using a single private key across all encrypted correspondence. TextSecure’s innovation was to adapt these protocols, and replicate their properties, for the mobile chat environment, in which conversations are asynchronous, long running, and unpredictable: connections drop; people come and go. Perrin told me, “Most prior systems put encryption in the foreground: users had to jump through hoops to create and manage their secret keys and other people’s keys.” He and Marlinspike had wanted their end-to-end encryption to work “so smoothly that it would be invisible.”\n\nIn late 2013, Marlinspike met Brian Acton, a founder of WhatsApp, and expressed interest in adding end-to-end encryption to the messaging service. Shortly thereafter, in early 2014, WhatsApp was acquired by Facebook, for twenty-two billion dollars. That year, Open Whisper Systems merged RedPhone and TextSecure into a single communication tool for Android and iOS, and called it Signal. Marlinspike spent much of 2015 making trips to Mountain View, where he worked closely with Acton on implementing the Signal Protocol in WhatsApp. Acton is about a decade older than Marlinspike, and in some ways his foil: a Stanford graduate who worked in security at Apple, Adobe, and Yahoo before launching his own company. Acton was taken with Marlinspike’s technical vision. “The dude can get stuff done with high quality and high output,” he said. “He naturally emerges as a leader because of his capability and his proficiency. To have done that with less formal training than the normal guy, I think, is outstanding.” He also liked Marlinspike’s low-key nature. “He’s a very thoughtful and conscientious person,” he said. “In corporate America, security incidents often result in what I would call the corporate freakout. A guy like Moxie is sort of unflappable.”\n\nIn 2017, Marlinspike and Perrin were awarded, for their work on the Signal Protocol, the Levchin Prize—a new accolade, established by the entrepreneur and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, for real-world applications of cryptography. During Marlinspike’s acceptance speech, which he requested go unrecorded, he deferred to history, saying that the celebration should be of technological progress rather than of any particular individual. Boneh, the Stanford professor, who chaired the award committee, said that the message was “really, really beautiful,” but he didn’t entirely buy the idea that, without Marlinspike, widespread end-to-end encryption would have been inevitable. “Maybe it is true, but it would have taken many more decades,” he said.\n\nThat year, Acton left Facebook, later attributing his departure to intractable differences about privacy practices. At the heart of the conflict was tension with Facebook’s top executives, Sheryl Sandberg and Mark Zuckerberg , who wanted to extend Facebook’s targeted-ad network to WhatsApp. End-to-end encryption precluded the collection of message content that would be valuable to advertisers. In early 2018, Acton and Marlinspike announced the formation of the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit. Acton, the foundation’s chairman and sole member, seeded it with a no-interest, fifty-million-dollar loan.\n\nActon and Marlinspike wanted to demonstrate that it is possible to build mainstream technology that is not beholden to the incentives of venture capital, or to markets, despite the overwhelming cost of producing and maintaining software. Signal has always been remote. Its nonprofit status protects it from outside interests demanding rapid returns. Nonprofits cannot be acquired by for-profit companies, so there will be no repeat of what happened between Whisper Systems and Twitter, or between WhatsApp and Facebook. Acton told me, “The user is the customer, and we can actually put them first in terms of what their needs and their desires are, rather than a corporate bottom line or a profit motive or anything else. To me, it’s a powerful message to deliver.”\n\nSignal is compensated for implementations of the Signal Protocol on a pay-as-you-wish basis. Skype has used the protocol for its “Private Conversations” setting, and Facebook Messenger has used it in a feature called “Secret Conversations”; Marlinspike declined to say how much either company donated. He thinks a lot about how to bring the Signal Protocol to the “long tail of the Internet”—the galaxy of smaller apps and services that could be encrypted, given enough time and resources. Signal’s employees are paid competitively; still, the organization has trouble vying with major corporations for engineers. As C.E.O., Marlinspike takes a salary in the low six figures, modest for the software industry, and makes less than the median salary at Facebook. He is still ambivalent about Silicon Valley’s professional security culture. He described recent industry conferences in Las Vegas, where, he said, “you’d go to this club and there’d be a bouncer with a velvet rope or whatever. I’d always want to ask the bouncer, ‘How can you take yourself seriously, man? You should be trying to prevent us from getting out. It’s, like, a negative-cool space inside.’ ”\n\nSignal now has thirty-six employees. Marlinspike told me that he tries to find ways to facilitate collective decision-making. Nora Trapp, Signal’s iOS lead, said, “If there has to be a person who is representing us, it’s good that Moxie is that person. But I also think that having just one individual serve that role is a little bit counter to the way we work and the way we function.” Perrin told me that, despite appearances, “Moxie leads from the front, and he just leads by doing. One of his favorite quotes is ‘The only secret is to begin.’ If you want to get good at something or do something, you just do it, and you figure it out along the way.”\n\nThere are inherent privacy challenges to digital communication: messages can still be screenshotted; devices can be stolen or hacked. Some members of the privacy community, including Snowden, criticize Signal’s requirement that each user sign up with a phone number; others object to Signal’s default setting that alerts users every time a contact joins the service. And, although all of Signal’s source code is open-source and peer-reviewed, most users cannot be certain whether it is identical to the code deployed in the apps they download, or to the code that is actually running on Signal’s servers. Others argue that Signal should be federated, or decentralized: rather than trusting a single organization to remain stable, invulnerable, uncompromised, and oriented toward their needs, participants should be able to run their own servers. (Signal maintains that this would be prohibitive to everyday users, and potentially more insecure.) Signal Fails, an anonymous zine recently published on several anarchist Web sites, warns against dependency on a centralized service, particularly one running on mobile devices. “If your device is compromised with a keylogger or other malicious software, it doesn’t really matter how secure your communications are,” the zine reads. Were anarchists to “pose a major threat to the established order,” the government would “come for us and our infrastructure without mercy.”\n\nMarlinspike defends centralization as a necessary condition for Signal’s widespread adoption, and for its ease of use. He is acutely aware that the reason encryption did not catch on in the nineties was that the cypherpunks expected users to adopt the conventions of software engineers, rather than the other way around. Most people did not want to teach themselves about cipher suites and ASCII armor in order to send a secure e-mail; they did not want to attend key-signing parties and exchange public cryptographic keys in order to build a web of trust. They just wanted to log on and talk to their friends. “Everyone who wasn’t Steve Jobs was wrong in the same kind of way,” Marlinspike said. Signal offers unusual features, such as messages that disappear after a set period of time; users recently asked for stickers, and these, too, needed to be end-to-end encrypted. For now, Signal’s engineers are working on improvements, such as developing a group-video-chat feature and making the app’s group-chat systems faster and more robust.\n\n“Anything you create in the technology landscape exists as part of an ecosystem, and the ecosystem is moving,” Marlinspike said. Signal is a paranoid software, constantly adapting to new threats. As he wrote in 2016 on the organization’s blog, “Networks evolve, security threats and countermeasures are in constant shift, and the collective UX”—user experience—“language rarely sits still.” He expressed envy of writers, musicians, and filmmakers: “Unlike software, when they create something, it is really done—forever. A recorded album can be just the same 20 years later, but software has to change.”\n\nRegulation remains a threat to Signal, although, Marlinspike said, “you can never get rid of cryptography. Sets of equations are everywhere. There’s no way for everyone in the world to unsee that, or to unknow it.” He seemed unfazed by the prospect that, if end-to-end encrypted communication does catch on more widely, Signal might someday become obsolete. “If we’ve pushed the envelope as far as we can go and the things we develop become as ubiquitous as possible, we could all focus on other things,” he said. As we walked around Venice, I tried to ask him about what those other things might be. His answers were a little vague. He is not interested in retiring, or relaxing; he still fears routine. “I’ve always been much better at doing than being,” he told me later. Referring to Fitzgerald’s “ This Side of Paradise ,” he explained that he has always seen himself more as a “personage” than as a “personality.” He mentioned, casually, that he is curious about life-extension research, because he believes the world would look different if people had more time to explore their interests, learn new skills, build expertise, and experiment. “I dread the minute hand hitting the top of the dial every hour,” he said. “I feel like I have less time than I used to. When you’re really young, no doors have really closed.”\n\nWhenever I asked Marlinspike what he had been up to, the answer was the same: “Work, work, work.” Wang, describing Marlinspike’s “masochistic anarchist workaholism,” told me, “I think the anarchy world rewards self-motivation, initiative, and experimentation. You oddly acquire a lot of skills that are useful, whether it’s graphic design or programming. There’s a strong work ethic, and a weird kind of anti-capitalist entrepreneurialism.” Reinhard said, of Marlinspike, “He is an incredibly efficient time manager, and he approaches his leisure in exactly the same way. Almost all of his adventures require, like, six months of planning—and he has the patience for it.”\n\nMarlinspike moved from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in 2018, in part to work on a side project with friends—an ecological restoration “experience” intended to mitigate the depletion of coastal kelp forests. Participants would spend three days earning their scuba certifications, then paddle out to nearshore ecosystems, exploring the kelp forests and planting spores. The project, Marlinspike said, was “at the confluence of a few things that I’m interested in, like ocean ecology, climate change, potential climate-change remediation.” Marlinspike’s close friend, who was also involved, said that the goal was for participants to be transformed: “What is the future of the world? Who are people in positions where they can change that future? How do we have those people do something that is going to change their world view, that might then change what they want to do?” The project fell through earlier this year, partly because of the pandemic but also because it is notoriously difficult to grow kelp from seed, and possibly illegal to plant it in the ocean at one’s leisure.\n\nDuring our conversations, Marlinspike avoided making declarative statements about his plans and frequently declined requests to put seemingly innocuous information on the record. When I returned to his personal writing, I felt almost taunted by its attention to detail. I was particularly drawn to a blog post about a bicycle trip he took last year with friends through the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, the eighteen-mile radius around the Chernobyl nuclear plant, in Ukraine, which was evacuated on April 27, 1986. (Access to the area, which is variously radioactive, is limited to maintenance crews, scientists, and scheduled guided tours.) Aided by a cheap compass, dust masks, and dosimeters, they slept in an abandoned apartment, surrounded by aging domestic detritus, and wandered through the buildings of Pripyat, the former factory town, at night. The Exclusion Zone was “paradise, but a paradise you can’t enjoy,” he wrote. “The experience is full of tensions. . . . You have to be careful about where you sit, what you eat, how you eat it, what you touch; which is—ironically—why it exists. The reason it’s so beautiful and so peaceful is precisely because we can’t consume it. Like, perhaps, all real paradises everywhere.”\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, the beaches in Los Angeles were closed. Unable to surf, Marlinspike bought a pair of Rollerblades and began taking nightly skates through Venice and Santa Monica, piping the techno-heavy soundtrack to “Hackers” out of a small speaker. He had wondered whether the pandemic would break something open. When the Black Lives Matter protests started, Signal employees began fielding requests and feedback from organizers, medics, and protesters. Trapp pulled an all-nighter to work on a new face-blurring tool, for strategic obfuscation of protest photographs, and Signal released it almost immediately. Ten years ago, it had been fringe to talk about abolishing the police or prisons. All of a sudden, people were forming mutual-aid networks and, although Marlinspike had no way of knowing this, forming cop-watch groups on Signal with names like Pig Sniffers. More Americans had begun to talk about the ways in which law enforcement is applied unevenly, arbitrarily, and unnecessarily. “I think those kinds of things are a silver lining to things being as bad as they are—being able to see and question the structures around us that have maybe not been serving us well,” Marlinspike said, during our third and final meeting in Venice.\n\nStill, much had stayed the same. He was startled to see protesters posing for photographs with the National Guard, as if the demonstrations were just another Abbot Kinney experience to be consumed and documented for social media. “In the nineties, there was this huge emphasis on the idea of self-publishing,” he said at one point. “This idea that, if everyone could be both a producer and a consumer of information, the world would be fundamentally different. That’s all of zine culture.” He went on, “That’s the world we got, in a lot of ways. The people from that scene didn’t anticipate this being the vector, but everyone more or less has access to the same publishing platform as the President of the United States.” He exhaled lightly. “What we didn’t necessarily anticipate, when everyone was so optimistic, was how little it would change things. The dream was always that, if someone in the suburbs of St. Louis got killed by a cop, immediately everyone would know about it. At the time, it was a sort of foregone conclusion that that would be enough.” “Enough for what?” I asked. “To prevent that from happening,” he replied, flatly.\n\nThat morning, Marlinspike seemed to be feeling expansive. He told a story about Patty Hearst, and another about the Soviet space dogs, and an anecdote about centralized hot water in Russia. As he spoke, he gesticulated theatrically, as if his arms had just been unlatched. I found this unnerving; it suggested that, during our other conversations, he had been practicing a well-honed restraint. The sun was out in full force, the air smelled like weed, and the wind carried the clicking sound of low-stakes skate tricks. Women wearing masks and bikinis rollerbladed along the boardwalk, past venders hawking novelty sunglasses, one-hitters, and onesies stamped with a low-resolution TikTok logo. As we turned toward the beach, Marlinspike stopped walking and looked up at the sky. A line of twelve military helicopters cruised over the ocean. “Crazy,” he said, shaking his head.\n\nWhen we sat down, he told me about a trip that he and a friend had taken to Abkhazia, in 2016, to attend the CONIFA World Football Cup, a soccer tournament for unrecognized states. Abkhazia, a separatist region of Georgia, lies on the coast of the Black Sea. It has only two embassies—one belonging to Russia, its economic patron, and another to the fellow breakaway republic South Ossetia—and few diplomatic relationships. It is recognized by only five U.N. member states, and is barely integrated into the world economy. “An interesting thing is, if you’re going to be a country, you need a bunch of stuff, right?” Marlinspike said. “You need a flag, you need a national bird, you need an anthem, and you have to have a soccer team.” He was wearing black jean shorts, and he bounced a finger against a tanned thigh for emphasis. “If you’re going to be a country, you’ve got to have a soccer team.”\n\nAbkhazia is the sort of place that appeals to Marlinspike: a would-be country outside the strictures of globalization, and almost outside the bounds of imagination. As the U.K. voted to exit the European Union, and the Catalan independence movement fought for autonomy from Spain, Marlinspike, who believes the world is seen most clearly from the margins, found that Abkhazia offered a unique perspective on nationalist and separatist movements. To get there, he and his companion travelled through southern Russia to a militarized border. After passing through three checkpoints, Marlinspike found himself in a landscape that looked exactly the same as the one where they had just been. People were speaking the same language. He wondered if the fight for independence—a brutal civil war, the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in the early nineties, and now economic isolation—had been worth it.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the stadium, in Sokhumi, the Abkhazian capital, the opening match was sold out. People were sitting in the aisles and hanging from the fences. Using elementary Russian, Marlinspike pleaded his case to a security guard. Not knowing what to make of two backpackers who had travelled from California expressly for the tournament, the guard waved them through the gates.

Peeling Back the PR - Reboot","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/karen-hao?s=r","content":"Today, we’re sharing a fantastic interview with Karen Hao on tech journalism, ethical career paths, and the search for values alignment across the board.\n\nKaren is the senior AI editor at the MIT Technology Review. She’s also an MIT Knight Science Journalism Fellow, wrote the newsletter The Algorithm , and co-produced the award-winning podcast In Machines We Trust . Prior to the Tech Review, she was a data scientist, an application engineer at the first startup to spin out of Alphabet’s X, and received her BS in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Energy Studies from MIT.\n\nKaren’s commitment to rigor, empathy, and curiosity is reflected both in her approach to reporting as well as to her thinking on ethical tech careers. She also offers a peek behind the curtain at the impactful yet often controversial work of tech journalism, and includes advice for aspiring journalists and technologists alike.\n\nThis event was facilitated by Reboot community member Archana Ahlawat for Reboot’s private community. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWelcome Karen, and thank you for being here! To start with, how did you begin your career path in tech?\n\nAfter college, I moved to San Francisco to work at startups. I was obsessed with how we could fight climate change, which is obviously a very long and laborious process, but I didn't see the venture capital model being the right vehicle for tackling longer term issues.\n\nI was at a company called flux.io, the first startup to spin out of Google X. Flux was trying to use technology to incentivize more sustainable architecture and urban development, so I thought it was the perfect alignment of technology with a problem that I wanted to solve. But Flux failed spectacularly. If you go on Google X’s website, it's scrubbed from ever existing. When it failed, it made me take a step back and think, Is the tech industry the right place for me?\n\nI had no idea what to do next. I thought, If I'm not going to be in the tech industry, what are spaces that are not as driven by a for-profit model? It came down to government, nonprofits, or journalism. But I didn't have a background in any of those worlds because I had been so focused on getting into the tech industry for so long.\n\nHow did you navigate your transition from engineering to journalism?\n\nI first started exploring journalism because I love writing and it was something that I'd always been curious about.\n\nIn the Bay Area, there are two strong journalism schools, one at Stanford and one at UC Berkeley. I took day trips to each of them, sat in on classes, and talked with students there about what it means to be a journalist and how I could marry what I want to do with a career in this world.\n\nAnd I just really fell in love with journalism. I loved the classes, I loved speaking with the students, I loved the way they were thinking about their role in society, and I was excited about being able to work for mission-driven organizations. In journalism, there is obviously a looming need to make money, but as a journalist, you're split from that. There's a strong divide between the business side and the editorial side.\n\nI didn't know any other journalists, so I went to the MIT alumni database and searched for every person that had ever done journalism. There were around 50 people in a span of 70 years, so I reached out to all of them. Maybe 15 people responded, so I got on calls to ask how they made the transition from studying engineering.\n\nTwo paths emerged. You either go to grad school or you keep writing, publishing, and trying to get an internship until you make it. I was like, Great, I don't have money to go to grad school, so I'll just write until I make it. I learned to write an article in an edX class, shopped that one article around, landed an unpaid internship, went from there to a fellowship, went from there to a staff job, and that's how I made my transition.\n\n“I’m not afraid of reading technical papers or talking to startup founders or engineers about how their technology works. So I started differentiating myself by digging into my technical background.”\n\nHow did you figure out the unique perspective you bring to writing about the tech industry?\n\nI originally wanted to be an environmental reporter, so my first unpaid internship was at the Sierra Club magazine.\n\nBut people don't hire environmental reporters. In 2016, everyone wanted tech reporters. It was when the techlash was starting, and there was a lot of interest in the tech industry, its culture, and new technologies like AI. Because of my resume, whenever I applied for jobs, they would ask me, “Do you want to be on the tech desk?”\n\nI took my first tech writing job pretty begrudgingly, but realized that I could make this into a strength. I’m not afraid of reading technical papers or talking to startup founders or engineers about how their technology works. So I started differentiating myself by digging into my technical background. Also, the reality of journalism is that you have to draw upon your network, and mine was in tech, so it was a lot faster for me to identify who I needed to talk to and get conversations.\n\nBut as I continued reporting, I realized that there was also a fundamental misunderstanding of the culture in the tech industry. Some of the smartest and kindest people I know work in tech. They have amazing intentions and then work for companies that do not benefit society in the ways that they espouse. I was fascinated by what was going wrong in this process. For people who haven’t been close to those who work in tech, there's a perception: What are these people doing? Why is this stuff always messed up? Maybe it's not about the people, it's about the systems that they're in.\n\nI also started thinking, What do I need to tell my friends in the tech industry about the world outside? A lot of people in tech get really insular. You're living in San Francisco, interacting with other tech people, and don't think about other perspectives. I wanted to write stories that help people who might be drinking the Kool Aid realize that there's other things they should be considering when they're building technology. I wanted more bridge-building and conversations on both sides of the aisle.\n\nIt does seem like there are fewer such gaps in tech reporting now — many journalists have a more holistic grasp of the industry. Where do you see that there's still work to be done?\n\nThere are a lot of parallels with the tech industry. In tech, we're seeing younger technologists question whether technology is truly neutral, like there's bias that's embedded within these technologies.\n\nIn journalism, the same transition happened. Old school journalists considered themselves to be very objective. They would act like they don't have a position.\n\nI’d consider myself as part of a younger generation of journalists throwing that out the window. There's an argument behind the things that I write — I'm always very clear about what my position is. I don't think that I'm neutral, and I don't think that I should pretend that I am. But I strive to be fair and honor a multiplicity of perspectives.\n\n“I try very much to respect the people I talk to, even if I'm critiquing the systems or the company that they're part of.”\n\nThere's a lot of PR and narrative-building coming from the tech industry, yet you also seem to have a strong sense of what's going on within the academic sphere. How do you manage that?\n\nIt's really just a race to keep on top of all the AI research that comes out.\n\nWhen I started covering AI, I would read five or ten papers a week, then get on calls with researchers at the forefront of their fields. Once I was able to build a core understanding of AI’s limitations and capabilities, it was easy to see a startup saying “We're going to solve AGI in two years” and think, That's an interesting claim that most of the research community does not agree with.\n\nOver the years, I’ve developed a lot of good friendships with AI researchers, so I'm always checking in to ask: What's new? What do I need to know about? How are things shifting? All the best tech reporters do that. They stay close to the research and have their own understanding of it before they start talking with companies or PR people that have the financial incentive to aggrandize what they're working on.\n\nIt can be exhausting. There were times when I would go on vacation for a week and feel like I missed an entire shift of the industry.\n\nHow do you maintain relationships with the tech industry despite some of their skepticism of the media?\n\nWhen I write something that brings PR jargon down to reality, I've never had someone get upset. They respect that my articles are technically grounded. Sometimes, in a call with a company representative, I'll ask about the technical details and it’ll catch them off guard — I understand more than they thought I did. Then, they’ll tell me a bit more about the honest capabilities of their system, and that's how I gain respect and trust with those individuals.\n\nIn cases where I've had a more contentious story-writing process, most recently with Facebook, I try very much to respect the people, even if I'm critiquing the systems or the company that they're part of. It's a hard balance to strike. I don't know that I always do it correctly, but at the end of the day, I still feel comfortable calling up the individual that I spoke to and feeling like I honored them as a person. Even if I am very harsh on the things they did, I try to be clear that their actions don't necessarily make them evil or bad.\n\nHow do you research questions that require access to corporate data?\n\nI try to be realistic about what I have access to at the start of a story. I wrote a piece about how Facebook Instant Articles is funding misinformation in the Global South, and that was based on open source data and the CrowdTangle API. I scoped the story based on exactly what I knew was in CrowdTangle.\n\nSo one limitation of reporting on companies from the outside is that you have to work with what you're given.\n\nHow do you sift through everything going on in the tech industry to choose what to focus on?\n\nSomething that really surprised me when I came into journalism was how subjective everything is. It’s just based on what I'm interested in. I spend a lot of my time absorbing information, having calls, reading papers, looking at the news, and just keeping a pulse on conversations. When things grab my attention, I’ll start to chase.\n\nI always try to think back to my ultimate goal. I gravitate towards stories that reveal how tech culture shapes technology and how technology impacts people. I also consider: If I didn't write the story, would someone else be able to? Is there a particular thing I have that would help me write the story in a way I think is valuable, whether that's access to particular people or the technical ability to explain a complicated concept?\n\n“There's an argument behind the things that I write — I'm always very clear about what my position is. I don't think that I'm neutral, and I don't think that I should pretend that I am. But I strive to be fair.”\n\nHow do you think the training of engineers impacts the culture of the tech industry?\n\nOne of the most obvious things in my undergrad was that I never had to take a single ethics class. At MIT, we had a humanities and social sciences requirement, but the culture within the student body was that these classes were a joke. That directly feeds into some of the challenges we see in the tech industry where people don't value certain types of expertise that are core to building technologies that are better for humanity.\n\nThe other thing that bothered me when I was at MIT was the career fairs. It was this huge thing with hundreds of companies. You're trying to figure out how to make a career after four grueling years of education: what's going to pay you, what other people see as exciting and prestigious. When you walk into the fair, tech companies like Snapchat have the largest crowds. There were never any social impact companies or opportunities, so you just assume that they don't exist.\n\nIf I knew then that you could be a tech-interested person not directly in the Silicon Valley startup industry, I might have tried a whole assortment of other things. But they don't show up in these signaling venues, so students don't think about those opportunities.\n\nDo you think if you had graduated at this time, you would find more values alignment in the tech industry?\n\nNo, I don’t think so. I have friends who are excited about using data science for social impact, but also really want to do technically challenging work. There's only so many companies that you can do that at, so they move from like Facebook to Twitter to whatever, and ultimately, those aren't companies I think I would want to stay at.\n\nInstead of journalism, I probably would have ended up at a research institute or think tank at the intersection of tech and policy — things I didn't know existed in college. Maybe I would have stayed, or who knows, maybe I would have become a journalist anyway.\n\nFor more perspectives on the social impact of journalism (and people who read more than I ever will), listen to Ezra Klein’s conversation with the 80,000 Hours podcast .\n\nWorried about catching Omicron?

in virtual worlds - by nancy zuo","link":"https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/capitalism-in-virtual-worlds?s=r","content":"capitalism in virtual worlds on my mmorpg-pilled childhood\n\nI’m writing this piece as a tribute to my hours spent on MMORPG games, and as a personal reflection after having been thrown back to my fascination with virtual worlds after having experienced the VR equivalent of MMOs recently (VRChat, thanks to Anthony ).\n\nI spent thousands of hours throughout the summer of 4th grade through 6th grade in these games. Convinced that this was obstructing my performance in my classes and other productive activities in the summer, my dad actively blocked each new MMO website he found on my computer so I couldn’t get my fix of dopamine each day from completing my login streaks.\n\nPart of my appeal in spending time in these virtual worlds was the lack of an ability to explore the outside world on my own. At the unripe age of 10, I wasn’t able to walk many places in my uneventful suburban town, didn’t have friends living right next door, and didn’t have any actual work to do. I wanted to explore the world, but was trapped in my room with my computer. Playing these games became a refuge from my boredom and my personal on-demand portal to the outside world.\n\nThe MMOs I played the most were Fantage and Club Penguin. Fantage was an MMO with a range of minigames and activities to accrue digital currency in a world and dress as a virtual avatar. Club Penguin was the same as Fantage but penguins.\n\nIn both Fantage and Club Penguin, there was a social hierarchy in the haves and have-nots. The haves were the cooler kids that had access to a credit card to purchase a premium membership or in-game currency. The have-nots didn’t have the approval of a parent to purchase virtual clothing and avatar upgrades.\n\nI quickly realized how much extra features the premium members got that I didn’t get. I didn’t know it at the time, but I had experienced the social inequality of having to work more time for less pay (through playing the mini-games for in-game currency), while the upper class elite premium members were able to breeze by and purchase their clothing for less with an alternate in-game currency called “e-coins.”\n\nIn order to climb up the social hierarchy to these games without being a “premium member”, I spent more hours playing the mini-games, and making a smaller fraction of the in-game currency as a normal free member for each run-through. I was gated from having the power to purchase goods that were reserved for the elite. I saw value in owning those exclusive jpegs to put on my character, and I wanted those jpegs in context because I wanted to be a part of them.\n\nEven as an unknowing tween, I knew I wanted to be a premium member because I would have a much better experience playing the game. My dad wouldn’t budge no matter how hard I explained my reasoning or bargained with chores to pay for a premium membership. I decided I had to take matters into my own hands. I scoured the internet for tutorials on finding hacks or bugs that weren’t patched to gain access to a free membership. I scoured forums where people posted the logins to their old accounts and for redemption codes to premium subscriptions. I took online surveys for tokens to redeem for gift cards, but much of it wasn’t enough to redeem for a subscription. In the end, none of my endeavors succeeded and I was still stuck as a normal member. The digital paywall was too high to climb over as a credit-card-less 10 year old.\n\nMuch of this gated access to digital goods reminds me of present day gated online crypto communities. In Friends with Benefits , a cultural membership-based DAO, you are required to possess set number of tokens to join the community and access the resources within. The value of the community comes from the desire from those outside to be a part of it, and the value is there because of how people place value in it. It’s like “paying the digital rent” to invest in a property as a member of the community and selling it off after leaving the community, with the expectation that the token value will grow stronger with the people and network over time.\n\nOn the flip side, my experience in VRChat was much different. In VRChat, you embody a 3D avatar and teleport into 3D worlds that are community-created. There are no classes for digital goods, and anyone can fully express themselves with any avatar available in the community without restriction. My first experience felt unusual because I wasn’t used to everything being ungated and free for use. I realized I had become used to better digital goods being gated and inaccessible to the public when I felt weird taking all the digital goods without pay.\n\nIn the digital world of Discord servers, DAOs, and VRChat worlds that represent online cities and countries with tokens or in-game currency as the currency of virtual nation-communities, I’m constantly reminded that we need not carry the same mistakes of the real world into the digital world. Instead, I’m curious on what a model that would not be a repeat of hyper-capitalism would look like. It didn’t take understanding a capitalistic system fully to feel insecure about inequality in my childhood MMOs. I’m continually learning the economics of what the future of organization might look like, and am hopeful that there is a balance between keeping a community in check and in creating inclusion.\n\nmoving to nyc for two months this thursday on a whim (I decided to this weekend despite originally going for only a week), thank you ami \u0026 together for connecting me with ben from nyc edyfi\n\nstarted going to physical therapy for my neck pain (thank you chris and jerry ) and got a neck warmer thing that has been very helpful\n\ngot to try a three-monitor setup in a personal workspace (that I am sadly abandoning since I’m moving to nyc, so sorry john choi )\n\nsuccessfully survived 2 final round interviews last monday (4 interviews in one day) and got my first summer internship offer!!\n\nwatched dune and realized how much I do not understand sci-fi\n\nhosted a really wholesome ux speed friending event on campus with an amazing team from uxa , and handed out custom stickers + pins!!\n\ngave my first in-person workshop/lecture on portfolios + the meaning of life (am working on a medium post recap + editing the recording)\n\nlearned how to successfully create discord bot reaction roles to unlock channels\n\nnow proudly own my first nft (thank you deve 💖) and custom ens\n\nfilmed a day in the life at cmu video that I am working on (thought it’d be funny to do one as a non-student)\n\nam now proudly representing figma as a student leader at cmu despite probably not being here for the next almost year (watch-out for workshops!)\n\nvisited a salad farm in which all the salads are 100% grown indoors vertically farmed by robots :O\n\nfinally taking care of my health more\n\nsuccessfully solved and passed four hard problems in a ritual to be onboarded for a discord group I was invited to\n\nThanks so much for reading this if you made it this far!

In the back of your mind, you’ll probably be evaluating them — “Could I be friends with this person?”. To paint a picture of what they’re like, you might start to pattern-match their behaviour to other people you’ve known, and make inferences about their character based on the vibe they give off.\n\nThis guy is really into football and beer — he’s probably a douche. This girl is interesting and attractive — she probably thinks you’re lame. This group is talking about Bitcoin — tiresome. Of course, there are also positive signals that might draw you to people — shared interests, a particular sense of humour, and intangible good vibes.\n\nIf you hit it off with someone, then great! But if a few red flags crop up, you might politely excuse yourself from the conversation and go talk to other people.\n\nAt a dinner gathering, this would be harder — there might only be a couple of different conversations going on, with moving between them non-trivial. A group holiday would make it harder still — over 10 days you’ll end up spending a lot of time with everyone, no matter what. And on a desert island, there’s nowhere to even go.\n\nAt the very least, less social optionality forces you to spend more time with people, putting less emphasis on the initial interaction. This is a good thing — I think first impressions are largely a reflection of our own biases, and that most people take a little while to get comfortable enough to reveal their “authentic selves”.\n\nMore important than this, I think less optionality actually makes us view our interactions in a different way.\n\nAt a party, you know you can walk away from anyone and probably never see them again. At a dinner gathering, less so — you’re stuck with them for the evening — but you can wait it out. On a group holiday, you’re stuck with them for 10 days. And marooned on an island, maybe forever.\n\nBecause of this, your frame of mind on the desert island turns from “Could I be friends with this person?” to “How can I connect with this person?”.\n\nIf you know that you’ll be with someone for 10 days, or maybe the rest of your life, it’s in both of your best interests to find a way to valuably connect. Low optionality encourages the long game.\n\nWanting to connect for no other reason than because you’re two human beings on the same floating rock — this is the intention with which I’d like to approach all social interactions. Low optionality situations make this significantly easier, and I’ve started prioritising them when choosing how to spend my time.\n\nThe man whom I look at with dread or hope, with greed, designs, or demands, is not a man but a cloudy mirror of my own desire.\n\nWhether I am aware of it or not, I regard him in the light of questions that limit and falsify: Is he approachable, or arrogant? Does he respect me? Is he a good prospect for a loan? Does he understand anything about art? A thousand such questions are in our minds as we look at most people we have to deal with…\n\nAt the moment when desire ceases and contemplation, pure seeing, and self-surrender begin, everything changes. Man ceases to be useful or dangerous, interesting or boring, genial or rude, strong or weak. He becomes nature, he becomes beautiful and remarkable as does everything that is an object of clear contemplation. For indeed contemplation is not scrutiny or criticism, it is nothing but love. It is the highest and most desirable state of our souls undemanding love.\n\nthanks for reading!","tokenFrequency":{"inde":1,"thing":1,"life":1,"choos":1,"still":1,"way":3,"flag":1,"guy":1,"talk":2,"thousand":1,"danger":1,"let":1,"paint":1,"put":1,"parti":2,"follow":1,"impress":1,"bias":1,"island":4,"float":1,"you'v":1,"“could":2,"convers":2,"intang":1,"import":1,"dread":1,"give":1,"they'r":1,"excus":1,"human":1,"pictur":1,"best":1,"understand":1,"back":1,"mirror":1,"tiresom":1,"nontrivi":1,"soul":1,"meet":1,"sometim":1,"know":2,"actual":1,"consid":1,"signific":1,"degre":1,"evalu":1,"harder":2,"option":6,"art":1,"forc":1,"turn":1,"infer":1,"mayb":2,"great":1,"respect":1,"you'll":3,"connect":3,"game":1,"":17,"friend":2,"littl":1,"intent":1,"desir":3,"lot":1,"douch":1,"start":2,"chang":1,"footbal":1,"i'v":1,"rest":1,"you'r":4,"encourag":1,"easier":1,"reflect":1,"noth":1,"vibe":2,"wait":1,"lowest":1,"particular":1,"“how":1,"forev":1,"scrutini":1,"feel":1,"i'd":1,"10":3,"use":1,"mind":3,"love":2,"order":1,"he":1,"awar":1,"differ":4,"contempl":3,"—":12,"greed":1,"cours":1,"two":1,"beauti":1,"might":5,"read":1,"peopl":6,"say":1,"someon":4,"everyth":2,"cloudi":1,"approach":3,"low":2,"selfsurrend":1,"patternmatch":1,"be":1,"critic":1,"rude":1,"whether":1,"arrog":1,"light":1,"situat":3,"abandon":1,"frame":1,"gather":2,"holiday":2,"polit":1,"time":3,"object":1,"dinner":2,"valuabl":1,"girl":1,"weak":1,"end":1,"interact":4,"rock":1,"social":5,"design":1,"go":3,"look":2,"becom":2,"person”":3,"coupl":1,"question":2,"everyon":1,"view":1,"demand":1,"us":1,"freeli":1,"anoth":1,"“authent":1,"first":1,"walk":1,"maroon":1,"sincer":1,"sens":1,"falsifi":1,"red":1,"signal":1,"charact":1,"group":3,"reason":1,"anyth":1,"matter":1,"pure":1,"hit":1,"good":3,"least":1,"like":3,"abil":1,"crop":1,"selves”":1,"spend":3,"share":1,"ceas":2,"also":1,"reveal":1,"comfort":1,"known":1,"bitcoin":1,"probabl":4,"it":1,"attract":1,"highest":2,"realli":1,"genial":1,"want":1,"anyon":1,"loan":1,"natur":1,"moment":1,"away":1,"interest":4,"hope":1,"thank":1,"see":2,"one":1,"undemand":1,"initi":1,"limit":1,"prospect":1,"beer":1,"enough":1,"never":1,"lame":1,"long":1,"stuck":3,"desert":3,"there":1,"larg":1,"clear":1,"state":1,"move":1,"posit":1,"less":4,"prioritis":1,"take":1,"strong":1,"new":1,"think":3,"regard":1,"even":2,"deal":1,"base":1,"bore":1,"emphasi":1,"behaviour":1,"draw":1,"man":3,"make":4,"find":1,"day":3,"truli":1,"persongroup":1,"nowher":1,"humour":1,"with…":1,"begin":1,"remark":1,"get":1,"would":2}},"24946":{"id":"24946","title":"A Highly-Regarded Man of Letters","link":"https://pketh.org/a-man-of-letters.html","content":"Somewhere in an old issue of Monkey Business , a journal of Japanese fiction, an editor was introduced as\n\nMotoyuki Shibata, one of Japan’s most highly regarded men of letters.\n\nSomething about the description stuck with me ever since.

It was the first smart contract I had ever written—about a week or two into knowing what a smart contract was at all. An experience better not repeated, decidedly, but an edifying one nonetheless.\n\nThe cryptic art of spellcasting in Solidity can be inscrutable at the surface, but we were able to draw from a collective pool of wisdom that deepens daily… and so we bring our own to you, young arcanists. Here is the story of a contract cast into the ether to bring to life a coven, as well as the trials encountered along the way—the curse of the void witch, and their untimely return.\n\nIt was a few weeks before the Halloween launch of Crypto Coven and, thus, the date at which we were meant to deploy the smart contract for our collection of WITCHES.\n\nThe catch? There was no smart contract; and, frankly, we weren’t yet sure what exactly a smart contract was.\n\nWe had begun working on the project in mid-September, and there was a seemingly infinite amount to do—drawing art, sculpting a generator, weaving lore, creating a website, and so on. As arcanists with keen competencies in web development, the generator and the website were easy (and, granted, crucial) places to focus our energies. They were already enough work on their own that we had been pulling four a.m. nights for weeks. The smart contract, by contrast, was uncharted territory. We regarded it with no slight amount of trepidation, and so we procrastinated on it until we had simply no other recourse but to dust off the sacred tomes and, well, learn what it meant to write code on the blockchain.\n\nOf course, we could have just used a platform like OpenSea or Zora rather than develop a contract from scratch—but we wanted to write our own. For one, a major part of why we had undertaken this project at all was to explore and experiment with the blockchain as a medium. Intrigued by the possibilities that emerged out of permissionless code and decentralized data, we sought to understand the technologies underpinning them more deeply for ourselves. More than that, we weren’t just dropping a collection of WITCHES—we were crafting a world around them. Having our own contract would enable us to design the entire experience around the summoning of a WITCH, setting the tone for the community we hoped to manifest by offering an early glimpse into the weird wilds.\n\nWith that aim, I first set out to get a technical base of the problem space, starting with just one Saturday spent perusing the entirety of the Ethereum Foundation docs on the subject.\n\nWhat is a smart contract? It’s a misnomer, really. A smart contract is a program that lives and stores its data on the blockchain, typically with APIs to interact with its contents. Poking around contracts on Etherscan makes that much clearer; you can see the entirety of the code for a verified contract, as well as call read and write functions on them.\n\nWhat, then, is a non-fungible token (NFT)? It’s a record of ownership created and stored within a smart contract that follows a particular standard ( ERC-721 ), and it can point to anything—an image, a song, an HTML page, and so on. Unlike cryptocurrencies, where tokens are interchangeable (fungible), NFTs reference unique objects.\n\nEven as competent engineers, we initially struggled with the specifics of how NFTs works—in part because it’s so simple that it’s counterintuitive. It was hard to believe that that was it. Most NFTs are just pointers: a blockchain-based database entry that points to content somewhere else on the internet. On-chain NFTs are the exception; the content itself lives on the blockchain, not just a pointer to it, but that also means that the content is limited to formats that can feasibly be stored, given the size limitations of the blockchain (i.e., vector or pixel art rather than high-res raster art).\n\nBut for our project, for instance, there is absolutely nothing in the smart contract that defines what makes a WITCH—there are just arbitrary IDs (1 through 9,999). Everything about a particular witch exists at the URI at which the smart contract points. That meant that the surrounding infrastructure we needed to write was more fragile and more complex, but the work of writing the contract was relatively straightforward.\n\nAfter developing a high-level understanding of smart contracts and NFTs, I started looking through existing contracts, from older, well-known projects like Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Blitmaps to projects that were just launching at the time, like Doodles. Seeing real code bridged a lot of the gaps in my mental model. Nyx and I had worked to sketch out the functionality we wanted in our smart contract; browsing other projects’ contracts on Etherscan helped to see countless examples of different implementations and feature sets.\n\nAs much as we gleaned from all this prior work, perhaps one takeaway was even more salient: not every contract is well-written, and in fact even common practices can be anti-patterns. This space is still early, and many of the people deploying to mainnet are, like us, new to developing on Ethereum—which means that it’s important to never assume that even a well-known project necessarily has good code. Understanding the fundamentals rather than replicating code can be essential to ensure that you aren’t copying inefficient, incorrect, or (worst of all) insecure code.\n\nWe had a few aims with minting: we wanted to support both a community sale (limited to a list of addresses) and a public sale, with a three-WITCH-per-wallet limit across both.\n\nFiguring out the public sale and the per-wallet limit were trivial. Figuring out how to limit minting for the community sale to a list of addresses, though, posed a more complicated question. Few of the contracts I read included logic for limiting minting to a list of addresses.\n\nBut when I tweeted a different question, asking how people usually implemented airdrops, indreams.eth shared Mirror’s DroppableEditionsLogic contract . I scrutinized it with acolytes Oizys and Enthea , breaking down each function to understand how it worked. We focused on purchaseWithProof() , learning what a Merkle tree was. But even after we understood what it was, we still didn’t understand why this seemingly convoluted logic was necessary. Without any reference points, we kept wondering: why not just write this code, the obvious solution?\n\nAfter some experimenting with code, the reason quickly became clear: gas. The cost of storing so much data on-chain was astronomical. It was perhaps the first revelation we had about how writing Solidity differed from most of the code we’d written in the past. Storing a whole list of addresses just to check whether a given address should be able to mint was a really inefficient use of on-chain storage. Instead, we could use a Merkle tree and only store the root of the tree.\n\nWith gifting, we wanted to be able to support airdrops and claim drops. In a “true” airdrop, the project takes on the cost of gas and directly sends tokens to recipients. In a claim drop, the recipient covers gas.\n\nWe wanted the flexibility of these different options because, around the time the project was launching, gas was particularly high. On one hand, we were super low on funds and weren’t sure if we could feasibly take on the cost of airdropping gifts to people. On the other hand, many of the people we wanted to gift were new to NFTs, and, in an environment where a few hundred dollars to mint an NFT wasn’t out of the question, making the experience as frictionless as possible was important to us.\n\nIn retrospect, we probably spent too much time optimizing for this question—it was a relatively minor feature in the grand scheme of everything, and we overcomplicated the contract by deploying it with multiple gifting implementations. With smart contracts, simplicity can be key, especially when it comes to functionality as core as minting, but more on that later.\n\nOne recurring question I had as I browsed examples of ERC-721 contracts was: where are all the royalties? None of the contracts I reviewed had any mention of royalties written into them. Because of that, it was difficult to even learn what percentage royalties a given project received.\n\nWe realized that the state of royalties at the time that we were writing our contract wasn’t what we had expected—marketplaces like OpenSea had off-chain implementations, and the one on-chain royalty standard ( EIP-2891 ) that existed was strictly opt-in. In other words, royalties (an oft-touted benefit of NFTs for artists!) only existed at the discretion of third-party implementations that decided to respect them.\n\nStill, a standard for on-chain royalties was certainly preferable to the alternative, so we decided to implement it.\n\nBecause we were writing and deploying our own contract, by default, people wouldn’t be able to list their WITCHES on OpenSea without paying gas. But we had noticed in their docs , sparse as they were about the specifics and why any of it was necessary in the first place, that we had the option to lower this friction by allowing gasless listings. Oizys was able to piece together what we needed to do to enable the functionality: override the isApprovedForAll() function to allowlist the OpenSea proxy registry address.\n\nWe were never expecting an instant sellout for the project, nor was that our aim, which meant that we needed some way to slowly unveil new WITCHES and ensure that minters received a random WITCH (rather than competing to snipe the most desirable WITCHES).\n\nThat would be simple enough if we were hosting our metadata on our own servers. But we had decided to use IPFS , a distributed, peer-to-peer file storage system. That complicated matters to some extent. IPFS works by using content-addressed storage—in other words, all files that live on IPFS are hashed, producing a unique identifier based on the specific content of that file, and that determines its “address” on IPFS.\n\nIn our case, each time we wanted to make changes to the metadata (i.e., by replacing placeholder WITCHES with revealed ones), we would need to upload a new directory containing all of our metadata files—which meant that the IPFS address would change, which then meant that the contract would need to point to the new one. Because of that, we had to be able to update the base URI rather than have it hardcoded into the contract.\n\nOur acolyte Enthea wrote a script to programmatically reveal batches of WITCHES, reading the number of WITCHES already minted to the contract and then populating the directory of minted witches with the correct metadata, creating placeholders for all the others. We then uploaded a new directory to IPFS each time and updated the base URI in the contract to reflect the new address for the metadata.\n\nLowering gas usage was a high priority for us, given that gas fees had become so onerous around the time that we were launching. At the time, gas hovered solidly at hundreds of gwei, often even spiking to the thousands.\n\nThere were a few different ways we attempted to tackle the issue—compiling the contract with Hardhat using gas optimization for 100,000 runs, minimizing data storage with the Merkle tree for the community sale, and looking into best practices for airdrops (specifically, where we covered gas) to make them more financially viable.\n\nFor this last case, we spent a huge amount of time implementing different methods for airdrops and comparing gas usage between them, to see if there was a way to get the best of both worlds. We spent days experimenting with different options, ranging from exploring Cargo’s batch transfer EIP to... just minting on a for loop. Underwhelmingly, sequentially minting with a for loop turned out to be the most gas-efficient option.\n\nOizys, meticulous arcanist that they are, brought up testing. We needed to be able to easily write tests for the contract to ensure that we didn’t break anything as we made changes.\n\nWhat that meant for the contract was moving some of the variables we had hardcoded ( maxWitches , maxCommunitySaleWitches , and maxGiftedWitches ) into the constructor. The tradeoff was that it made it harder to read these values at a glance, but it became easier and faster to write tests checking key logic, like what should happen when we hit each of these limits. And, in fact, we did catch several off-by-one bugs this way before we shipped the contract. Tests! They work.\n\nAnd, finally, transparency. We wanted the limits we’d set for ourselves to be clearly encoded in the contract (i.e., the total number of WITCHES we could ever gift). We hadn’t seen that in any of the contracts we read; the owners of contracts could typically reserve an arbitrary number of tokens for themselves—in BAYC’s case, an infinite number of tokens because the owner-only function wasn’t subject to the max total tokens check.\n\nSimilarly, once all the WITCHES were revealed, we wanted to add a verification hash for all the images (which are currently hosted on S3) so that anyone could confirm in the future that they hadn’t been modified.\n\nLate on the night before Halloween, we finally had a contract that had been heavily tested locally and on testnet. It was time to deploy.\n\nWe opened the community sale, to no small amount of chaos—there were a few bugs in the minting UI (notably, that the addresses for the community sale were case-sensitive), but people were finally able to begin summoning their WITCHES.\n\nOizys and I stayed awake until five a.m. that morning, debugging issues and pushing fixes, but at that level of fatigue, we were breaking more than we were fixing. At some point, everyone started experiencing issues with minting. We decided to figure it out in the morning.\n\nThe next day, after a few hours of sleep, I quickly realized what had been wrong—we had reverted to an incorrect Merkle tree at some point the previous night, which is why all minting was failing rather than just some of it. I recreated the tree and added the correct root to the contract, and after we redeployed to the website, we announced that minting was fixed. All was well.\n\nWe had decided to do a few batch reveals that same day (rather than have people wait) to commemorate the occasion. The first went smoothly on our end—I updated the metadata and set a new base URI pointing to the new IPFS directory without any issues. But it was taking an unsettlingly long amount of time to update on OpenSea.\n\nWe kept pressing the refresh metadata button, to no avail, and we were searching for what might be wrong when we came across a (spoiler: incorrect) writeup about how IPFS files couldn’t include file extensions. Then, when we tested the token URI with OpenSea’s validator, it threw an exception, unable to pull the metadata. The .json extension was written directly into our tokenURI() function. Did we make an error that would prevent the WITCHES from ever rendering?\n\nLuckily, it was just OpenSea’s slow queueing to process metadata refreshes, and within the hour, the unveiled WITCHES began to appear.\n\nIn retrospect, this panic didn’t make any sense—the metadata for the placeholder was working perfectly, for one. But we were exhausted and paranoid, and our first WITCH unveiling had stalled. It was our first post-deployment panic over a bug in immutable code; it wouldn’t be the last.\n\nAs people unveiled their WITCHES, the tension and stress of the day dissipated. The reception was glowing, and I was floating on the high, dizzy from the whiplash of emotions. The remainder of the day passed in a blur, with each subsequent reveal unfolding smoothly. I decided to go to bed early that evening but first wanted to send out the WITCHES we had been planning to gift to the friends of the coven on launch day.\n\nI went to Etherscan to call the giftWitches() function in our contract, but when I attempted to pass it the full list of addresses (eighteen), I was hit with an impossibly high gas fee and an ambiguous error. Tired, I opted to deal with it in the morning.\n\nThe next morning, I woke, ready to figure out the gifting at last. I still had no idea what could possibly be wrong; I wondered vaguely if there might be an issue with one of the addresses or even the number of addresses in the list. I started testing the function with different combinations of addresses, with differing outcomes. With just the first half of the addresses, everything looked fine. Swapping some of the addresses worked as well. Without a definitive answer, I decided to mint to the addresses that looked fine, the first half. All good.\n\nI checked the transaction to see if it had been successful. It had, but upon looking more closely, I noticed that two of the WITCHES hadn’t been gifted after all. We had skipped over two IDs entirely.\n\nWhat happened? Skimming the function, I remembered that we’d implemented a per-wallet limit for gifting as well as for minting in the community and public sales; two of the people we had intended to gift had already minted three WITCHES in the community sale in the short time that it had been open. Disappointing, but not the end of the world.\n\nI turned back to the second half of the addresses. Except, this time, none of them worked—not a single one could be minted without triggering the astronomical gas fee.\n\nWith a growing sense of doom, I decided to call giftWitches() from the command line to see if that would work. Immediately, there, I saw the real error that using Etherscan and Metamask had buried:\n\nThat wasn’t what I had been expecting to see, at all. Suddenly I had a flash of understanding and rushed back to the contract code to reread the function, line by line. How could we be minting a token that had already been minted?\n\nAs I read, the situation became clearer, but only to our detriment.\n\nHere was the function I had called:\n\nThere was one crucial error in this code and then one design choice that made it irreparable.\n\nFirst, we included a check for the per-wallet limit in a for loop and relied on the iterator to assign IDs—which meant that IDs could be skipped, not a desirable behavior under any circumstance.\n\nSecond, we were using totalSupply() to assign token IDs because we had assumed that the total supply would always be equal to the last token ID we had minted.\n\nBut now we were stuck in a situation where we had a total supply of 135 WITCHES, but the last token ID that had been minted was 137. We had skipped 130 and 135, and there was already a token with the ID 136, which the contract considered the “next” token ID. It was an infuriatingly simple bug, one that could have been easily fixed if we had thought to test that edge case.\n\nBut we hadn’t, and the contract was trapped in this state, unable to ever mint again—the crisis we had been so relieved to avert just the prior day had come to pass.\n\nSo it had happened—our contract had hit a snag that would force us to redeploy after the community had already summoned WITCHES. What now?\n\nThe high witches flew into action. Nyx posted a pronouncement notifying the community that minting was on pause as we investigated a flaw in our gifting logic, and we started reaching out to all the people we knew who might be able to help us figure out a fix.\n\nOizys and I analyzed our options to see if there was any way at all that we could circumvent the bug within the contract. Could we burn all the tokens after the first gap in IDs to reset it to a pre-broken state? Could we deploy a new contract but have it delegate back to the v1 contract for tokens that had already been minted? Redeploying the contract and re-minting all the tokens that had already been minted felt prohibitively expensive—it could exhaust all the funds we had earned from the mint thus far.\n\nAfter we announced that minting was paused, one Discord user named mersenne inquired about the nature of the bug. They had noticed another potential issue in the contract upon reading it on Etherscan: namely, that the community sale could be drained if a malicious user who had added their address to our community list minted three WITCHES, transferred them to another wallet, and then repeated the process.\n\nIn a frankly implausible stroke of luck, this random person who had only just wandered into the Discord an hour earlier turned out to be Matthew Di Ferrante , an experienced Solidity auditor and developer who had been contributing to the Ethereum ecosystem for years. He offered to help us figure out what to do in exchange for a custom WITCH ; we agreed, gladly.\n\nWith someone with, well, more than a few weeks of experience with writing code on Ethereum, the necessary course of action quickly became clear. We would need to redeploy and roll over all the WITCHES that had already been minted. Outside of the contract, then, we would need to replace the art for the tokens on the v1 contract and (ideally) integrate it into the lore for the world we were building.\n\nNyx went to work on writing a post explaining the situation to the community. Aletheia started developing the art for what would become the soul vessels —decadent bejeweled vials containing the souls of the WITCHES lost to the ether. Aradia delved into the world-building around the soul vessels, while Keridwen put her pen to weaving the lore behind the so-called VOID WITCH who had snatched these lost WITCHES.\n\nOnce we had solidified a plan, Nyx shared out the update to everyone affected, along with what they should expect: that they would be granted new copies of their WITCHES as tokens on another contract, and the WITCHES they had would be turned into soul vessels to commemorate minting at launch. We were terrified of how people might respond to the news.\n\nBut perhaps we didn’t need to be. The replies were overwhelmingly kind; not a single person expressed so much as frustration, and, in fact, the community told us to take our time and not rush ourselves. The relief I felt upon seeing that was—indescribable.\n\nWith the pressure of immediately redeploying a fixed contract alleviated, Oizys and I turned our attention to the new contract. We now had an opportunity to improve it, not just push out the fixes for the two issues we had discovered.\n\nSo we had our order of business: patch the bugs, roll over the mints from the v1 contract, do a proper audit, make any additional improvements we wanted, and then redeploy.\n\nThe first problem we needed to fix was the giftWitches() function. Here was the original glitchy code:\n\nWe addressed the issue in two ways. First, we chose to remove the per-wallet check—it didn’t make sense to us that we would no longer be able to gift a WITCH to someone if they had already minted three on their own.\n\nJust removing the logic around the three-token limit eliminated this specific bug.\n\nBut the higher-level problem was how we were assigning token IDs—using totalSupply() made it unnecessarily fragile. Beyond that, Daniel McCartney (a skilled arcanist and friend upon whom we had called to review the code) observed that we were calling _safeMint() in five different places, calculating the correct token ID in each place. He suggested extracting the logic into a nextTokenId() method we could call instead.\n\nWe decided to switch to using OpenZeppelin’s Counters library and wrote a new nextTokenId() function (as used above) that would ensure that we would never be able to get stuck in a state where the next token ID pointed to an existing token again.\n\nThe next problem was the potential community sale exploit that Mersenne had flagged. The tweak for that was simple; instead of just requiring that msg.sender had fewer than three WITCHES in their wallet at the time, I added a mapping that tracked community sale mints by address and checked against that count.\n\n\"Max witches to mint in community sale is three\"\n\nWe needed a way to replicate the mints from the previous contract, which was straightforward enough. I wrote a function that took an array of addresses and minted them in order, along with a script that created and formatted the list by talking to the v1 contract.\n\n\"All witches are already rolled over\"\n\nAll of these mints would count toward the community mint counts. It wasn’t a perfect mapping because a handful of these WITCHES had been gifts, but we didn’t want to further complicate the logic by attempting to differentiate between the two.\n\nNow, the interesting bit. What could we do to improve the contract? With Mersenne, we suddenly had access to a depth of experience with Solidity. As we made changes to the contract, he reviewed them and suggested others. In the end, the v2 contract included five key improvements over v1.\n\nWe had made an effort to optimize for gas in v1 of the contract—but we didn’t realize that one choice we had made increased gas usage by ~30,000 per mint and per transfer. Nearly every single ERC-721 contract we read used ERC721Enumerable , the extension that supplied the totalSupply() function we had been using and, more importantly, maintained a mapping of which tokens belonged to a particular address.\n\nWe had added it without thinking too deeply about it; the value-add was ambiguous to us, but everyone else was using it, so we assumed it wouldn’t hurt to have the functionality. Without a clear mental model of what kinds of computations cost more or less gas, it didn’t occur to us that the data structures that the extension added could make the two key features of our contract (mints and transfers) as much as 50% more expensive.\n\nWith that knowledge, we decided to cut ERC721Enumerable in favor of off-chain implementations that didn’t require witches to pay a premium on every mint or transfer forever.\n\nIn writing the original contract, we considered reentrancy as an attack vector but incorrectly believed that our contract wasn’t susceptible because we weren’t calling arbitrary contracts. It turned out that we had missed a call inside OpenZeppelin’s implementation of _safeMint() —there was a function that did call a function on the receiver address if it was a contract. That meant that it was possible for contracts to call back into ours, sidestepping the checks we had put in place.\n\nBecause of that, we had to restructure how a few of our functions were written to update the state we were tracking in the contract before minting to ensure that they couldn’t be exploited with reentrancy.\n\nFor example, here was the original claim() function that allowed people to claim a WITCH for the cost of gas only:\n\n\"Witch already claimed by this wallet\"\n\nLogically, this code made sense—only once the mint was successful did we consider it claimed by the address and added to the total count of gifted WITCHES.\n\nBut because _safeMint() allowed reentrant calls back to the function, a malicious contract with a valid Merkle proof could keep calling back into claim() to mint more WITCHES, before we had been able to update our state.\n\nUpdating the state before performing actions like minting handled the issue.\n\n\"Witch already claimed by this wallet\"\n\nOn top of that, we opted to use OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard module, which offers a nonReentrant modifier that prevents reentrant calls to functions. We took care to add guards even to onlyOwner functions that only we could potentially exploit, as a measure to increase trust.\n\nAnd, speaking of modifiers, they were the next improvement that Mersenne offered. We hadn’t been familiar with the concept in Solidity, but I had felt the pain of our oft-duplicated require calls across our functions.\n\nFunction modifiers are a declarative way to “modify” functions, with code that runs before or after a function call. They’re typically used to wrap checks, both for readability and reusability.\n\nHere’s one example of how our mint() function changed. We started out with this code:\n\n\"Max witches already minted to this wallet\"\n\n\"Not enough witches remaining to mint\"\n\nNot the worst, but also not easy to parse at a glance. Especially since several of those require calls were the same ones we needed in other functions like mintCommunitySale() or giftWitches() , pulling them out into modifiers vastly improved the reading experience and made the code less error-prone.\n\nWith modifiers, the content of the mint() function became trivial—three lines of code, with an easy-to-understand list of modifiers that applied to it.\n\n\"Max witches to mint is three\"\n\n\"Not enough witches remaining to mint\"\n\nWe had a withdraw() function in v1 of the contract to withdraw the ETH from the mint, but Mersenne added a function to withdraw ERC-20 tokens as well, so that we were able to pull out any accidentally sent to our contract address.\n\nInitially I thought that it was nice to have this function, just in case, but also the odds weren’t super high that we’d need it. I was wrong! EIP-2981, the standard for on-chain royalties, explicitly does not specify a currency or token , and, in fact, some major marketplaces like LooksRare that have implemented on-chain royalties pay them in WETH, not ETH. Without this function, we wouldn’t have been able to withdraw these royalties; they would be trapped in the contract forever.\n\nFinally, as we wrapped work on the contract and readied for redeployment, Mersenne noted that the OpenSea proxy registry approval we had enabled for gasless listings could be a vulnerability for the contract, in the event that OpenSea were ever compromised. If we thought there was a chance that Crypto Coven could become a truly long-term project, it would be wise to add a toggle that allowed us to disable access.\n\nIt was a helpful reminder that, in a world of code as long-lived (and an environment as adversarial) as Ethereum, it can be important to take the long view. Companies come and go; the blockchain is forever.\n\nAt last, on November 3, we were ready to redeploy. The whole process, as long and arduous as it had felt, had taken just two days.\n\nI deployed the v2 contract , ran the script to generate the most up-to-date list of current owners of tokens from the v1 contract, and called the rollover function. Just like that, minting could resume. The next day, we updated the base URI for the original contract, replacing the WITCHES with the soul vessels. The transition was complete.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the state of the project would transform utterly. The coven would start to grow—slowly at first, and then all at once. Soon, countless people we admired, in and out of web3, would start to assume the visage of a WITCH. The first sprouts of conceptual expansions of our world would start to emerge out of the community. And, underneath it all, the contract (its own subject of no little praise ) hummed, surely and steadily, holding the coven fast.\n\nI close this imparting of learnings with perhaps the most important one of all: no smart contract is perfect. The same is true for ours. The Crypto Coven contract that now lives on mainnet contains two known bugs, one of which spelled the return of the void witch. Both are detailed in this earlier post , and fortunately neither was severe enough that we had to take more drastic action again.\n\nEven outside of these flaws, with the knowledge we’ve accrued since this first attempt at conjuring artifacts out of the ether, there are further refinements I’d make—for better on-chain composability, for even lower gas usage, for less fragile batch reveals, and so on. This domain is still just emerging; day by day, week by week, the collective wisdom evolves in novel and intriguing directions.\n\nAnd, finally: writing immutable code that deals in large sums of coin is emotionally taxing. The sob emoji became the most frequently used on my keyboard; I’ve cursed the very existence of smart contracts more times than I can remember.\n\nBut, more earnestly, it is good to face shipping Solidity with apprehension. That’s how it should be. It’s not a responsibility to take lightly. Doing high-stakes work has high-stakes consequences, and once the die is cast, it cannot be undone. The choices you make, knowingly or unknowingly, have gravity.\n\nThere will be errors, because code is code, and constructing an incantation to perfectly mirror your wishes requires more than just caution or care. But, as arcanists, the most we can endeavor to do is our finest work—and no less.\n\nmapping ( address =\u003e uint256 ) public communityMintCounts ; function mintCommunitySale ( uint8 numberOfTokens

#36: Welcome Web3 Dining - Snaxshot","link":"https://snaxshot.substack.com/p/snaxshot-36-welcome-web3-dining?s=r","content":"A newsletter on upcoming food and beverage trends that offers a curation of brands and aesthetics written by Andrea Hernández.\n\nAs a 90s kid myself, I’ve been seeing web3 commentary that is inherently just recycled web1, buying internet assets or being part of digital communities isn’t novel for a generation who had webrings and Neopets. The same reason why I think “drop culture” is so predominant in genZ is for lack of web1 friction that millennials grew up with, remember buffering? And wanting to create that friction growing up with instant gratification as default, more on this on another day, I promise.\n\nBack to Neopets comparison, these collection drops are so reminiscent of omelettes you could obtain for free in Tyrannia, they even had “rarity” like when you received a dinosaur egg omelette. Of course there are major differences and the fact that we are fully grown adults now, though 12 year olds are trading NFTs alike, web3 is shaping up to be what web1 always intended for at the dawn of the internet, collective wealth , connectivity and community.\n\nThis isn’t the first time we mention NFTs at Snaxshot, and it won’t be the last, it’s essential to our predictions of Food in 2025 . For those just joining us and wondering WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?! Let’s catch you up:\n\nNFT —non fungible token, a unique, non interchangeable data point, stored on a blockchain. They represent “certificate of ownership” and can take many forms.\n\nBlockchain —a ledger, blocks linked together using cryptography. This is also why it’s called “crypto.” Know that there are different “chains” like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, etc\n\nweb3 —a very broad term but it’s commonly used to reference a more “decentralized” internet\n\nAs we are talking about a major shift happening, the coming of web3 is already being heralded and even welcomed in the food space. NFTs becoming building blocks that offer an array of endless possibilities, and since we last wrote about them, some interesting concepts have emerged. Care to explore them with me? Buckle up, fuck the metaverse, Zuckerberg already owns the IP to that, around here we call it snaxverse, hop on your favorite chain and let’s get moving.\n\n—Food \u0026 beverages ecommerce is expected to grew from $25 billion in 2020 to $31 billion in 2021!\n\n—NFT sales volume surged to $10.7 billion in Q3 2021, up more than 8x from the previous quarter\n\n—In the second quarter of 2021, gaming company Roblox Corporation generated total revenues of over $454 million.\n\n— Sky Mavis and its players have generated $2.05 billion in sales to date for Axie Infinity, an (NFT) game, according to measurement firm DappRadar\n\n—DAOs are absorbing the internet , tens of billions are being managed across top DAOs, with some, like Compound , boasting a treasury of almost $1 billion itself.\n\nAfter spending 1.5 years indoors, the world saw the resurgence of the supper/dinner club, Bettina Makalintal from Bon Appetit wrote about this recently , we all want to dine out and dine together. The Economist beautifully broke down where this craving of a dining experience comes from, hint: it’s inherent human nature as much as animals feed together at watering holes. This is tale as old as time meets a new kind of mechanism, enter Dinner Dao, breaking bread with internet friends, artist Austin Robey conceived the idea in New York, following similar DAO guidelines, this is how DD works:\n\nUnlock NFT allows for gated access to the Dinner DAO’s private Discord channels\n\nFor the meal itself, and almost ironically, a member pays via a card (fiat) and is reimbursed through DAO treasury (though this might evolve as more restaurant get into accepting crypto)\n\nFor context, this checks the boxes of why one would want to start a DAO in the first place:\n\nThe NYC chapter was the first iteration, they all had dinner at Shoo Shoo Nolita. Portland is the next chapter and is already a sold out experience. Dinner Dao wants to expand to cities around the world, and to be fair their inherent utility at the moment is making large group payments easier than splitting the bill, for real though, why hasn’t anyone come up with this mechanism a la Uber?! In all seriousness, what differentiates this from any web2 version of it out there, is the ability to give stake and equity to your community, participation is the new signaling.\n\nWhere does this go from here? Dinner Dao is a very simple example of what can be done using a decentralized mechanism, here are some communities I believe are primed to go web3:\n\nAlimentari Flaneur — which is basically transporting you to a European dinner at every one of their events, and imagine them self funding these not through “catered affairs” but community support, can imagine them leveraging their NYC fandom to bring AF aesthetics and delectables across boroughs.\n\nHer Name is Nala —also based in NYC, a supper club that curates community, aesthetics and cuisine to create delightful dining experiences, this mechanism could allow them to expand this concept further.\n\nMinimun Wines —Based in Australia, a vineyard that has built a community that involves poetry submissions and monthly zines, as well as wine subscriptions, it would be wonderful to see them use web3 to open up their community (ethical vineyards) and invite folks from all around the world.\n\nAnother concept that has emerged out of web3 dynamics is NFT to eatery, take for example, Breakfast World, which has started as a collection of 6969 breakfast sandwich NFTs and has highlighted on their roadmap they aim to open physical locations, though in all honesty it’s something that can be easily spun up as a popup instead. Will the next Waffle House or IHOP come out of similar projects? Only time will tell, in the meantime this is a good way to crowdsource IMO, food concepts that are supported via community.\n\nEarlier this year Pizza Dao sold thousands of pizza NFTs from over 300 artists and netted roughly $1.5 million in the span of two months! The plan was to give 1 million slices in honor of Bitcoin Pizza day, in the US they partnered with SLICE to deliver 2,500 pizzas across the nation. Can someone confirm if this has been essentially the largest pizza party ever hosted?!\n\nCommunities like Fast Food Punks whose NFTs that are a mesh between Cryptopunks and fast food chains have sold for thousands of dollars, could also easily partner with the chains they are spinning up their NFTs around, imagine that holding FFP gave you access to a secret menu at any IRL Burger King, Wendy’s or McDonald’s these behemoth chains could benefit from the creativity and community sentiment form around this NFTs that could transcend into their eateries.\n\nWhat does ordering food look like in a virtual world? From virtual food trucks that actually order delivery for you to opening your own restaurant inside the snaxverse, here are some present examples of what this looks like.\n\nLast year we got a preview of what food ordering inside the snaxverse would look like, thanks to Complex, they hosted the now prophetic Complexland, pioneering how fashion, art, music, shopping and eating can look like virtually, emulating IRL scenarios.\n\nOnce inside ComplexLand, there were food trucks from spots like Uncle Paulie’s Deli, Artichoke Pizza, Teranga, and Sweet Chick parked throughout the different neighborhoods. You could open a delivery menu at each truck and check out which IRL cities they were serving, and, if you found something in your area, you could literally order a meal, straight from your avatar to your door.\n\nOrdering inside the snaxverse is becoming mainstream through partnerships like Chipotle and Roblox, the campaign was such a hit, it literally broke Roblox for 3 days straight ( though they deny it had anything to do with it ) —hello, offering $1 million in free burritos is going to spike traffic regardless of what “verse” you’re in. The Chipotle in Roblox was similar to it’s IRL countertpart, they even adopted their employee to fit Roblox aesthetics, it also involved completing a maze to be able to redeem the free #boorito.\n\nChipotle just paved the way for more mainstream food chains to go on chain (lol, someone please take my computer away from me) by serving as example of meeting folks in their medium natively, in a way that works so well, you too may break the snaxverse. This also presents a new dimension for URL to IRL promotions, that feel less extractive like an Instagram ad, and more natively and rewarding consumers for a behavior they actually enjoy, ie gaming.\n\nGary Vee is launching the first NFT restaurant , even though a lot of people felt it was “cringe” the concept isn’t novel, member only restaurants exist, this concept just switches up membership via an NFT. The NFT represents ownership of membership, it will provide access to the restaurant throughout the month, in addition to unlimited enjoyment of the cocktail lounge and access to private culinary experiences. There will be 3 different NFT Tokens representing a multitude of experiences in the restaurant. Each NFT is an asset and can be sold or transferred in the secondary market, something that currently doesn’t exist and isn’t allowed in web2 dynamics.\n\nWhere does this go from here? Here are some examples of concepts that would do well in this dynamic:\n\nPlanque: A wine clubhouse based in the UK, it’s a beautiful space and access to it requires a membership. It’s become a trendy hotspot, imagine being able to sell your membership at a place that’s become increasingly valuable? Talk about ROI, and I can even imagine being an OG member coming along with added perks (making it more rare and encouraging the initial investment)\n\nPoolsuite: They are soon introducing their vision of web3, but no one seems more primed to becoming a desirable members only lounge than this community. Can imagine cabana access, unlimited tiki cocktails not just through their own iterations, but imagine having Poolsuite lounges at the airport?!\n\nIt’s 2021 and Burger King has recently partnered with Robinhood to give out crypto to customers, yes you read this right. Regardless of what you may think of this, the idea of getting crypto into the hands of mainstream folk is amazing as it removes friction of obtaining it in the first place, and this comes in handy when you’re trying to “crypto pill” folks in the first place.\n\nThis also represents a future where “crypto” becomes norm, considering entire countries are adapting it and actually encouraging its use, think El Salvador, where even the street vendors are using Bitcoin in a region where so many folks are unbanked because of the exhaustive and bureaucratic process that entails, hence the rise of fintech. Crypto even fixes the friction some fintech apps come along with, example Stripe, Square, Venmo and CashApp not being available in majority of places outside of UK/US. This is also a way for their NFT marketing initiatives to take off more mainstream, making it easier for folks to be able to “ape” into them because they’ve got some ETH to spend, and who knows, could be good for the floor prices of these fast food collections overall.\n\nThis week, American celebrity chef, Rocco Dispirito is launching a recipe NFT , as a way to commemorate an NFT festival taking place in New York this week. What is it specifically? The NFT will be unveiled during NFT.NYC , along with the company Metaversal , this recipe will be paired with “The Fractals of Taste” by Dustin Chan, a loopable 5-min video that complements the flavors and reflects colors referenced in DiSpirito’s first cookbook.\n\nNot just for celebrity chefs, and as previously mentioned in Food in 2025, web3 allows for a different way of publishing, not just recipes, but cookbooks, that empower their creators in ways that could not be done before, consider that you still earn % of sale in perpetuity, regardless of how many times an NFT is sold. A great platform that serves as an example of this is Mirror , where not only can one think of crowdsourcing their new book, but consider that even now media companies are being born through it.\n\nIMO, legacy restaurants should also leverage this, imagine if you could be owner of the OG sazerac recipe from The Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans, that not only is a signaler but also something that could accrue value, or the seasoning recipe that makes Popeye’s cajun fries so addictive, please for fuck sake, stop making cards of your food and making that an NFT , no one gives a shit, truly, what’s the fucking utility of that and how does that garner any value over time?! Looking at you McRib .\n\nWhat if NFTs could provide x-amount of reservations to your favorite place, to be “burned” or redemeed throughout a certain period of time? Not to mention having the ability to “cash in” on having reservations at a trendy place that you no longer can make, those are the promises of web3 dynamics, maybe if Patrick Bateman could have bought Paul Allen’s Dorsia reservation for 8:30PM, he wouldn’t have ended up a psychotic killer, think of the possibilities!\n\nFWB is a good example of how this dynamic looks like, they threw an event last night where you could purchase an NFT, “Proof of Raver” it sold for 11 ETH or almost $50,000, all going towards the venue they partnered with, imagine what this means for the future of events. The NFT came with its own perks, including 5+ guests, 12 drink tickets and of course, the collectible of a one-of-a-kind event.\n\nSnaxshot is headed to Los Angeles again!

Such comments imply that time is “fungible” — that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent writing a novel. And sadly, that’s just not the case.\n\nTime has various levels of quality. If I’m walking to the subway station and I’ve forgotten my notebook, then it’s pretty hard for me to write more than a couple paragraphs. And it’s tough to focus when you keep getting interrupted. There’s also a mental component: sometimes I feel happy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I feel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.\n\nIf you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact and deal with it. First, you have to make the best of each kind of time. And second, you have to try to make your time higher-quality.\n\nLife is short (or so I’m told) so why waste it doing something dumb? It’s easy to start working on something because it’s convenient, but you should always be questioning yourself about it. Is there something more important you can work on? Why don’t you do that instead? Such questions are hard to face up to (eventually, if you follow this rule, you’ll have to ask yourself why you’re not working on the most important problem in the world) but each little step makes you more productive.\n\nThis isn’t to say that all your time should be spent on the most important problem in the world. Mine certainly isn’t (after all, I’m writing this essay). But it’s definitely the standard against which I measure my life.\n\nAnother common myth is that you’ll get more done if you pick one problem and focus on it exclusively. I find this is hardly ever true. Just this moment for example, I’m trying to fix my posture, exercise some muscles, drink some fluids, clean off my desk, IM with my brother, and write this essay. Over the course the day, I’ve worked on this essay, read a book, had some food, answered some email, chatted with friends, done some shopping, worked on a couple other essays, backed up my hard drive, and organized my book list. In the past week I’ve worked on several different software projects, read several different books, studied a couple different programming languages, moved some of my stuff, and so on.\n\nHaving a lot of different projects gives you work for different qualities of time. Plus, you’ll have other things to work on if you get stuck or bored (and that can give your mind time to unstick yourself).\n\nIt also makes you more creative. Creativity comes from applying things you learn in other fields to the field you work in. If you have a bunch of different projects going in different fields, then you have many more ideas you can apply.\n\nComing up with a bunch of different things to work on shouldn’t be hard — most people have tons of stuff they want to get done. But if you try to keep it all in your head it quickly gets overwhelming. The psychic pressure of having to remember all of it can make you crazy. The solution is again simple: write it down.\n\nOnce you have a list of all the things you want to do, you can organize it by kind. For example, my list is programming, writing, thinking, errands, reading, listening, and watching (in that order).\n\nMost major projects involve a bunch of these different tasks. Writing this, for example, involves reading about other procrastination systems, thinking up new sections of the article, cleaning up sentences, emailing people with questions, and so on, all in addition to the actual work of writing the text. Each task can go under the appropriate section, so that you can do it when you have the right kind of time.\n\nOnce you have this list, the problem becomes remembering to look at it. And the best way to remember to look at it is to make looking at it what you would do anyway. For example, I keep a stack of books on my desk, with the ones I’m currently reading on top. When I need a book to read, I just grab the top one off the stack.\n\nI do the same thing with TV/movies. Whenever I hear about a movie I should watch, I put it in a special folder on my computer. Now whenever I feel like watching TV, I just open up that folder.\n\nI’ve also thought about some more intrusive ways of doing this. For example, a web page that pops up with a list of articles in my “to read” folder whenever I try to check some weblogs. Or maybe even a window that pops up with work suggestions occasionally for me to see when I’m goofing off.\n\nMaking the best use of the time you have can only get you so far. The much more important problem is making more higher quality time for yourself. Most people’s time is eaten up by things like school and work. Obviously if you attend one of these, you should stop. But what else can you do?\n\nPretty much everyone interesting I know has some sort of pocket notebook they carry at all times. Pen and paper is immediately useful in all kinds of circumstances — if you need to write something down for somebody, take notes on something, scratch down an idea, and so on. I’ve even written whole articles in the subway. 1\n\n(I used to do this, but now I just carry my computerphone everywhere. It doesn’t let me give people information physically, but it makes up for it by giving me something to read all the time (email) and pushing my notes straight into my email inbox, where I’m forced to deal with them right away.)\n\nFor tasks that require serious focus, you should avoid getting interrupted. One simple way is to go somewhere interrupters can’t find you. Another is to set up an agreement with the people around you: “don’t bother me when the door is closed” or “IM me if I have headphones on” (and then you can ignore the IMs until you’re free).\n\nYou don’t want to overdo it. Sometimes if you’re really wasting time you should be distracted. It’s a much better use of time to help someone else with their problem than it is to sit and read the news. That’s why setting up specific agreements is a good idea: you can be interrupted when you’re not really focusing.\n\nTime when you’re hungry or tired or twitchy is low-quality time. Improving it is simple: eat, sleep, and exercise. Yet I somehow manage to screw up even this. I don’t like going to get food, so I’ll often work right through being hungry and end up so tired out that I can’t bring myself to go get food. 2\n\nIt’s tempting to say to yourself, “I know I’m tired but I can’t take a nap — I have work to do”. In fact, you’ll be much more productive if you do take that nap, since you’ll improve the quality of the day’s remaining time and you were going to have to sleep sometime anyway.\n\nI don’t really exercise much so I’m probably not the best person to give advice on that bit, but I do try to work it in where I can. While I’m lying down reading, I do situps. And when I need to go somewhere on foot, I run.\n\nEasing mental constraints is much harder. One thing that helps is having friends who are cheerful. For example, I always find myself much more inclined to work after talking to Paul Graham or Dan Connolly — they just radiate energy. It’s tempting to think that you need to get away from people and shut yourself off in your room to do any real work, but this can be so demoralizing that it’s actually less efficient.\n\nEven if your friends aren’t cheerful, just working on a hard problem with someone else makes it much easier. For one thing, the mental weight gets spread across both people. For another, having someone else there forces you to work instead of getting distracted.\n\nBut all of this is sort of dodging the issue. The real productivity problem people have is procrastination. It’s something of a dirty little secret, but everyone procrastinates — severely. It’s not just you. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to stop it.\n\nWhat is procrastination? To the outside observer, it looks like you’re just doing something “fun” (like playing a game or reading the news) instead of doing your actual work. (This usually causes the outside observer to think you’re lazy and bad.) But the real question is: what’s going on inside your head?\n\nI’ve spent a bunch of time trying to explore this and the best way I can describe it is that your brain puts up a sort of mental force field around a task. Ever play with two magnets? If you orient the magnets properly and try to push them towards each other, they’ll repel fiercely. As you move them around, you can sort of feel out the edges of the magnetic field. And as you try to bring the magnets together, the field will push you back or off in another direction.\n\nThe mental block seems to work in the same way. It’s not particularly solid or visible, but you can sort of feel it around the edges. And the more you try to go towards it the more it pushes you away. And so, not surprisingly, you end up going in another direction. 3\n\nAnd just as you can’t get two repelling magnets to sit together just by pushing real hard — they’ll fling back as soon as you stop pushing — I’ve never been able to overcome this mental force field through sheer willpower. Instead, you have to be sneaky about it — you have to rotate a magnet.\n\nSo what causes the mental force field? There appear to be two major factors: whether the task is hard and whether it’s assigned.\n\nThe first kind of hard problem is the problem that’s too big. Say you want to build a recipe organizing program. Nobody can really just sit down and build a recipe organizer. That’s a goal, not a task. A task is a specific concrete step you can take towards your goal. A good first task might be something like “draw a mockup of the screen that displays a recipe”. Now that’s something you can do. 4\n\nAnd when you do that, the next steps become clearer. You have to decide what a recipe consists of, what kind of search features are needed, how to structure the recipe database, and so on. You build up a momentum, each task leading to the next. And as your brain gets crunching on the subject, it becomes easier to solve that subject’s problems.\n\nFor each of my big projects, I think of all the tasks I can do next for them and add them to my categorized todo list (see above). And when I stop working on something, I add its next possible tasks to the todo list.\n\nAnother kind of hard problem is the one that’s too complicated or audacious. Writing a book seems daunting, so start by doing an essay. If an essay is too much, start by writing a paragraph summary. The important thing is to have something done right away.\n\nOnce you have something, you can judge it more accurately and understand the problem better. It’s also much easier to improve something that already exists than to work at a blank page. If your paragraph goes well, then maybe it can grow into an essay and then into a book, little by little, a perfectly reasonable piece of writing all the way through..\n\nOften the key to solving a hard problem will be getting some piece of inspiration. If you don’t know much about the field, you should obviously start by researching it — see how other people did things, get a sense of the terrain. Sit and try and understand the field fully. Do some smaller problems to see if you have a handle on it.\n\nAssigned problems are problems you’re told to work on. Numerous psychology experiments have found that when you try to “incentivize” people to do something, they’re less likely to do it and do a worse job. External incentives, like rewards and punishments, kills what psychologists call your “intrinsic motivation” — your natural interest in the problem. (This is one of the most thoroughly replicated findings of social psychology — over 70 studies have found that rewards undermine interest in the task.) 5 People’s heads seem to have a deep avoidance of being told what to do. 6\n\nThe weird thing is that this phenomenon isn’t just limited to other people — it even happens when you try to tell yourself what to do! If you say to yourself, “I should really work on X, that’s the most important thing to do right now” then all of the sudden X becomes the toughest thing in the world to make yourself work on. But as soon as Y becomes the most important thing, the exact same X becomes much easier.\n\nThis presents a rather obvious solution: if you want to work on X, tell yourself to do Y. Unfortunately, it’s sort of difficult to trick yourself intentionally, because you know you’re doing it. 7 So you’ve got to be sneaky about it.\n\nOne way is to get someone else to assign something to you. The most famous instance of this is grad students who are required to write a dissertation, a monumentally difficult task that they need to do to graduate. And so, to avoid doing this, grad students end up doing all sorts of other hard stuff.\n\nThe task has to both seem important (you have to do this to graduate!) and big (hundreds of pages of your best work!) but not actually be so important that putting it off is going to be a disaster.\n\nIt’s very tempting to say “alright, I need to put all this aside, hunker down and finish this essay”. Even worse is to try to bribe yourself into doing something, like saying “alright, if I just finish this essay then I’ll go and eat some candy”. But the absolute worst of all is to get someone else to try to force you to do something.\n\nAll of these are very tempting — I’ve done them all myself — but they’re completely counterproductive. In all three cases, you’ve basically assigned yourself a task. Now your brain is going to do everything it can to escape it.\n\nHard work isn’t supposed to be pleasant, we’re told. But in fact it’s probably the most enjoyable thing I do. Not only does a tough problem completely absorb you while you’re trying to solve it, but afterwards you feel wonderful having accomplished something so serious.\n\nSo the secret to getting yourself to do something is not to convince yourself you have to do it, but to convince yourself that it’s fun. And if it isn’t, then you need to make it fun.\n\nI first got serious about this when I had to write essays for college. Writing essays isn’t a particularly hard task, but it sure is assigned. Who would voluntarily write a couple pages connecting the observations of two random books? So I started making the essays into my own little jokes. For one, I decided to write each paragraph in its own little style, trying my best to imitate various forms of speech. (This had the added benefit of padding things out.) 8\n\nAnother way to make things more fun is to solve the meta-problem. Instead of building a web application, try building a web application framework with this as the example app. Not only will the task be more enjoyable, but the result will probably be more useful.\n\nThere are a lot of myths about productivity — that time is fungible, that focusing is good, that bribing yourself is effective, that hard work is unpleasant, that procrastinating is unnatural — but they all have a common theme: a conception of real work as something that goes against your natural inclinations.\n\nAnd for most people, in most jobs, this may be the case. There’s no reason you should be inclined to write boring essays or file pointless memos. And if society is going to force you to do so anyway, then you need to learn to shut out the voices in your head telling you to stop.\n\nBut if you’re trying to do something worthwhile and creative, then shutting down your brain is entirely the wrong way to go. The real secret to productivity is the reverse: to listen to your body. To eat when you’re hungry, to sleep when you’re tired, to take a break when you’re bored, to work on projects that seem fun and interesting.\n\nIt seems all too simple. It doesn’t involve any fancy acronyms or self-determination or personal testimonials from successful businessmen. It almost seems like common sense. But society’s conception of work has pushed us in the opposite direction. If we want to be more productive, all we need to do is turn around.\n\nIf you want to learn more about the pscyhology of motivation, there is nothing better than Alfie Kohn . He’s written many articles on the subject and an entire book, Punished by Rewards , which I highly recommend.\n\nI hope to address how to quit school in a future essay, but you should really just go out and pick up The Teenage Liberation Handbook . If you’re a computer person, one way to quit your job is by applying for funding from Y Combinator . Meanwhile, Mickey Z’s book The Murdering of My Years features artists and activists describing how they manage to make ends meet while still doing what they want.\n\nYou should follow me on twitter

Thank you :)\n\nThe most important realization I got from psychedelics was the understanding that everything was okay. I felt a deep rightness in the world that was separate from yet connected to me. It made all my problems less important. Suddenly it seemed insane to hinge my happiness or self-worth on if I was accomplished enough, hot enough, whether or not a boy loved me back. I saw myself the way you see a plant: you notice that it’s growing on its own, reaching towards the sun. You water it, but you understand that you don’t need to worry about it too much. You’re never like is the plant a Good Plant or Bad Plant? You’re just like, is it healthy? I want it to be healthy.\n\nIt was a deeply useful insight, but it didn’t change me overnight. I still had these entrenched patterns of behavior that I’d been recreating since I was a little kid. I’ll give you some examples: I’ve always been scared of abandonment and rejection, I never felt safe, and I wanted very deeply to be loved. These were traits that were present in me as a 4-year-old. They’ve always been part of how I’ve approached school, work, and relationships. They thrummed around me like white noise when I was trying to sit in silence. I was intellectually aware of them on some level, but they were so painful and primordial that I struggled to really touch them. For example, I would notice that I often felt fidgety or anxious when I was alone. That was because I always relied on other people to reflect “okayness” back to me—I looked to the external world for reassurance. I didn’t really know whether I was okay or not when I had no input from others. But I didn’t know how to change that—I didn’t know how to stop feeling the way I was feeling. My discomfort was a living being crushing me under its weight.\n\nNow I realize that I needed distance. I needed the ability to look at myself without judgment, to watch myself the way I would watch someone else. Distance is the only way we can have real perspective. And that’s what psychedelics and mindfulness gave me: the ability to maintain distance. For the past two years I’ve been watching myself the way you might watch a movie. I notice which things upset me, and the coping mechanisms I turn to when I’m upset. I notice that when I’m stressed it feels like a ball of tension is expanding in my chest. I notice that for my whole life I’ve been driven by anxiety, driven by competitiveness, driven by the need to feel chosen. I notice the unrealistic expectations I have for love: the way I use it as a pacifier, the way I believe that it can solve any problem. But it could never solve my most important problem.\n\nWhat I need, now and forever, is to be the person who loves and cares for myself most reliably. I’ve always known that my parents love me, my friends love me. But I also knew that I was the only one who understood myself fully—I was the only person who knew my own dreams, secrets, failings, all the dark spots and all the cracks of light. I should’ve been the one who took care of myself. Who watched all the moments when I was brave, scared, cruel and kind, gave feedback gently, believed in myself unconditionally. For so long I wasn’t able to do that. I couldn’t self-soothe.\n\nBut now I can, or at least I’m starting to. I can see the hunger yawn and tell myself it’s okay. I can stay with moments of distress knowing that they will pass. I can lie awake in bed alone at night and feel nothing but a warm buzz of contentment. I’ve realized that I don’t have to consciously try to get better, I don’t need to be perfect. I can just be in the moment, this particular moment of not knowing, swimming in my not-knowing, swimming in my imperfection, and it feels… good?\n\nIt’s crazy to realize how deep these knots are. I was all tied up inside before I could pronounce “insecure attachment,” lol. That’s how it is for most of us, I think. We are created by our parents and culture, shaped by forces beyond our control before we’re fully conscious. And then we spend the rest of our lives trying to get free. It’s deep work trying to undo the knots—the deepest work. But it’s also pretty much the only work that matters.\n\nIt’s why I write this Substack: I wanted to interrogate myself, in the hope that I could accept myself. I wanted to love myself for being just who I was. Because I thought that if I could do that I could see other people more clearly, I could see the world clearly. I could have a field of vision that wasn’t blurred and distorted by my need for validation. I could love the light for being the light. I could examine every moment of my life the way you examine the body of someone you love. Knowing that it is perfect without qualifications, that the beauty can never be marred. Because the love is there and it spills out of everything.\n\nP.S. I’ve been experimenting with an advice column.

This isn’t especially original to me and I don’t claim anything more than to be explaining and rewording things I have heard from a bunch of other people. Unapologetically America-centric because I’m not informed enough to make it otherwise. Try to keep this off Reddit and other similar sorts of things.]\n\nI.\n\nIn Chesterton’s The Secret of Father Brown , a beloved nobleman who murdered his good-for-nothing brother in a duel thirty years ago returns to his hometown wracked by guilt. All the townspeople want to forgive him immediately, and they mock the titular priest for only being willing to give a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection. They lecture the priest on the virtues of charity and compassion.\n\nLater, it comes out that the beloved nobleman did not in fact kill his good-for-nothing brother. The good-for-nothing brother killed the beloved nobleman (and stole his identity). Now the townspeople want to see him lynched or burned alive, and it is only the priest who – consistently – offers a measured forgiveness conditional on penance and self-reflection.\n\nIt seems to me that you only pardon the sins that you don’t really think sinful. You only forgive criminals when they commit what you don’t regard as crimes, but rather as conventions. You forgive a conventional duel just as you forgive a conventional divorce. You forgive because there isn’t anything to be forgiven.\n\nHe further notes that this is why the townspeople can self-righteously consider themselves more compassionate and forgiving than he is. Actual forgiveness, the kind the priest needs to cultivate to forgive evildoers, is really really hard. The fake forgiveness the townspeople use to forgive the people they like is really easy, so they get to boast not only of their forgiving nature, but of how much nicer they are than those mean old priests who find forgiveness difficult and want penance along with it.\n\nAfter some thought I agree with Chesterton’s point. There are a lot of people who say “I forgive you” when they mean “No harm done”, and a lot of people who say “That was unforgiveable” when they mean “That was genuinely really bad”. Whether or not forgiveness is right is a complicated topic I do not want to get in here. But since forgiveness is generally considered a virtue, and one that many want credit for having, I think it’s fair to say you only earn the right to call yourself ‘forgiving’ if you forgive things that genuinely hurt you.\n\nTo borrow Chesterton’s example, if you think divorce is a-ok, then you don’t get to “forgive” people their divorces, you merely ignore them. Someone who thinks divorce is abhorrent can “forgive” divorce. You can forgive theft, or murder, or tax evasion, or something you find abhorrent.\n\nI mean, from a utilitarian point of view, you are still doing the correct action of not giving people grief because they’re a divorcee. You can have all the Utility Points you want. All I’m saying is that if you “forgive” something you don’t care about, you don’t earn any Virtue Points.\n\n(by way of illustration: a billionaire who gives $100 to charity gets as many Utility Points as an impoverished pensioner who donates the same amount, but the latter gets a lot more Virtue Points)\n\nTolerance is also considered a virtue, but it suffers the same sort of dimished expectations forgiveness does.\n\nThe Emperor summons before him Bodhidharma and asks: “Master, I have been tolerant of innumerable gays, lesbians, bisexuals, asexuals, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, transgender people, and Jews. How many Virtue Points have I earned for my meritorious deeds?”\n\nThe Emperor, somewhat put out, demands to know why.\n\nBodhidharma asks: “Well, what do you think of gay people?”\n\nThe Emperor answers: “What do you think I am, some kind of homophobic bigot? Of course I have nothing against gay people!”\n\nAnd Bodhidharma answers: “Thus do you gain no merit by tolerating them!”\n\nII.\n\nIf I had to define “tolerance” it would be something like “respect and kindness toward members of an outgroup”.\n\nAnd today we have an almost unprecedented situation.\n\nWe have a lot of people – like the Emperor – boasting of being able to tolerate everyone from every outgroup they can imagine, loving the outgroup, writing long paeans to how great the outgroup is, staying up at night fretting that somebody else might not like the outgroup enough.\n\nThis is really surprising. It’s a total reversal of everything we know about human psychology up to this point. No one did any genetic engineering. No one passed out weird glowing pills in the public schools. And yet suddenly we get an entire group of people who conspicuously promote and defend their outgroups, the outer the better.\n\nWhat is going on here?\n\nLet’s start by asking what exactly an outgroup is.\n\nThere’s a very boring sense in which, assuming the Emperor’s straight, gays are part of his “outgroup” ie a group that he is not a member of. But if the Emperor has curly hair, are straight-haired people part of his outgroup? If the Emperor’s name starts with the letter ‘A’, are people whose names start with the letter ‘B’ part of his outgroup?\n\nNah. I would differentiate between multiple different meanings of outgroup, where one is “a group you are not a part of” and the other is…something stronger.\n\nI want to avoid a very easy trap, which is saying that outgroups are about how different you are, or how hostile you are. I don’t think that’s quite right.\n\nCompare the Nazis to the German Jews and to the Japanese. The Nazis were very similar to the German Jews: they looked the same, spoke the same language, came from a similar culture. The Nazis were totally different from the Japanese: different race, different language, vast cultural gap. But the Nazis and Japanese mostly got along pretty well. Heck, the Nazis were actually moderately positively disposed to the Chinese , even when they were technically at war. Meanwhile, the conflict between the Nazis and the German Jews – some of whom didn’t even realize they were anything other than German until they checked their grandparents’ birth certificate – is the stuff of history and nightmares. Any theory of outgroupishness that naively assumes the Nazis’ natural outgroup is Japanese or Chinese people will be totally inadequate.\n\nAnd this isn’t a weird exception. Freud spoke of the narcissism of small differences , saying that “it is precisely communities with adjoining territories, and related to each other in other ways as well, who are engaged in constant feuds and ridiculing each other”. Nazis and German Jews. Northern Irish Protestants and Northern Irish Catholics. Hutus and Tutsis. South African whites and South African blacks. Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Anyone in the former Yugoslavia and anyone else in the former Yugoslavia.\n\nSo what makes an outgroup? Proximity plus small differences. If you want to know who someone in former Yugoslavia hates, don’t look at the Indonesians or the Zulus or the Tibetans or anyone else distant and exotic. Find the Yugoslavian ethnicity that lives closely intermingled with them and is most conspicuously similar to them, and chances are you’ll find the one who they have eight hundred years of seething hatred toward.\n\nWhat makes an unexpected in-group? The answer with Germans and Japanese is obvious – a strategic alliance. In fact, the World Wars forged a lot of unexpected temporary pseudo-friendships. A recent article from War Nerd points out that the British, after spending centuries subjugating and despising the Irish and Sikhs, suddenly needed Irish and Sikh soldiers for World Wars I and II respectively. “Crush them beneath our boots” quickly changed to fawning songs about how “there never was a coward where the shamrock grows” and endless paeans to Sikh military prowess.\n\nSure, scratch the paeans even a little bit and you find condescension as strong as ever. But eight hundred years of the British committing genocide against the Irish and considering them literally subhuman turned into smiles and songs about shamrocks once the Irish started looking like useful cannon fodder for a larger fight. And the Sikhs, dark-skinned people with turbans and beards who pretty much exemplify the European stereotype of “scary foreigner”, were lauded by everyone from the news media all the way up to Winston Churchill .\n\nIn other words, outgroups may be the people who look exactly like you, and scary foreigner types can become the in-group on a moment’s notice when it seems convenient.\n\nIII.\n\nThere are certain theories of dark matter where it barely interacts with the regular world at all , such that we could have a dark matter planet exactly co-incident with Earth and never know. Maybe dark matter people are walking all around us and through us, maybe my house is in the Times Square of a great dark matter city, maybe a few meters away from me a dark matter blogger is writing on his dark matter computer about how weird it would be if there was a light matter person he couldn’t see right next to him.\n\nThis is sort of how I feel about conservatives.\n\nI don’t mean the sort of light-matter conservatives who go around complaining about Big Government and occasionally voting for Romney. I see those guys all the time. What I mean is – well, take creationists. According to Gallup polls , about 46% of Americans are creationists. Not just in the sense of believing God helped guide evolution. I mean they think evolution is a vile atheist lie and God created humans exactly as they exist right now. That’s half the country.\n\nAnd I don’t have a single one of those people in my social circle. It’s not because I’m deliberately avoiding them; I’m pretty live-and-let-live politically, I wouldn’t ostracize someone just for some weird beliefs. And yet, even though I probably know about a hundred fifty people, I am pretty confident that not one of them is creationist. Odds of this happening by chance? 1/2^150 = 1/10^45 = approximately the chance of picking a particular atom if you are randomly selecting among all the atoms on Earth.\n\nAbout forty percent of Americans want to ban gay marriage. I think if I really stretch it, maybe ten of my top hundred fifty friends might fall into this group. This is less astronomically unlikely; the odds are a mere one to one hundred quintillion against.\n\nPeople like to talk about social bubbles, but that doesn’t even begin to cover one hundred quintillion. The only metaphor that seems really appropriate is the bizarre dark matter world.\n\nI live in a Republican congressional district in a state with a Republican governor. The conservatives are definitely out there. They drive on the same roads as I do, live in the same neighborhoods. But they might as well be made of dark matter. I never meet them.\n\nTo be fair, I spend a lot of my time inside on my computer. I’m browsing sites like Reddit.\n\nRecently, there was a thread on Reddit asking – Redditors Against Gay Marriage, What Is Your Best Supporting Argument? A Reddit user who didn’t understand how anybody could be against gay marriage honestly wanted to know how other people who were against it justified their position. He figured he might as well ask one of the largest sites on the Internet, with an estimated user base in the tens of millions.\n\nIt soon became clear that nobody there was actually against gay marriage.\n\nThere were a bunch of posts saying “I of course support gay marriage but here are some reasons some other people might be against it,” a bunch of others saying “my argument against gay marriage is the government shouldn’t be involved in the marriage business at all”, and several more saying “why would you even ask this question, there’s no possible good argument and you’re wasting your time”. About halfway through the thread someone started saying homosexuality was unnatural and I thought they were going to be the first one to actually answer the question, but at the end they added “But it’s not my place to decide what is or isn’t natural, I’m still pro-gay marriage.”\n\nIn a thread with 10,401 comments, a thread specifically asking for people against gay marriage, I was eventually able to find two people who came out and opposed it, way near the bottom. Their posts started with “I know I’m going to be downvoted to hell for this…”\n\nBut I’m not only on Reddit. I also hang out on LW.\n\nOn last year’s survey, I found that of American LWers who identify with one of the two major political parties, 80% are Democrat and 20% Republican, which actually sounds pretty balanced compared to some of these other examples.\n\nBut it doesn’t last. Pretty much all of those “Republicans” are libertarians who consider the GOP the lesser of two evils. When allowed to choose “libertarian” as an alternative, only 4% of visitors continued to identify as conservative. But that’s still…some. Right?\n\nWhen I broke the numbers down further, 3 percentage points of those are neoreactionaries, a bizarre sect that wants to be ruled by a king. Only one percent of LWers were normal everyday God-‘n-guns-but-not-George-III conservatives of the type that seem to make up about half of the United States.\n\nIt gets worse. My formative years were spent at a university which, if it was similar to other elite universities, had a faculty and a student body that skewed about 90-10 liberal to conservative – and we can bet that, like LW, even those few token conservatives are Mitt Romney types rather than God-n’-guns types. I get my news from vox.com, an Official Liberal Approved Site. Even when I go out to eat, it turns out my favorite restaurant, California Pizza Kitchen, is the most liberal restaurant in the United States .\n\nI inhabit the same geographical area as scores and scores of conservatives. But without meaning to, I have created an outrageously strong bubble, a 10^45 bubble. Conservatives are all around me, yet I am about as likely to have a serious encounter with one as I am a Tibetan lama.\n\n(Less likely, actually. One time a Tibetan lama came to my college and gave a really nice presentation, but if a conservative tried that, people would protest and it would be canceled.)\n\nIV.\n\nOne day I realized that entirely by accident I was fulfilling all the Jewish stereotypes.\n\nI’m nerdy, over-educated, good with words, good with money, weird sense of humor, don’t get outside much, I like deli sandwiches. And I’m a psychiatrist, which is about the most stereotypically Jewish profession short of maybe stand-up comedian or rabbi.\n\nI’m not very religious. And I don’t go to synagogue. But that’s stereotypically Jewish too!\n\nI bring this up because it would be a mistake to think “Well, a Jewish person is by definition someone who is born of a Jewish mother. Or I guess it sort of also means someone who follows the Mosaic Law and goes to synagogue. But I don’t care about Scott’s mother, and I know he doesn’t go to synagogue, so I can’t gain any useful information from knowing Scott is Jewish.”\n\nThe defining factors of Judaism – Torah-reading, synagogue-following, mother-having – are the tip of a giant iceberg. Jews sometimes identify as a “tribe”, and even if you don’t attend synagogue, you’re still a member of that tribe and people can still (in a statistical way) infer things about you by knowing your Jewish identity – like how likely they are to be psychiatrists.\n\nThe last section raised a question – if people rarely select their friends and associates and customers explicitly for politics, how do we end up with such intense political segregation?\n\nWell, in the same way “going to synagogue” is merely the iceberg-tip of a Jewish tribe with many distinguishing characteristics, so “voting Republican” or “identifying as conservative” or “believing in creationism” is the iceberg-tip of a conservative tribe with many distinguishing characteristics.\n\nA disproportionate number of my friends are Jewish, because I meet them at psychiatry conferences or something – we self-segregate not based on explicit religion but on implicit tribal characteristics. So in the same way, political tribes self-segregate to an impressive extent – a 1/10^45 extent, I will never tire of hammering in – based on their implicit tribal characteristics.\n\nThe people who are actually into this sort of thing sketch out a bunch of speculative tribes and subtribes, but to make it easier, let me stick with two and a half.\n\nThe Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting “USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!”, and listening to country music.\n\nThe Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to “everything except country”.\n\n(There is a partly-formed attempt to spin off a Grey Tribe typified by libertarian political beliefs, Dawkins-style atheism, vague annoyance that the question of gay rights even comes up, eating paleo, drinking Soylent, calling in rides on Uber, reading lots of blogs, calling American football “sportsball”, getting conspicuously upset about the War on Drugs and the NSA, and listening to filk – but for our current purposes this is a distraction and they can safely be considered part of the Blue Tribe most of the time)\n\nI think these “tribes” will turn out to be even stronger categories than politics. Harvard might skew 80-20 in terms of Democrats vs. Republicans, 90-10 in terms of liberals vs. conservatives, but maybe 99-1 in terms of Blues vs. Reds.\n\nIt’s the many, many differences between these tribes that explain the strength of the filter bubble – which have I mentioned segregates people at a strength of 1/10^45? Even in something as seemingly politically uncharged as going to California Pizza Kitchen or Sushi House for dinner, I’m restricting myself to the set of people who like cute artisanal pizzas or sophsticated foreign foods, which are classically Blue Tribe characteristics.\n\nAre these tribes based on geography? Are they based on race, ethnic origin, religion, IQ, what TV channels you watched as a kid? I don’t know.\n\nSome of it is certainly genetic – estimates of the genetic contribution to political association range from 0.4 to 0.6. Heritability of one’s attitudes toward gay rights range from 0.3 to 0.5, which hilariously is a little more heritable than homosexuality itself.\n\n(for an interesting attempt to break these down into more rigorous concepts like “traditionalism”, “authoritarianism”, and “in-group favoritism” and find the genetic loading for each see here . For an attempt to trace the specific genes involved, which mostly turn out to be NMDA receptors, see here )\n\nBut I don’t think it’s just genetics. There’s something else going on too. The word “class” seems like the closest analogue, but only if you use it in the sophisticated Paul Fussell Guide Through the American Status System way instead of the boring “another word for how much money you make” way.\n\nFor now we can just accept them as a brute fact – as multiple coexisting societies that might as well be made of dark matter for all of the interaction they have with one another – and move on.\n\nV.\n\nThe worst reaction I’ve ever gotten to a blog post was when I wrote about the death of Osama bin Laden. I’ve written all sorts of stuff about race and gender and politics and whatever, but that was the worst.\n\nI didn’t come out and say I was happy he was dead. But some people interpreted it that way, and there followed a bunch of comments and emails and Facebook messages about how could I possibly be happy about the death of another human being, even if he was a bad person? Everyone, even Osama, is a human being, and we should never rejoice in the death of a fellow man. One commenter came out and said:\n\nI’m surprised at your reaction. As far as people I casually stalk on the internet (ie, LJ and Facebook), you are the first out of the “intelligent, reasoned and thoughtful” group to be uncomplicatedly happy about this development and not to be, say, disgusted at the reactions of the other 90% or so.\n\nThis commenter was right. Of the “intelligent, reasoned, and thoughtful” people I knew, the overwhelming emotion was conspicuous disgust that other people could be happy about his death. I hastily backtracked and said I wasn’t happy per se, just surprised and relieved that all of this was finally behind us.\n\nAnd I genuinely believed that day that I had found some unexpected good in people – that everyone I knew was so humane and compassionate that they were unable to rejoice even in the death of someone who hated them and everything they stood for.\n\nThen a few years later, Margaret Thatcher died. And on my Facebook wall – made of these same “intelligent, reasoned, and thoughtful” people – the most common response was to quote some portion of the song “Ding Dong, The Witch Is Dead”. Another popular response was to link the videos of British people spontaneously throwing parties in the street, with comments like “I wish I was there so I could join in”. From this exact same group of people, not a single expression of disgust or a “c’mon, guys, we’re all human beings here.”\n\nI gently pointed this out at the time, and mostly got a bunch of “yeah, so what?”, combined with links to an article claiming that “the demand for respectful silence in the wake of a public figure’s death is not just misguided but dangerous”.\n\nAnd that was when something clicked for me.\n\nYou can talk all you want about Islamophobia, but my friend’s “intelligent, reasoned, and thoughtful people” – her name for the Blue Tribe – can’t get together enough energy to really hate Osama, let alone Muslims in general. We understand that what he did was bad, but it didn’t anger us personally. When he died, we were able to very rationally apply our better nature and our Far Mode beliefs about how it’s never right to be happy about anyone else’s death.\n\nOn the other hand, that same group absolutely loathed Thatcher. Most of us (though not all ) can agree, if the question is posed explicitly, that Osama was a worse person than Thatcher. But in terms of actual gut feeling? Osama provokes a snap judgment of “flawed human being”, Thatcher a snap judgment of “scum”.\n\nI started this essay by pointing out that, despite what geographical and cultural distance would suggest, the Nazis’ outgroup was not the vastly different Japanese, but the almost-identical German Jews.\n\nAnd my hypothesis, stated plainly, is that if you’re part of the Blue Tribe, then your outgroup isn’t al-Qaeda, or Muslims, or blacks, or gays, or transpeople, or Jews, or atheists – it’s the Red Tribe.\n\nVI.\n\n“But racism and sexism and cissexism and anti-Semitism are these giant all-encompassing social factors that verge upon being human universals! Surely you’re not arguing that mere political differences could ever come close to them!”\n\nOne of the ways we know that racism is a giant all-encompassing social factor is the Implicit Association Test. Psychologists ask subjects to quickly identify whether words or photos are members of certain gerrymandered categories, like “either a white person’s face or a positive emotion” or “either a black person’s face and a negative emotion”. Then they compare to a different set of gerrymandered categories, like “either a black person’s face or a positive emotion” or “either a white person’s face or a negative emotion.” If subjects have more trouble (as measured in latency time) connecting white people to negative things than they do white people to positive things, then they probably have subconscious positive associations with white people. You can try it yourself here .\n\nOf course, what the test famously found was that even white people who claimed to have no racist attitudes at all usually had positive associations with white people and negative associations with black people on the test. There are very many claims and counterclaims about the precise meaning of this, but it ended up being a big part of the evidence in favor of the current consensus that all white people are at least a little racist.\n\nAnyway, three months ago, someone finally had the bright idea of doing an Implicit Association Test with political parties , and they found that people’s unconscious partisan biases were half again as strong as their unconscious racial biases (h/t Bloomberg . For example, if you are a white Democrat, your unconscious bias against blacks (as measured by something called a d-score) is 0.16, but your unconscious bias against Republicans will be 0.23. The Cohen’s d for racial bias was 0.61, by the book a “moderate” effect size; for party it was 0.95, a “large” effect size.\n\nOkay, fine, but we know race has real world consequences. Like, there have been several studies where people sent out a bunch of identical resumes except sometimes with a black person’s photo and other times with a white person’s photo, and it was noticed that employers were much more likely to invite the fictional white candidates for interviews. So just some stupid Implicit Association Test results can’t compare to that, right?\n\nIyengar and Westwood also decided to do the resume test for parties. They asked subjects to decide which of several candidates should get a scholarship (subjects were told this was a genuine decision for the university the researchers were affiliated with). Some resumes had photos of black people, others of white people. And some students listed their experience in Young Democrats of America, others in Young Republicans of America.\n\nOnce again, discrimination on the basis of party was much stronger than discrimination on the basis of race. The size of the race effect for white people was only 56-44 (and in the reverse of the expected direction); the size of the party effect was about 80-20 for Democrats and 69-31 for Republicans.\n\nIf you want to see their third experiment, which applied yet another classic methodology used to detect racism and once again found partyism to be much stronger, you can read the paper.\n\nI \u0026 W did an unusually thorough job, but this sort of thing isn’t new or ground-breaking. People have been studying “belief congruence theory” – the idea that differences in beliefs are more important than demographic factors in forming in-groups and outgroups – for decades. As early as 1967, Smith et al were doing surveys all over the country and finding that people were more likely to accept friendships across racial lines than across beliefs; in the forty years since then, the observation has been replicated scores of times. Insko, Moe, and Nacoste’s 2006 review Belief Congruence And Racial Discrimination concludes that:\n\n. The literature was judged supportive of a weak version of belief congruence theory which states that in those contexts in which social pressure is nonexistent or ineffective, belief is more important than race as a determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination. Evidence for a strong version of belief congruence theory (which states that in those contexts in which social pressure is nonexistent, or ineffective, belief is the only determinant of racial or ethnic discrimination) and was judged much more problematic.\n\nOne of the best-known examples of racism is the “Guess Who’s Coming To Dinner” scenario where parents are scandalized about their child marrying someone of a different race. Pew has done some good work on this and found that only 23% of conservatives and 1% (!) of liberals admit they would be upset in this situation. But Pew also asked how parents would feel about their child marrying someone of a different political party . Now 30% of conservatives and 23% of liberals would get upset. Average them out, and you go from 12% upsetness rate for race to 27% upsetness rate for party – more than double. Yeah, people do lie to pollsters, but a picture is starting to come together here.\n\n(Harvard, by the way, is a tossup. There are more black students – 11.5% – than conservative students – 10% – but there are more conservative faculty than black faculty.)\n\nSince people will delight in misinterpreting me here, let me overemphasize what I am not saying. I’m not saying people of either party have it “worse” than black people, or that partyism is more of a problem than racism, or any of a number of stupid things along those lines which I am sure I will nevertheless be accused of believing. Racism is worse than partyism because the two parties are at least kind of balanced in numbers and in resources, whereas the brunt of an entire country’s racism falls on a few underprivileged people. I am saying that the underlying attitudes that produce partyism are stronger than the underlying attitudes that produce racism, with no necessary implications on their social effects.\n\nBut if we want to look at people’s psychology and motivations, partyism and the particular variant of tribalism that it represents are going to be fertile ground.\n\nVII.\n\nEvery election cycle like clockwork, conservatives accuse liberals of not being sufficiently pro-America. And every election cycle like clockwork, liberals give extremely unconvincing denials of this.\n\n“It’s not that we’re, like, against America per se. It’s just that…well, did you know Europe has much better health care than we do? And much lower crime rates? I mean, come on, how did they get so awesome? And we’re just sitting here, can’t even get the gay marriage thing sorted out, seriously, what’s wrong with a country that can’t…sorry, what were we talking about? Oh yeah, America. They’re okay. Cesar Chavez was really neat. So were some other people outside the mainstream who became famous precisely by criticizing majority society. That’s sort of like America being great, in that I think the parts of it that point out how bad the rest of it are often make excellent points. Vote for me!”\n\n(sorry, I make fun of you because I love you)\n\nThere was a big brouhaha a couple of years ago when, as it first became apparent Obama had a good shot at the Presidency, Michelle Obama said that “for the first time in my adult life, I am proud of my country.”\n\nRepublicans pounced on the comment, asking why she hadn’t felt proud before, and she backtracked saying of course she was proud all the time and she loves America with the burning fury of a million suns and she was just saying that the Obama campaign was particularly inspiring.\n\nAs unconvincing denials go, this one was pretty far up there. But no one really held it against her. Probably most Obama voters felt vaguely the same way. I was an Obama voter, and I have proud memories of spending my Fourth of Julys as a kid debunking people’s heartfelt emotions of patriotism. Aaron Sorkin:\n\n[What makes America the greatest country in the world?] It’s not the greatest country in the world! We’re seventh in literacy, 27th in math, 22nd in science, 49th in life expectancy, 178th in infant mortality, third in median household income, No. 4 in labor force, and No. 4 in exports. So when you ask what makes us the greatest country in the world, I don’t know what the f*** you’re talking about.\n\n(Another good retort is “We’re number one? Sure – number one in incarceration rates, drone strikes, and making new parents go back to work!”)\n\nAll of this is true, of course. But it’s weird that it’s such a classic interest of members of the Blue Tribe, and members of the Red Tribe never seem to bring it up.\n\n(“We’re number one? Sure – number one in levels of sexual degeneracy! Well, I guess probably number two, after the Netherlands, but they’re really small and shouldn’t count.”)\n\nMy hunch – both the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe, for whatever reason, identify “America” with the Red Tribe. Ask people for typically “American” things, and you end up with a very Red list of characteristics – guns, religion, barbecues, American football, NASCAR, cowboys, SUVs, unrestrained capitalism.\n\nThat means the Red Tribe feels intensely patriotic about “their” country, and the Blue Tribe feels like they’re living in fortified enclaves deep in hostile territory.\n\nNeedless to say, every single one of these articles was written by an American and read almost entirely by Americans. Those Americans very likely enjoyed the articles very much and did not feel the least bit insulted.\n\nAnd look at the sources. HuffPo, Salon, Slate. Might those have anything in common?\n\nOn both sides, “American” can be either a normal demonym, or a code word for a member of the Red Tribe.\n\nVIII.\n\nThe other day, I logged into OKCupid and found someone who looked cool. I was reading over her profile and found the following sentence:\n\nAnd my first thought was “Wait, so a sexist black person would be okay? Why?”\n\n(The girl in question was white as snow)\n\nSocial media is full of people on both sides making presumptions, and believing what they want to believe. But it’s the white folks that don’t understand what this is all about. Let me put it as simply as I can for you […]\n\nNo matter how wrong you think Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown were, I think we can all agree they didn’t deserve to die over it. I want you white folks to understand that this is where the anger is coming from. You focused on the looting….”\n\nAnd on a hunch I checked the author photos, and every single one of these articles was written by a white person.\n\nWe’ve all seen articles and comments and articles like this. Some unsavory people try to use them to prove that white people are the real victims or the media is biased against white people or something. Other people who are very nice and optimistic use them to show that some white people have developed some self-awareness and are willing to engage in self-criticism.\n\nBut I think the situation with “white” is much the same as the situation with “American” – it can either mean what it says, or be a code word for the Red Tribe.\n\n(except on the blog Stuff White People Like , where it obviously serves as a code word for the Blue tribe. I don’t know, guys. I didn’t do it.)\n\nI realize that’s making a strong claim, but it would hardly be without precedent. When people say things like “gamers are misogynist”, do they mean the 52% of gamers who are women ? Do they mean every one of the 59% of Americans from every walk of life who are known to play video or computer games occasionally? No. “Gamer” is a coded reference to the Gray Tribe, the half-branched-off collection of libertarianish tech-savvy nerds, and everyone knows it. As well expect that when people talk about “fedoras”, they mean Indiana Jones. Or when they talk about “urban youth”, they mean freshmen at NYU. Everyone knows exactly who we mean when we say “urban youth”, and them being young people who live in a city has only the most tenuous of relations to the actual concept.\n\nAnd I’m saying words like “American” and “white” work the same way. Bill Clinton was the “first black President” , but if Herman Cain had won in 2012 he’d have been the 43rd white president. And when an angry white person talks at great length about how much he hates “white dudes”, he is not being humble and self-critical .\n\nIX.\n\nImagine hearing that a liberal talk show host and comedian was so enraged by the actions of ISIS that he’d recorded and posted a video in which he shouts at them for ten minutes, cursing the “fanatical terrorists” and calling them “utter savages” with “savage values”.\n\nIf I heard that, I’d be kind of surprised. It doesn’t fit my model of what liberal talk show hosts do.\n\nBut the story I’m actually referring to is liberal talk show host / comedian Russell Brand making that same rant against Fox News for supporting war against the Islamic State, adding at the end that “Fox is worse than ISIS”.\n\nThat fits my model perfectly. You wouldn’t celebrate Osama’s death, only Thatcher’s. And you wouldn’t call ISIS savages, only Fox News. Fox is the outgroup, ISIS is just some random people off in a desert. You hate the outgroup, you don’t hate random desert people.\n\nI would go further. Not only does Brand not feel much like hating ISIS, he has a strong incentive not to. That incentive is: the Red Tribe is known to hate ISIS loudly and conspicuously. Hating ISIS would signal Red Tribe membership, would be the equivalent of going into Crips territory with a big Bloods gang sign tattooed on your shoulder.\n\nBut this might be unfair. What would Russell Brand answer, if we asked him to justify his decision to be much angrier at Fox than ISIS?\n\nHe might say something like “Obviously Fox News is not literally worse than ISIS. But here I am, talking to my audience, who are mostly white British people and Americans. These people already know that ISIS is bad; they don’t need to be told that any further. In fact, at this point being angry about how bad ISIS is, is less likely to genuinely change someone’s mind about ISIS, and more likely to promote Islamophobia. The sort of people in my audience are at zero risk of becoming ISIS supporters, but at a very real risk of Islamophobia. So ranting against ISIS would be counterproductive and dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, my audience of white British people and Americans is very likely to contain many Fox News viewers and supporters. And Fox, while not quite as evil as ISIS, is still pretty bad. So here’s somewhere I have a genuine chance to reach people at risk and change minds. Therefore, I think my decision to rant against Fox News, and maybe hyperbolically say they were ‘worse than ISIS’ is justified under the circumstances.”\n\nI have a lot of sympathy to hypothetical-Brand, especially to the part about Islamophobia. It does seem really possible to denounce ISIS’ atrocities to a population that already hates them in order to weak-man a couple of already-marginalized Muslims. We need to fight terrorism and atrocities – therefore it’s okay to shout at a poor girl ten thousand miles from home for wearing a headscarf in public. Christians are being executed for their faith in Sudan, therefore let’s picket the people trying to build a mosque next door.\n\nBut my sympathy with Brand ends when he acts like his audience is likely to be fans of Fox News.\n\nIn a world where a negligible number of Redditors oppose gay marriage and 1% of Less Wrongers identify conservative and I know 0/150 creationists, how many of the people who visit the YouTube channel of a well-known liberal activist with a Che-inspired banner, a channel whose episode names are things like “War: What Is It Good For?” and “Sarah Silverman Talks Feminism” – how many of them do you think are big Fox News fans?\n\nIn a way, Russell Brand would have been braver taking a stand against ISIS than against Fox. If he attacked ISIS, his viewers would just be a little confused and uncomfortable. Whereas every moment he’s attacking Fox his viewers are like “HA HA! YEAH! GET ‘EM! SHOW THOSE IGNORANT BIGOTS IN THE OUTGROUP WHO’S BOSS!”\n\nBrand acts as if there are just these countries called “Britain” and “America” who are receiving his material. Wrong. There are two parallel universes, and he’s only broadcasting to one of them.\n\nThe result is exactly what we predicted would happen in the case of Islam. Bombard people with images of a far-off land they already hate and tell them to hate it more, and the result is ramping up the intolerance on the couple of dazed and marginalized representatives of that culture who have ended up stuck on your half of the divide. Sure enough, if industry or culture or community gets Blue enough, Red Tribe members start getting harassed, fired from their jobs (Brendan Eich being the obvious example) or otherwise shown the door.\n\nThink of Brendan Eich as a member of a tiny religious minority surrounded by people who hate that minority. Suddenly firing him doesn’t seem very noble.\n\nIf you mix together Podunk, Texas and Mosul, Iraq, you can prove that Muslims are scary and very powerful people who are executing Christians all the time – and so we have a great excuse for kicking the one remaining Muslim family, random people who never hurt anyone, out of town.\n\nAnd if you mix together the open-source tech industry and the parallel universe where you can’t wear a FreeBSD t-shirt without risking someone trying to exorcise you, you can prove that Christians are scary and very powerful people who are persecuting everyone else all the time, and you have a great excuse for kicking one of the few people willing to affiliate with the Red Tribe, a guy who never hurt anyone, out of town.\n\nWhen a friend of mine heard Eich got fired, she didn’t see anything wrong with it. “I can tolerate anything except intolerance,” she said.\n\n“Intolerance” is starting to look like another one of those words like “white” and “American”.\n\n“I can tolerate anything except the outgroup.” Doesn’t sound quite so noble now, does it?\n\nX.\n\nWe started by asking: millions of people are conspicuously praising every outgroup they can think of, while conspicuously condemning their own in-group. This seems contrary to what we know about social psychology. What’s up?\n\nWe noted that outgroups are rarely literally “the group most different from you”, and in fact far more likely to be groups very similar to you sharing almost all your characteristics and living in the same area.\n\nWe then noted that although liberals and conservatives live in the same area, they might as well be two totally different countries or universe as far as level of interaction were concerned.\n\nContra the usual idea of them being marked only by voting behavior, we described them as very different tribes with totally different cultures. You can speak of “American culture” only in the same way you can speak of “Asian culture” – that is, with a lot of interior boundaries being pushed under the rug.\n\nThe outgroup of the Red Tribe is occasionally blacks and gays and Muslims, more often the Blue Tribe.\n\nThe Blue Tribe has performed some kind of very impressive act of alchemy, and transmuted all of its outgroup hatred to the Red Tribe.\n\nThis is not surprising. Ethnic differences have proven quite tractable in the face of shared strategic aims. Even the Nazis, not known for their ethnic tolerance, were able to get all buddy-buddy with the Japanese when they had a common cause.\n\nResearch suggests Blue Tribe / Red Tribe prejudice to be much stronger than better-known types of prejudice like racism. Once the Blue Tribe was able to enlist the blacks and gays and Muslims in their ranks, they became allies of convenience who deserve to be rehabilitated with mildly condescending paeans to their virtue. “There never was a coward where the shamrock grows.”\n\nSpending your entire life insulting the other tribe and talking about how terrible they are makes you look, well, tribalistic. It is definitely not high class. So when members of the Blue Tribe decide to dedicate their entire life to yelling about how terrible the Red Tribe is, they make sure that instead of saying “the Red Tribe”, they say “America”, or “white people”, or “straight white men”. That way it’s humble self-criticism . They are so interested in justice that they are willing to critique their own beloved side , much as it pains them to do so. We know they are not exaggerating, because one might exaggerate the flaws of an enemy, but that anyone would exaggerate their own flaws fails the criterion of embarrassment .\n\nThe Blue Tribe always has an excuse at hand to persecute and crush any Red Tribers unfortunate enough to fall into its light-matter-universe by defining them as all-powerful domineering oppressors. They appeal to the fact that this is definitely the way it works in the Red Tribe’s dark-matter-universe, and that’s in the same country so it has to be the same community for all intents and purposes. As a result, every Blue Tribe institution is permanently licensed to take whatever emergency measures are necessary against the Red Tribe, however disturbing they might otherwise seem.\n\nAnd so how virtuous, how noble the Blue Tribe! Perfectly tolerant of all of the different groups that just so happen to be allied with them, never intolerant unless it happen to be against intolerance itself. Never stooping to engage in petty tribal conflict like that awful Red Tribe, but always nobly criticizing their own culture and striving to make it better!\n\nSorry. But I hope this is at least a little convincing. The weird dynamic of outgroup-philia and ingroup-phobia isn’t anything of the sort. It’s just good old-fashioned in-group-favoritism and outgroup bashing, a little more sophisticated and a little more sneaky.\n\nXI.\n\nThis essay is bad and I should feel bad.\n\nI should feel bad because I made exactly the mistake I am trying to warn everyone else about, and it wasn’t until I was almost done that I noticed.\n\nHow virtuous, how noble I must be! Never stooping to engage in petty tribal conflict like that silly Red Tribe, but always nobly criticizing my own tribe and striving to make it better.\n\nYeah. Once I’ve written a ten thousand word essay savagely attacking the Blue Tribe, either I’m a very special person or they’re my outgroup. And I’m not that special.\n\nJust as you can pull a fast one and look humbly self-critical if you make your audience assume there’s just one American culture, so maybe you can trick people by assuming there’s only one Blue Tribe.\n\nI’m pretty sure I’m not Red, but I did talk about the Grey Tribe above, and I show all the risk factors for being one of them. That means that, although my critique of the Blue Tribe may be right or wrong, in terms of motivation it comes from the same place as a Red Tribe member talking about how much they hate al-Qaeda or a Blue Tribe member talking about how much they hate ignorant bigots. And when I boast of being able to tolerate Christians and Southerners whom the Blue Tribe is mean to, I’m not being tolerant at all, just noticing people so far away from me they wouldn’t make a good outgroup anyway.\n\nI had fun writing this article. People do not have fun writing articles savagely criticizing their in-group. People can criticize their in-group, it’s not humanly impossible , but it takes nerves of steel, it makes your blood boil, you should sweat blood. It shouldn’t be fun .\n\nYou can bet some white guy on Gawker who week after week churns out “Why White People Are So Terrible” and “Here’s What Dumb White People Don’t Understand” is having fun and not sweating any blood at all. He’s not criticizing his in-group, he’s never even considered criticizing his in-group. I can’t blame him. Criticizing the in-group is a really difficult project I’ve barely begun to build the mental skills necessary to even consider.\n\nI can think of criticisms of my own tribe. Important criticisms, true ones. But the thought of writing them makes my blood boil.\n\nI imagine might I feel like some liberal US Muslim leader, when he goes on the O’Reilly Show, and O’Reilly ambushes him and demands to know why he and other American Muslims haven’t condemned beheadings by ISIS more, demands that he criticize them right there on live TV. And you can see the wheels in the Muslim leader’s head turning, thinking something like “Okay, obviously beheadings are terrible and I hate them as much as anyone. But you don’t care even the slightest bit about the victims of beheadings. You’re just looking for a way to score points against me so you can embarass all Muslims. And I would rather personally behead every single person in the world than give a smug bigot like you a single microgram more stupid self-satisfaction than you’ve already got.”\n\nThat is how I feel when asked to criticize my own tribe, even for correct reasons. If you think you’re criticizing your own tribe, and your blood is not at that temperature, consider the possibility that you aren’t.\n\nBut if I want Self-Criticism Virtue Points, criticizing the Grey Tribe is the only honest way to get them. And if I want Tolerance Points, my own personal cross to bear right now is tolerating the Blue Tribe. I need to remind myself that when they are bad people, they are merely Osama-level bad people instead of Thatcher-level bad people. And when they are good people, they are powerful and necessary crusaders against the evils of the world.\n\nThe worst thing that could happen to this post is to have it be used as convenient feces to fling at the Blue Tribe whenever feces are necessary. Which, given what has happened to my last couple of posts along these lines and the obvious biases of my own subconscious, I already expect it will be.\n\nBut the best thing that could happen to this post is that it makes a lot of people, especially myself, figure out how to be more tolerant. Not in the “of course I’m tolerant, why shouldn’t I be?” sense of the Emperor in Part I. But in the sense of “being tolerant makes me see red, makes me sweat blood, but darn it I am going to be tolerant anyway .”\n\nSupport Slate Star Codex on Patreon .

not knowing - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/on-not-knowing?s=r","content":"on not knowing\n\nThis past week I realized that I’m spectacularly unreassuring in my personal life. As in, whenever someone tells me they’re worried about something, I’m usually like, “Eh, it’ll probably be fine.” When I say that, S pointed out, I usually mean, I believe in your/my ability to deal with the situation so that it’ll be resolved efficiently and without anyone involved incurring significant bodily harm. I do not mean, you will get the outcome you want. I do not mean, you will not be in discomfort or some amount of pain. I definitely do not mean, you will be forgiven, or I love you forever, or there will be no consequences for your stupidity. In short, I don’t say any of the things that the other person actually wants to hear.\n\nNow, I fully acknowledge that this is an annoying quality and I should (and will) try to fix it. But I was also thinking about why I don’t tend to offer more verbal validation. I think it’s because I generally find it unconvincing when other people try to reassure me by asserting certainty where I’m pretty sure there’s none. It feels like thinking in narrative—projecting the future, treating time as a story with a narrative arc.\n\nOf course, you could say, reassurance is not really about the future. It’s about an honest, empathetic assessment of the now. But maybe I’m also not very interested in making definitive statements about the now? As far as I can tell, I view many things as murky and unclear. I don’t always know how I feel, I don’t always know what I want, and many things around me feel nebulous and uncertain. When I write, I do search for clarity. But writing is not the same as living. I don’t think I try to live in a definitive way.\n\nBy that, I don’t necessarily mean that I’m super wishy-washy. I do make decisions all the time, and I make them without too much fuss. I occasionally try to force certain outcomes. I have preferences and beliefs. But I struggle to endow the things that happen to me—and maybe to some extent the things that I do—with meaning. It feels more like a relentless kind of flowing, where I’m naturally drawn in certain directions but I don’t know why. You could say that I’m fatalistic. I’ve noticed that many other people tend to think about their lives in a much more top-down, narrative-driven kind of way. Which—I don’t know. One piece of advice I was given about storytelling is that you often don’t know what the story is really about until you finish it. Similarly, I think most people’s narratives are different from what they think their narratives are. The real story only becomes clear in hindsight.\n\nI was talking to a friend two nights ago about how many people I know suffer from what I call save-the-world syndrome. This is when you believe (and moreover need to believe) that what you’re doing is the most important, special, meaningful thing in the universe. All of your motivation and energy rests on this premise; if it collapses, then your interest in what you’re working on collapses with it. It is, of course, very admirable to want to do good for the world—even admirable to be pretty utilitarian about how you allocate your time and resources—but I think it’s pretty dangerous to slip into the belief that you Know What It Is Important. In my opinion, people develop this brainworm because they’re obsessed with reassurance. They want solidity and certainty: the validation that they’re working on the right thing, loving the right person, not wasting time. That the outcome will always be good, will always get better. That they have not lost the plot.\n\nIt’s true that there’s something unbearable about the feeling of not knowing. There are many people who would rather turn to cults and fanaticism than exist untethered with no one to tell them what to do, no promise of redemption and safety. I’m pretty comfortable with ambivalence, but some days I wake up and am like, I would not mind being more tightly anchored. On some level there’s nothing more seductive than the promise that there’s a moral to the story.

Disinformation. Surveillance. CYBER is Motherboard's podcast and reporting on the dark underbelly of the internet.\n\nA technologist and maintainer of a popular piece of open source software has deliberately sabotaged their own code to wipe data on computers that used the program in Russia and Belarus, and has faced a massive backlash for doing so, according to messages posted on coding repository Github.\n\nThe news signals the potential downsides of digital hacktivism, with the move likely impacting ordinary people that were using the code.\n\nRIAEvangelist is the maintainer of the software called “node-ipc,” a networking tool that’s sometimes downloaded over a million times a week . RIAEvangelist released two modules called “peacenotwar” and “oneday-test” recently, Bleeping Computer reported on Thursday . Peacenotwar, which RIAEvangelist has described as “protestware,” was then included as a dependency in node-ipc’s code , meaning some versions of node-ipc may come bundled with peacenotwar.\n\nDo you know about any other instances of hacking taking place around the Ukraine invasion? We'd love to hear from you. Using a non-work phone or computer, you can contact Joseph Cox securely on Signal on +44 20 8133 5190, Wickr on josephcox, or email joseph.cox@vice.com .\n\n“This code serves as a non-destructive example of why controlling your node modules is important. It also serves as a non-violent protest against Russia's aggression that threatens the world right now. This module will add a message of peace on your users' desktops, and it will only do it if it does not already exist just to be polite,” RIAEvangelist wrote in the description for the peacenotwar code. RIAEvangelist’s description also explained how other people could add the module to their code in order to take part in the digital protest.\n\nOn the GitHub page for peacenotwar, RIAEvangelist included a link to a YouTube video and lyrics from the peace song “One Day” by Mattisyahu, the Jewish American reggae musical artist.\n\nBut then some versions of “node-ipc,” the much more popular piece of software that RIAEvangelist maintains, started overwriting files on computers based in Russia and Belarus with a heart emoji, according to a post on GitHub .\n\nA screenshot of an analysis from GitHub user MidSpike. Image: MidSpike.\n\nRIAEvangelist told Motherboard in an email that “There was no actual code to wipe computers. It only puts a file on the desktop.” He then pointed to a Twitter account he said belonged to him and which had now been targeted by hackers.\n\nHis LinkedIn profile is no longer available. Six hours ago, RIAEvangelist updated the node-ipc page to read “Thanks for all the free pizza, and thanks to all the police that showed up to SWAT me. They were really nice fellas.”\n\nThe GitHub page for node-pic is now full of reactions to RIAEvangelist’s apparent sabotage.\n\n“You’re a stain on the FOSS [free and open source software] community,” reads one. “You just destroyed your work, career and probably your online life,” another adds. Others include links to RIAEvangelist’s social media accounts.\n\nUpdate: This piece has been updated to include a response from RIAEvangelist.\n\nSubscribe to our cybersecurity podcast, CYBER .

Leonardo da Vinci was a studio apprentice to Verrocchio at 14. Walt Disney took on a number of jobs, chiefly delivering papers, from 11 years old. Vladimir Nabokov published his first book (a collection of poems) at 16, while still in school. Andrew Carnegie finished schooling at 12, and was 13 when he began his second job as a telegraph office boy, where he convinced his superiors to teach him the telegraph machine itself. By 16 he was the family’s mainstay of income.\n\nReaders (and often biographers) tend to fixate around the celebrity itself, when people became famous or fortunate. But the early lives, long before success, contain something revealing. Before you grasp, you have to reach. How did they learn to reach?\n\nIn my examples the individuals were all doing from a young age, as opposed to merely schooling. And while they may not have wanted to work, the work was nonetheless something that both they and society felt was useful: something purposeful and appreciated. In a sense they had useful childhoods.\n\nDo children today have useful childhoods?\n\nAgency is the capacity to act. More subtly: An individual’s life can continue, with a certain inertia, that will lead them on to the next year or decade. Most people today more-or-less know what they are going to be doing for the first twenty-or-more years of their life—being in some kind of school (the “doing” is almost more “being told what to do”). Beyond that age there is of course the proverbial worker, in modern stories usually an office worker, who is often so inert that he becomes blindsided by a sudden yank of reality (that forces him out of his inertia, and in doing so the story begins).\n\nGaining agency is gaining the capacity to do something differently from, or in addition to, the events that simply happen to you. Most famous people go off-script early, usually in more than one way. Carnegie becoming a message boy is one opportunity, asking how to operate the telegraph is another. Da Vinci had plenty of small-time commissions, but he quit them in favor of offering his services to the Duke of Milan. And of course no one has to write a book, or start a company. But imagine instead if Carnegie or Da Vinci were compelled to stay in school for ten more years instead. What would have happened?\n\nHistory happens only once, it never repeats. I find it striking just how early, and how varied, the avenues were that allowed one to pivot off-script, to do something differently than everyone else. For a 13 year old today, what is the equivalent of being a telegraph office boy, where he can learn technology while contributing? What about for a 16 year old? 21 year old? What is today’s equivalent to being a studio apprentice of Verrocchio?\n\nWhere are the studios, anyway?\n\nThe world until recently was overflowing with onramps of opportunity, even for children, and we seem to do poorly at producing new ones. Modern complexity may have erased some avenues for agency (no boy can meaningfully learn the telegraph), but I suspect how we have oriented the world, not technology, is the main problem. 13-year-old Steve Jobs called Bill Hewlett and received a summer job at HP, which would be unsurprising in Carnegie’s time, was certainly surprising for 1968, and is obviously verboten today.\n\nWe seem to have a political (public) imagination so shallow that it cannot conceive of what to even do with children, especially smart children. We fail to properly respect them all the way through adolescence, so we have engineered them to be useless in the interim. We do not need children to work, that is abundantly clear, but by ensuring there is nothing for them to do we are also sure to destroy more onramps towards making meaningful contributions to the world.\n\nMuch of the fault for this lies in an attempt at systematizing skill and knowledge transfer so thoroughly that people begin to conceive of it as the task of school, rather than a normal consequence of work. Because of this shift, childhood contains the age where one can intuit very well how the world works while being prevented from acting upon it meaningfully. Instead of an adolescence full of rites of passage, where one attempts to master something and accept responsibility, we have made it full of waiting, and doing work—for school is work—that nearly everyone knows is fake. After a time all children spot this fakeness, and all honest educators note it:\n\nWho could blame young adults for thinking that work is fake and meaningless if we prescribe fake and meaningless work for the first two decades of their existence? By confining meaningful work to an adult-only activity, it is little wonder that adolescence is a period of great depression. It would be surprising if it was not. Even for smart children, education endlessly ushers them towards an often far and always abstract future, so far and abstract that some children seem to apprise the opposite of agency, they take on a learned helplessness, and downplay that the future is a reality at all.\n\n(The tail end of this problem is precisely what the Thiel Fellowship illustrated, and went on to solve for as many people as it can.)\n\nThis is not worship of employment, but a simpler observation: It seems that the more you ask of people, and the more you have them do, the more they are able to later do on their own. It is important to note that while we shouldn’t allow children to be bobbin boys, no one would describe Steve Job’s summer job at 13 as his exploitation. We should be thinking much harder about making sure children can make meaningful contributions to the world.\n\nSeizing opportunity requires opportunity to exist at all. And I suspect the downplaying of agency in childhood not only creates fewer opportunities for great people, it must also create more marginal people. Ushering everyone into an endless default script is disastrous when underlying conditions or assumptions change. Even when they don’t, some people exit academia almost terrified to leave (to interact with the “real world”), a kind of Stockholm syndrome. How could we celebrate a higher learning that creates something so pathetic, the opposite of a readiness for life?\n\n(Systematized youth is by far not the only culprit of a loss of agency. By attributing success and failures almost exclusively to outgroups, systems, society, etc., modern ideology seeks to actively downplay agency .)\n\nThere is no reason the world must stay this way, the internet has already rebirthed some informal skill transfer that once existed . This constitutes a beautiful reawakening of meaningful work for anyone interested, and is one of the most significant changes from prior decades. For that matter there might be more tools than ever for clever parents to route around the destruction of a meaningful adolescence, but that does not make it less disquieting.\n\n(There are good reasons that programming is now the typical industry for precocious children. It is something parents can still allow their children to do despite systematized schooling, and it is also one of the few industries with a permissionless culture. You don’t have to ask anyone. You don’t have to get a building permit or be a professional. You can just create. This too is a big change from the pre-internet era, and incidentally the reason I became a programmer. I wanted to make things, school did not offer avenues to create, but Geocities did. In fact it was one of the only sources in my childhood simply saying, you don’t have to wait for professionals to tell you how to make stuff, you can just make stuff. Start typing.)\n\nThe act of creation causes imagination, not the other way around. To understand this is to understand the ecology that fosters the unique . Agency is precious because the lucidities that purposeful work and responsibility bring are the real education. The secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.\n\nThis topic, like always, cannot be said to be finished, and must contain others at a distance.\n\nHeading image: The Education of Achilles by Eugène Delacroix, 1862\n\nThe two painters became lifelong friends in 1847.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Directions and Advice - Alexey Guzey","link":"https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life","content":"I ask a lot of people about their life plans. At least half of them tell me that they have no idea where to move and are just coasting along, not sure what to do next. Therefore, this post.\n\nEmailing people you don’t know can be shockingly effective.\n\nThere’s an unwritten rule that you shouldn’t do it, but if you actually provide value you can connect with almost anyone instantly and for free.\n\nCold emails and twitter are a godsend for people who have high potential, but lack the opportunity to realize it. A few emails or tweets to a person you don’t know can literally change your life (they changed mine for sure!)\n\nIf you can demonstrate that you have high potential and/or can be useful to somebody, you should just email/tweet them and let them know about it. If you’re thinking “well, I’m not impressive enough” you’re likely wrong.\n\nHere are two examples of my cold emails that worked: first , second . It appears that 20-50% of cold emails end up getting answered and while the experience can be nerve-wrecking and confidence-destroying, ultimately, it pays off.\n\n(if you think that I’m good at writing cold emails - it wasn’t always like that. e.g. here’s one I wrote when I was 19 to a professor in my university I didn’t know and here’s one that I wrote to someone on the internet when I was 15; I’m super embarrassed by them and I’m fortunate that I got replies)\n\nMany projects only require you to have a computer and some free time. Some actually require funding. For them, see:\n\nThiel Fellowship : $100,000 for people under 23 “who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom”\n\nEinstein Fellowship is “a fellowship for outstanding young thinkers who wish to pursue a project in a different field from that of their previous research.”\n\nEmergent Ventures “seeks to support entrepreneurs and brilliant minds with highly scalable, “zero to one” ideas for meaningfully improving society”\n\nAnd if you’re starting a company, then you can try to get more conventional VC funding.\n\nHow to Do What You Love by Paul Graham:\n\nAnother test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don’t take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you’re producing, you’ll know you’re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you’re actually writing.\n\n“Always produce” is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you’re supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. “Always produce” will discover your life’s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof.\n\nIn my experience, the way you end up doing good in the world has very little to do with how good your initial plan was. Most of your outcome will depend on luck, timing, and your ability to actually get out of your own way and start somewhere. The way to end up with a good plan is not to start with a good plan, it’s to start with some plan, and then slam that plan against reality until reality hands you a better plan.\n\nBut the permanent effect was this: Kimo’s high expectations set a new pace for me. He taught me “the standard pace is for chumps” — that the system is designed so anyone can keep up. If you’re more driven than “just anyone” — you can do so much more than anyone expects. And this applies to all of life — not just school.\n\nBeing at the Top of B-Tier will sufficient to get you a job. But, you’re probably screwed already. And, even if you’d gotten into a better school, trying to “Win” the Best-of-B-Tier competition is a stupid waste of time and money.\n\nInstead, you want: (1) A professional accomplishment (2) that’s not part of your classes and (3) is acknowledged by a professional in your field.\n\nSo, I’ve invented The Working Resume™. It doesn’t list your academic credentials or any of your prior employers. It doesn’t show any of your past experience and it doesn’t list any jobs you ever did. No accomplishments, no achievements or awards. (Blasphemous, isn’t it?) So, what do you put on it?\n\nThings Many People Find Too Obvious To Have Told You Already by Patrick McKenzie:\n\nCompanies find it incredibly hard to reliably staff positions with hard-working generalists who operate autonomously and have high risk tolerances. This is not the modal employee, including at places which are justifiably proud of the skill/diligence/etc of their employees. …\n\nWeak-form efficients market hypothesis is a good heuristic for evaluating the public markets but a really, really bad heuristic for evaluating either technical or economic facts about tech companies, startups, your career, etc etc. Optimizations are possible; fruit hangs low.\n\nI’ll close with my usual advice to peers: reading this email was valuable (knock on wood). Watching Jason’s video is valuable. Rolling up your sleeves and actually shipping something is much, much more valuable. If you take no other advice from me ever, ship something. You’ll learn more shipping a failure than you’ll learn from reading about a thousand successes. And you stand an excellent chance of shipping a success – people greatly overestimate how difficult this is.\n\nJust don’t end the week with nothing.\n\nOther product tropes also apply to careers: Capitalize on unfair advantages, insights, or relationships. Disrupt orthogonally, often from below—try not to compete head on. When you’re younger, take more market risk; when you’re more experienced, take execution risk.\n\nHowever, certain mistakes product builders make also carry over to careers — namely, focusing on acquisition instead of retention (focusing on networking instead of relationships \u0026 reputation). Or working in a space that doesn’t get more valuable over time (e.g working in a dying industry), or building another “me-too” product without differentiation (not taking enough career risk).\n\nAll the evidence-based advice we found on how to be successful in any job by Benjamin Todd on 80,000 Hours\n\nHow to Maximize Serendipity by David Perell\n\nHOWTO: Be more productive by Aaron Swartz","tokenFrequency":{"peer":1,"staff":1,"effect":2,"coast":1,"howev":2,"therefor":1,"chanc":1,"support":1,"differenti":1,"slam":1,"don't":4,"outstand":1,"serious":1,"career":4,"noth":1,"novel":1,"howto":1,"close":1,"move":1,"appear":1,"serendip":1,"":33,"realli":2,"rule":1,"page":1,"tell":1,"told":1,"pursu":1,"acknowledg":1,"ventur":1,"peopl":6,"obstruct":1,"younger":1,"two":1,"set":1,"you'r":11,"find":4,"society”":1,"better":2,"stand":1,"aaron":1,"19":1,"differ":1,"network":1,"novelist":1,"lack":1,"carri":1,"fortun":1,"godsend":1,"improv":1,"without":1,"somewher":1,"tech":1,"gotten":1,"hand":1,"opportun":1,"work":7,"palpabl":1,"usual":1,"watch":1,"flaw":1,"reliabl":1,"wrong":1,"mine":1,"second":1,"univers":1,"half":1,"didn't":1,"hole":1,"let":1,"fund":2,"liter":1,"toward":1,"pace":2,"pay":1,"advantag":1,"new":2,"i'll":1,"success":3,"80000":1,"retent":1,"grand":1,"take":5,"constraint":1,"luck":1,"instead":4,"post":1,"cold":4,"email":7,"connect":1,"“metoo”":1,"evidencebas":1,"entrepreneur":1,"previous":1,"even":1,"anyone”":1,"“well":1,"oper":1,"depend":1,"wasn't":1,"execut":1,"demonstr":1,"23":1,"heurist":3,"mind":1,"difficult":1,"driven":1,"time":4,"david":1,"show":1,"tri":2,"isn't":1,"includ":1,"you'll":3,"profession":2,"roof":1,"initi":1,"push":1,"etc":2,"research”":1,"fellowship":3,"nervewreck":1,"hardwork":1,"actual":6,"invent":1,"school":2,"paul":1,"system":1,"world":1,"instant":1,"answer":1,"capit":1,"public":1,"stupid":1,"learn":2,"abil":1,"failur":1,"super":1,"see":1,"hang":1,"often":1,"autonom":1,"requir":2,"ask":1,"vc":1,"benjamin":1,"aid":1,"mere":1,"class":1,"blasphem":1,"wish":1,"bestofbti":1,"“just":1,"credenti":1,"overestim":1,"hard":1,"advic":3,"embarrass":1,"automat":1,"die":1,"sure":2,"evalu":2,"thousand":1,"i'v":1,"think":3,"ultim":1,"unfair":1,"fruit":1,"know":5,"risk":4,"money":1,"day":2,"mckenzi":1,"unwritten":1,"use":3,"“a":1,"place":1,"good":6,"experi":3,"weakform":1,"name":1,"justifi":1,"like":3,"fiction":1,"btier":1,"head":1,"thinker":1,"todd":1,"enough":1,"valuabl":4,"classroom”":1,"love":2,"week":1,"discov":1,"accomplish":2,"insight":1,"someth":2,"appli":2,"view":1,"mani":2,"builder":1,"almost":1,"“seek":1,"video":1,"einstein":1,"alreadi":2,"tweet":1,"screw":1,"“zero":1,"ship":4,"field":2,"get":5,"–":1,"least":1,"maxim":1,"modal":1,"hypothesi":1,"mistak":1,"way":4,"“the":1,"here":2,"effici":1,"long":1,"someon":1,"doesn't":4,"wood":1,"subject":1,"great":1,"sit":1,"sleev":1,"convent":1,"relationship":2,"idea":2,"found":1,"…":1,"technic":1,"suppos":1,"generalist":1,"realiti":2,"there":1,"comput":1,"“alway":2,"test":1,"high":5,"compani":3,"meaning":1,"employe":2,"achiev":1,"certain":1,"realiz":1,"opiat":1,"plan":9,"brilliant":1,"hazi":1,"eg":2,"chumps”":1,"part":1,"ever":2,"project":2,"exampl":2,"wrote":2,"first":1,"make":1,"acquisit":1,"produc":3,"got":1,"shock":1,"focus":2,"twitter":1,"scalabl":1,"disrupt":1,"market":3,"andor":1,"excel":1,"next":1,"“who":1,"possibl":1,"incred":1,"much":3,"industri":1,"keep":1,"repli":1,"taught":1,"build":2,"want":2,"thing":4,"emerg":1,"bad":2,"“win”":1,"jason":1,"also":3,"optim":1,"wast":1,"proud":1,"standard":1,"confidencedestroy":1,"graham":1,"design":1,"startup":1,"employ":1,"start":4,"resume™":1,"somebodi":1,"competit":1,"product":4,"provid":1,"put":1,"2050":1,"15":1,"top":1,"read":2,"that":1,"obvious":1,"roll":1,"i'm":4,"kimo":1,"—":4,"perman":1,"emailtweet":1,"expect":2,"professor":1,"compet":1,"it":1,"list":2,"suffici":1,"experienc":1,"away":1,"past":1,"thiel":1,"below—tri":1,"potenti":2,"anoth":2,"free":2,"skilldiligenceetc":1,"along":1,"job":4,"alway":2,"chang":2,"patrick":1,"write":4,"produce”":2,"award":1,"vision":1,"swartz":1,"hour":1,"anyon":3,"posit":1,"impress":1,"person":1,"internet":1,"academ":1,"shouldn't":1,"prior":1,"probabl":1,"reput":1,"littl":1,"young":1,"econom":1,"trope":1,"you'd":1,"water":1,"$100000":1,"toler":1,"either":1,"low":1,"outcom":1,"graviti":1,"end":4,"valu":1,"orthogon":1,"lot":1,"one”":1,"one":4,"space":1,"enough”":1,"life":4,"fact":1,"knock":1,"perel":1}},"20251":{"id":"20251","title":"OpenPrinciples","link":"https://openprinciples.notion.site/OpenPrinciples-681ecdace05b4eda91afee4d91c1df1d","content":"","tokenFrequency":{}},"21717":{"id":"21717","title":"being open to magic - by Spencer Chang - spencer's thoughts","link":"https://spencerchang.substack.com/p/being-open-to-magic?s=r","content":"being open to magic\n\nI've been thinking about the concept of home and digital homelessness recently with a prompt from my friend jasmine , especially with my time in nyc lately feeling out what it feels like to be a part of that community.\n\nA lot of people who live in New York talk about the incredible, overwhelming social presence of the city. It's neverending fun. There's always more to do. At the same time, I talked to someone who hadn't found a community that they identified with in New York, like they found visiting SF. I find that dichotomy interesting, how so much of the outward aesthetic of NYC is tied to the enriching social sphere and so much of the SF aesthetic of great nature, tech bros, and unbearable rent is definitively not that.\n\nI suspect that friend found what Andy describes as a hard to discover but very real \"weird people taking ideas v seriously\" scene.\n\nThere's something to be said about the depth of knowledge here. There's a quiet dedication to craft that can be felt that I have found in rare pockets in other places. I wonder if it has to the do with the extremity of the area: the abundance of beautiful nature with the constant fear of petty crime, the rich multicultural history and the Great Gentrification, the flourishing origin of various creative endeavors and the overwhelming societal and economic pressure to be efficient and productive. Perhaps that constant tension between a beautiful future and a fearful one throws into sharp relief the hopeful vision of what could be. We dedicate ourselves to our craft and our purpose and our nature, all the things we love, to preserve that fateful hope for the kind of future we can inhabit.\n\nI love that part of San Francisco. That optimistic aura is the indescribable thing that caught my heart in the first place. I moved out as a naive college student dreaming of working at Google to make the world a better place, and I've grown into a semi-responsible adult who grapples with the inherent conflict of putting that ideology into practice, while still dreaming like a child of creating things that make somebody's world better. I hope I never lose that playful part of me—the child that jumps for joy over those perfect breezy cloudless days, obsesses over exploring the ends of a new toy, and sheepishly subverts the rules of recipes and guidelines in the hopes of creating a new thing of beauty.\n\nFrom my visit to New York and noticing why I was enjoying the community there so much, I think it's because I was giving so much of myself to the community there as I was visiting, whereas in SF, I'm so settled in now (and used to the heat of COVID quarantine life) that I've neglected to do that. I've grown to be self-sufficient, so I never need to rely on or even interact with the different communities here. In so many ways, SF feels like a home because of the vibe that I described above and how I'm able to focus on my creative endeavors, but it felt like it was missing a piece of that community I found in New York.\n\nWhile I think the density of New York makes it a lot easier to discover that community there, SF has plenty of that to offer. I think I just need to do a better job of opening myself up to the magic . I do this to a lot of success with nature (well it's not hard given how much of it is around the city)—often telling friends who question my relationship with SF that I fall in love with the city again every time I see golden hour bathe the bridge and the waterfront in dazzling lights and the steady red blinking of Sutro Tower set against the purple and orange horizon.\n\nI think the key is to stay fully settled in yourself while opening yourself up to opportunities and experiences that might be fulfilling. I'm reminded of the idea of micro-interactions from the Convivial Society and Jane Jacobs and how every interaction is an opportunity to connect with the community. In the spirit of mutualism , I want to open myself up to the community through these micro-interactions.\n\nAny suggestions or ideas for finding or engaging with these micro-interactions with the community?

In that spirit, here's some quick Things Many People Find Too Obvious To Have Told You Already.\n\nYour idea is not valuable, at all. All value is in the execution. You think you are an exception; you are not. You should not insist on an NDA to talk about it; nobody serious will engage in contract review over an idea, and this will mark you as clueless.\n\nTechnologists tend to severely underestimate the difficulty and expense of creating software, especially at companies which do not have fully staffed industry leading engineering teams (\"because software is so easy there, amirite guys?\") Charge more. Charge more still. Go on.\n\nThe press is a lossy and biased compression of events in the actual world, and is singularly consumed with its own rituals, status games, and incentives. The news necessarily fails to capture almost everything which happened yesterday. What it says is important usually isn't.\n\nCompanies find it incredibly hard to reliably staff positions with hard-working generalists who operate autonomously and have high risk tolerances. This is not the modal employee, including at places which are justifiably proud of the skill/diligence/etc of their employees.\n\nThe hardest problem in B2C is distribution. The hardest problem in B2B is sales. AppAmaGooBookSoft are AppAmaGooBookSoft primarily because they have mortal locks on distribution.\n\nEveryone in Silicon Valley uses equity, and not debt, to fuel their growth because debt is not available in sufficient quantities to poorly capitalized companies without a strong history of adequate cash flows to service debt.\n\nInvestors in venture-back companies are purchasing a product. It is critically important to understand that that product is growth. The reason tech is favored as an asset class that it appears to be one of few sources of growth available on the market at the moment at any price.\n\nThe explosive growth of the tech sector keeps average age down and depresses average wages. Compared to industries which existed in materially the same form in 1970, we have a stupidly compressed experience spectrum: 5+ years rounds to \"senior.\" This is not a joke.\n\nThe tech industry is fundamentally unserious about how it recruits, hires, and retains candidates. About which I have a lot more to say than could fit in a tweet, but, a good thing to know.\n\nIf you are attempting to hire for an engineering position, greater than 50% of people who apply for the job and whose resume you select as \"facially plausible\" will be entirely unable to program, at all. The search term for learning more about this is FizzBuzz.\n\nSoftware companies in B2B which aspire to growing quickly will eventually spend more on sales and marketing than they do on engineering. You can read S-1s of successful IPOs and calculate the ratio; it is sometimes 2X++.\n\nThe chief products of the tech industry are (in B2C) developing new habits among consumers and (in B2B) taking a business process which exists in many places and markedly decreasing the total cost of people required to implement it.\n\nThere is no hidden reserve of smart people who know what they're doing, anywhere. Not in government, not in science, not in tech, not at AppAmaGooBookSoft, nowhere. The world exists in the same glorious imperfection that it presents with.\n\nSignificant advances shipped by the tech industry in the last 20 years include putting the majority of human knowledge in the hands of 40%++ of the world's population, available on-demand, for \"coffee money\" not \"university money.\"\n\nWeak-form efficients market hypothesis is a good heuristic for evaluating the public markets but a really, really bad heuristic for evaluating either technical or economic facts about tech companies, startups, your career, etc etc. Optimizations are possible; fruit hangs low.\n\nStartups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists. People underestimate how effective a generalist can be at things which are done by specialists. People underestimate how deep specialties can run. These are simultaneously true.\n\nMost open source software is written by programmers who are full-time employed by companies which directly consume the software, at the explicit or implicit blessing of their employers. It is not charity work, any more than they charitably file taxes.\n\nThe amount of money flowing through capitalism would astound you. The number and variety of firms participating in the economy would astound you. We don't see most of it every day for the same reason abstractions protect us from having to care about metallurgy while programming.\n\nCS programs have, in the main, not decided that the primary path to becoming a programmer should involve doing material actual programming. There are some exceptions: Waterloo, for example. This is the point where I joke \"That's an exhaustive list\" but not sure that a joke.\n\nTechnical literacy in the broader population can be approximated with the Thanksgiving test: what sort of questions do you get at Thanksgiving? That's the ambient level of literacy. Serious people in positions of power eat Thanksgiving dinners, too. Guess what they ask at them.\n\nSalaries in the tech industry are up *a lot* in the last few years, caused by: a tight labor market, collapse of a cartel organized against the interests of workers, increasing returns to scale at AppAmaGooBookSoft, and the like. Investor money *does not* pay most salaries.\n\nThis concludes, for the moment, an off-the-cuff list of things which would otherwise be too obvious to bring up in conversation. Meta thought: you radically underestimate both a) how much you know that other people do not and b) the instrumental benefits to you of publishing it.\n\nMissing some Tweet in this thread?You can try to force a refresh\n\nGet real-time email alerts when new unrolls are available from this author!\n\nTwitter may remove this content at anytime, convert it as a PDF, save and print for later use!\n\n1) Follow Thread Reader App on Twitter so you can easily mention us!\n\n2) Go to a Twitter thread (series of Tweets by the same owner) and mention us with a keyword \"unroll\" @threadreaderapp unroll\n\nYou can practice here first or read more on our help page !\n\nTranslated: “A SaaS company with over $100k in MRR basically can’t die and one with $1M in MRR can’t be killed”I have one teeny quibble with this, which I otherwise endorse:\n\nA SaaS company with $100k MRR which is growing quickly can probably retain the founders and other talent. A company which hits that but is not growing quickly *and* competes with the labor market might end up strangled by the opportunity cost.\n\nThis is less relevant to e.g. Tokyo or non-hubs in the US, but AppAmaGooFaceSoft sees a $1 M a year SaaS business as a PM that they could put in charge of a business 100X as large and some other stuff too. And they will persuasively communicate that worldview, attached to checks.\n\nI’m often surprised when reading about startups that critics move to envisioning a world where the startup has won so totally that there is no alternative to their model, which is not what the victory case looks like.\n\nThought prompted by (paraphrase) “Who will cross-subsidize the education of non-renumerative-occupation-of-interest after Lambda School is educating every professional in capitalism?”\n\nAnd as much as I share enthusiasm for living in that hypothetical universe good golly there is a heck of a lot of work between the status quo and the first 1% of that outcome.\n\nUsing a Chromebook for the first time and reflecting that given how much of my workday is in Google applications and other generic web apps this might be a perfectly adequate main computer if one isn’t doing development (on which I have no read on it).\n\nI always thought “You’ll pry MS Office from my cold dead hands” but these days 98% of what I use it for is handled by Google Docs. (It helps that almost all docs I care about are internal and began life in Google Docs.)\n\nAlso Google seems to have discovered a revolutionary technology called a “keyboard” where you mechanically actuate a switch and it results in a character of input to your machine. Apple should steal that.\n\nRelated threads\n\nAnd still this inconsistent colonial construct of mine keeps on menstruating, gestating, and lactating, like the bodies of so many other mammals. Hey! Wouldn't it be useful if there was a word for bodies like mine?\n\nThe truth of this lies in the sophomoric observation that classification and labelling of stuff in the world is influenced by the values and beliefs we bring to it. We notice sex differences and label people \"male\" and \"female\" because we believe this distinction is significant.\n\nWell, sure. But since there is unlikely to be a human society anywhere in the world where this distinction is *not* significant, it is ludicrous to claim that sex is a colonial construct. Are there any societies anywhere that don't know the difference between males and females?\n\nSo, I've waded through the Evangelical Alliance's new pastoral \"guidelines\" for interacting with trans people (ughh, the things I do to expose #transphobic #ciswits to the world), and let's just say it's time to tear this particular sh*t-bag a new hole.\n\nSo, straight off the bat, first page of text, the use of #language is . . . well, yeah, see for yourself:\"It is important to remember that transgender is not simply an issue to be debated;\" - p5, #Transformed *sigh*When such language gets reinforced by insisting...\n\nParticle Man is such a weird song to try to unpack, and in fact, I'm marking myself as a TMBG nerd by even considering it. According to The Johns, it has no meaning at all. It just is what it is. tmbw.net/wiki/Particle_… And yet...\n\nIn the words of Roland Barthes in La mort de l'auteur, \"To give a text an author is to impose a limit on that text.\" The creator of a work of art is a collaborator and instigator of its meaning, but should not ever be seen as the final authority of that meaning.\n\nThe song is a bouncy play on the Spider-Man theme, and presents a few characters in brief vignettes. Particle Man, the unknowably small Triangle Man, the violent and hateful Universe Man, the unknowably large Person Man, the human condition\n\nSo.Time for something a little different, and an idea I’ve been toying with—a look at how #transphobes try to frame their narrative within a claim that they are only “concerned” about trans people existing.I think it’s safe to say that every trans person in the...\n\ncommunity who isn’t a #transphobic arserag can now spot whenever the usual #hate groups and individuals deploy their dog-whistles to denigrate trans people, especially trans women, but it is all too easy to forget that for the average cis person with no experience of...\n\nthis the comments and phrases that #transphobes come out with can come across as bizarre, or non-sequiturs, or even occasionally even reasonable. That person, because they have no experience of this, doesn’t see those comments as the attacks they are, and so can’t...\n\nExternal Tweet loading...If nothing shows, it may have been deletedby @carriecuinn view original on Twitter\n\nI think part of this sort of world building comes from the way we teach history as static eras, as How Things Are.I do it still conversationally \"this is what the Victorians thought\", \"this is what they did\", all of which implicitly centres the powerful.\n\nAnd thus when I come to take ideas from those eras, I end up stapling airships onto the most conservative, static parts of it. I say this as someone who has written way too many essays on corn laws. The categories and methods we learn in childhood follow us.\n\nExternal Tweet loading...If nothing shows, it may have been deletedby @jeannette_ng view original on Twitter\n\nI've been thinking about this quote from the bad whale science in children's book article a lot since yesterday\n\nWe need to have a nuanced conversation about chemical anti-depressants. Take a look at this story: theguardian.com/science/2018/f…\n\nA Guardian blogger claimed that my book tells people to stop taking anti-depressants \u0026 this idea got quite widely spread. My book doesn’t say that. Their readers’ editor has now issued a clarification.\n\nIn fact it says, p37: “I don’t want to take away anything that gives anyone some relief. If for you the benefits outweigh the side-effects, you should carry on.” That’s been my advice to my own relatives.\n\nTrending hashtags\n\n\u003cdiv id=\"tttt_936615043126370306\" data-option=\"1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/936615043126370306.html\"\u003eThread by @patio11: \"Some people really benefit from hearing advice that everyone knows, for the same reason we keep schools open despite every subject in them h […]\"\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/embed/936615043126370306.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\nSupport us!

You Reverse Any Advice You Hear? | Slate Star Codex","link":"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/24/should-you-reverse-any-advice-you-hear","content":"Suppose a lot of that stuff about bravery debates is right.\n\nThat lots of the advice people give is useful for some people, but that the opposite advice is useful for other people.\n\nFor example, “You need to stop being so hard on yourself, remember you are your own worst critic” versus “Stop making excuses for yourself, you will never be able to change until you admit you’ve hit bottom.”\n\nOr “You need to remember that the government can’t solve all problems and that some regulations are counterproductive” versus “You need to remember that the free market can’t solve all problems and that some regulations are necessary.”\n\nOr “You need to pay more attention to your diet or you’ll end up very unhealthy” versus “You need to pay less attention to your weight or you’ll end up in a spiral of shame and self-loathing and at risk of eating disorders.”\n\nOr “Follow your dreams, you don’t want to be working forever at a job you hate”, versus “Your dream of becoming a professional cosplayer may not be the best way to ensure a secure future for your family, go into petroleum engineering instead.”\n\nOr “You need to be more conscious of how your actions in social situations can make other people uncomfortable and violate their boundaries” versus “You need to overcome your social phobia by realizing that most interactions go well and that probably talking to people won’t always make them hate you and cause you to be ostracized forever.”\n\nOr “You need to be less selfish and more considerate of the needs of others” versus “You can’t live for others all the time, you need to remember you deserve to be happy as well.”\n\nPeople often form groups based on pushing one or another side of these dichotomies. Most obviously, the Libertarian Party pushes one side of the political-regulation one and the Communist Party pushes the other. The fat acceptance movement pushes one side of the diet-health one and the American Heart Association pushes the other. Some religious groups and the effective altruism movement push one side of charity-selfishness, the Objectivists push the other.\n\nMost of these groups have the stated purpose of moving society as a whole, but their primary short-term effect is to change the opinions of their members.\n\nFor example, maybe you join the Objectivist movement. You follow lots of Objectivist blogs that give you strong arguments for selfishness, hear lots of anecdotes of people being hurt by excessive altruism, and get exposed to any studies that seem to support the pro-selfishness point of view. You probably end up more selfish than you were before you joined the Objectivists.\n\nConsider two possible interpretations of that result.\n\nFirst, Objectivism might be a successful support group. People who aren’t selfish enough realize they need more selfishness in their lives, join the Objectivists, and support each other as they work to overcome their inbuilt disposition to ignore their own needs. Gradually they all become psychologically healthier people.\n\nOr second, Objectivism might be a vicious cycle. The people who are already too selfish see an opportunity to be selfish with a halo. They join Objectivism, egg each other on, and become even more selfish still. Meanwhile, the people who could really have benefitted from Objectivism, the people who feel guilted into living for others all the time while ignoring their own needs, are off in some kind of effective charity group, egging each other on to be even more self-destructively altruistic.\n\nThe first dynamic definitely sometimes exists, and in fact I was cued in to this whole issue from a friend in the first situation who was genuinely helped by Objectivism.\n\nBut I think the second dynamic is usually more common. It’s much easier to join a group that celebrates your natural proclivities than one that demands you fight against them. Then you end up with dueling death spirals in which two separate communities become more and more certain of their own position.\n\nI was talking to a friend on Facebook about marriage (I’ll default to anonymous; she can identify herself in comments if she wants). She was annoyed at a blog that criticized a supposed group of people who jumped into marriage unreflectively because they felt divorce was an easy and low cost escape if it didn’t go well. She thought this was a cheap shot, which of course it is.\n\nBut I pointed out that this criticism really wasn’t entirely off the mark, because these people exist and are in fact very common. The fallout from their recklessness sometimes requires a psychiatrist to help sort out, so I meet them and their children in treatment all the time.\n\nAnd she said that sure, these people do exist, but there are a lot of people who are stuck in abusive relationships and already feel like divorce is too stigmatizing, and we shouldn’t be too quick to mock people who jump to divorce because that’s just going to make it harder for these people to get the divorces they really need.\n\nAnd I said that okay, definitely those people existed as well, but it seemed kind of unfair for this demographic to hold hostage society’s ability to suggest people be more responsible with marriage and divorce, when there are so many people who would benefit from that advice.\n\nAnd she said that yes, it would be nice to provide these irresponsible people the information that they need to think carefully before making major life choices, but that these probably weren’t the sort of people who read preachy conservative blogs about the virtues of the married life anyway.\n\nAnd I didn’t have a good answer to that, because it was obviously true. The best I could do was point out that this would delegitimize pretty much all discourse. Every piece of social commentary is most likely to go to the people who need it least.\n\nFor just this reason I worry that everything I post on my blog is correct, but wrong relative to readers of my blog. For example, I post about how everyone needs to be much more mindful of the role biological factors play in human social systems . And I’m 99% sure that the average person is not sufficiently aware of or concerned about this.\n\nBut I’m much less certain that the average reader of my blog isn’t sufficiently aware or concerned about this. Maybe people who are really interested in biodeterminism search “biodeterminism” on Google, find my blog and several others, and end up way too biodeterminist. Maybe their time would be much better served reading some blog on how many things are due to fuzzy hard-to-measure social factors like who your third-grade teacher was.\n\nAnd when a young person is looking for job advice, I worry that all the artsy creative people whose heads are already way too high in the skies will be reading books by artsy creative people who urge them to follow their dreams, and so be even less mindful of the importance of a secure future. And all the hard-headed down-to-earth people will naturally gravitate toward reading Have A Very Secure Future By Going Into Business by Warren Buffett, and maybe never get reminded of the importance of following dreams.\n\n(This is even sadder when the groups aren’t equal in size, when society is much more in need of one side than the other, but that group is stuck in a tiny but super-intense inward-facing spiral. The Venn diagram of the people who most need to learn about LGBTQ rights compared against the people who most often hear about LGBTQ rights consists of two circles, one in Canada and the other in Peru. And so we end up with a big community of people who want trans people bullied out of society, plus a tiny community who spend a lot of time panicking that they might be unintentionally offensive by using the wrong form of “trans-” vs. “trans*”.)\n\nI wonder whether everyone would be better off if they automatically reversed any tempting advice that they heard (except feedback directed at them personally). Whenever they read an inspirational figure saying “take more risks”, they interpret it as “I seem to be looking for advice telling me to take more risks; that fact itself means I am probably risk-seeking and need to be more careful”. Whenever they read someone telling them about the obesity crisis, they interpret it as “I seem to be in a very health-conscious community; maybe I should worry about my weight less.”\n\nProbably this wouldn’t literally work as written. Too much advice is applicable to everybody; the absence of advice to play more Russian roulette is directly linked to Russian roulette being a really bad idea for pretty much everyone.\n\nBut advice reversal might at least be worth considering . The checklist could be something like:\n\n1. Are there plausibly near-equal groups of people who need this advice versus the opposite advice?\n\n2. Have you self-selected into the group of people receiving this advice by, for example, being a fan of the blog / magazine / TV channel / political party / self-help-movement offering it?\n\n3. Then maybe the opposite advice, for you in particular, is at least as worthy of consideration.\n\nThis entry was posted in Uncategorized and tagged rationality .

stops","link":"https://jzhao.xyz/posts/nothing-stops","content":"It was so heavy-handed and so stupid, hitting the nail on the head so hard that it rang like a bell. Nothing stops. – Helena Fitzgerald on Substack\n\nNone of it. The good times, nor the bad. There is no “until this is over”, or “when I’m done this.” There is no “when I get less busy” or “after this term.” Nothing stops.\n\nThere is one Annie Dillard quote I hold central to my ‘consciousness cannon’,\n\nHow we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.\n\nWhat we do with this hour and that one is what we are doing. What can you do to make your hours, days, and life meaningful? Certainly not toiling away for the next few years on things that pain you and question your sanity. Pain is not the unit of effort that matters . Time is.\n\nTake the time to find yourself. Take the time to smell the proverbial flowers. Take a break to sharpen your saw for it will not delay you from cutting more wood.\n\nThere is no permanence to this universe. If we could stop time, we would. Bill Waterson once said that ‘If people could put rainbows in zoos, they’d do it’. Everything we build is a sand castle waiting to be washed away at high tide. Yet, I think that’s what gives life its beauty.\n\nWhat gives life meaning is its scarcity. If one could live forever and do everything they could ever want, why wouldn’t they choose it ? We value the time of others because we know that is finite. Life has meaning because it is finite.\n\nLove then, is knowingly choosing the losing side. What is love but the constant battle against entropy that drives everything apart and strips it of its salience? Loving one another is always the process of deluding ourselves into believing in a better world. What greater project is there, in an unbearable time, in a perpetual future, where nothing stops? In a society that never stops, isn’t loving the ultimate form of protest? To be able to be whole in your existence, to share your time on this little piece of rock drifting through space together?\n\nCompanionship is valuable because it affords the opportunity to feel ‘seen’ by another. We can only, according to Nathaniel Braden, view ourselves conceptually but we need others to view ourselves perceptually. Other consciousnesses function like a mirror – being seen in this way is recognition of personhood. The feeling of being seen is psychological visibility. Love then, is witness through it all.\n\nWitness is deep attention . To witness is not to tether or to pop their balloon, but to hold their strings carefully. adrienne maree brown described relationships like a spiderweb—diaphanous yet strong, thick yet porous. “A web allows things to fall through, like a sieve,” she said. “Some things are not meant to be caught.” David Whyte believed that the ultimate touchstone of a relationship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self.\n\n“The ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone, and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them, and to have believed in them, and sometimes, just to have accompanied them, for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone” – David Whyte\n\nNothing stops isn’t a statement about how nothing matters. Rather, it is a call to spent time on what does matter. As Patti Smith said when discussing William Blake and her creative influences, “Who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them, hold on to them, and visit them often.”\n\nIn the lifespan of the universe, how lucky are we to share our lives together?","tokenFrequency":{"ultim":3,"busy”":1,"life":4,"nathaniel":1,"adrienn":1,"finit":2,"allow":1,"tide":1,"substack":1,"dillard":1,"accompani":1,"recognit":1,"braden":1,"yet":3,"saniti":1,"brown":1,"self":1,"live":3,"choos":2,"hard":1,"web":1,"lifespan":1,"anni":1,"david":2,"entropi":1,"“when":2,"pain":2,"spend":2,"sight":1,"futur":1,"central":1,"statement":1,"attent":1,"alone”":1,"patti":1,"hour":2,"space":1,"matter":3,"this”":1,"lose":1,"cut":1,"wash":1,"would":1,"valuabl":1,"said":3,"certain":1,"high":1,"valu":1,"idea":1,"univers":2,"relationship":2,"journey":1,"spirit":1,"noth":5,"drive":1,"describ":1,"they'd":1,"wait":1,"meant":1,"none":1,"perman":1,"conceptu":1,"“after":1,"view":2,"walk":1,"world":1,"delud":1,"strip":1,"protest":1,"smell":1,"“a":1,"give":2,"care":1,"essenc":1,"need":1,"head":1,"cannon":1,"that":1,"could":4,"time":9,"mirror":1,"sometim":1,"next":1,"want":1,"balloon":1,"flower":1,"greater":1,"sharpen":1,"if":1,"visit":1,"rock":1,"call":1,"i'm":1,"“the":1,"peopl":2,"it":1,"over”":1,"accomplish":1,"fitzgerald":1,"cours":1,"nail":1,"togeth":2,"break":1,"feel":2,"wood":1,"howev":1,"rainbow":1,"visibl":1,"tether":1,"often”":1,"rang":1,"beauti":1,"zoo":1,"isn't":2,"make":1,"build":1,"better":1,"whyte":2,"mean":2,"fall":1,"equal":1,"blake":1,"sand":1,"societi":1,"hold":3,"battl":1,"stop":6,"wit":4,"meaning":1,"get":1,"rather":1,"littl":1,"brief":1,"accord":1,"forev":1,"whole":1,"seen":4,"hit":1,"thick":1,"exist":1,"grant":1,"form":1,"caught”":1,"term”":1,"psycholog":1,"put":1,"process":1,"done":1,"ever":1,"wouldn't":1,"bad":1,"waterson":1,"find":2,"span":1,"perceptu":1,"project":1,"one":4,"deep":1,"“some":1,"constant":1,"delay":1,"perpetu":1,"influenc":1,"love":5,"stupid":1,"magnifi":1,"salienc":1,"unit":1,"opportun":1,"everyth":3,"piec":1,"“until":1,"spiderweb—diaphan":1,"function":1,"imposs":1,"like":4,"believ":3,"drift":1,"personhood":1,"neither":1,"“who":1,"abl":1,"scarciti":1,"strong":1,"helena":1,"discuss":1,"":16,"lucki":1,"privileg":2,"porous":1,"share":2,"day":2,"smith":1,"anoth":3,"toil":1,"alway":1,"heavyhand":1,"creativ":1,"away":2,"take":3,"mare":1,"sieve”":1,"–":3,"apart":1,"good":1,"think":1,"thing":3,"touchston":2,"conscious":2,"effort":1,"companionship":1,"pop":1,"book":1,"bell":1,"string":1,"side":1,"way":1,"question":1,"william":1,"bill":1,"quot":1,"someon":1,"improv":1,"year":1,"afford":1,"other":2,"know":2,"never":1,"less":1,"unbear":1,"proverbi":1,"spent":1,"saw":1,"castl":1}},"20141":{"id":"20141","title":"effort - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/effort?s=r","content":"effort\n\nPeople like to say that lives on social media look unattainable and perfect, but whenever I see something that’s beautifully curated all I can see is the sweat: the money expended, the surgery and fillers, the workouts, the interior designers, the carefully selected objects, the hours spent setting up and filming and taking photos. I think the effort is what’s most interesting. I like people who try very hard, and I like people who attempt to conceal their effort, but I especially like people who let all their effort show. We are all Frankenstein monsters—patchwork quilts of past experiences—trying to pass ourselves off as whole and cohesive things. Femininity in society is especially like that: how you dress, how you style your hair, how you apply makeup, how you eat, what jewelry you choose. These are learned things, earned things.\n\nHere’s what I know: if someone’s much better than you at something, they probably try much harder. You probably underestimate how much harder they try. I’m not saying that talent isn’t a meaningful differentiator, because it certainly is, but I think people generally underestimate how effort needs to be poured into talent in order to develop it. So much of getting good at anything is just pure labor: figuring out how to try and then offering up the hours. If you’re doing it wrong you can do it a thousand times and not produce any particularly interesting results. So you have to make sure you’re trying the right way.\n\nBut this post isn’t about how to get good at things. It’s about how people always assume I’m interested in the end result—the wonderful thing they’ve made—when what I’m really interested in is the process. How did you get this way and why? I’m curious about the ugliness of trying, the years and years of wanting and hoping and working. I don’t know why I’m so fascinated by craft. I think it’s because it requires such a sustained tenacity. Like Michelangelo saying that he just chips away at everything that didn’t look like David: a hundred thousand little motions to reveal the underlying beauty.\n\nI think a lot of people want to be but they don’t want to do. They want to have written a book, but they don’t want to write the book. They want to be fit, but they don’t want the tedium of working out. They’re ashamed of rejection and they’re ashamed of imperfection. I might want lots of people to subscribe to this Substack, but do I want to workshop a post every day? Donna Tartt once said in an interview that if the writer’s not having fun the reader isn’t either. I think people make the best things when they love the process, when they willingly shoulder the inherent uncertainty and pain that comes with it. It’s almost like a form of prayer: you offer up what you can even though the reward is uncertain. You do it out of love.\n\nFantasy is easy and effort is punishing. Seeming is always easier than being. But what kind of life are we living if we’re not honest with ourselves? My friend once told me that there are two types of people: people who are ashamed of something and choose not to do it, and people who choose to do it anyway and just hide it. I wanted to never be the latter: someone who cares more about appearances than they care about their relationship with themselves. I don’t want to pretend like I’m too good for ugliness, for effort, when I know very well that it’s the price that unlocks everything beautiful in the world.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

I don't believe in \"one size fits all\" solutions, but we don't need to start from a blank slate either. [My book](https://leanpub.com/patterns-for-decentralised-organising/) is a collection of \"patterns\", experiences that are common in all collaborative groups. Each pattern names a common *dysfunction* (e.g. unfair distribution of care labour), and a *response* (e.g. account for care work the same way you treat other work). My approach to organisational development: 1. 🏠 understand the **local context** for this org: history, relationships, intentions, strengths, obstacles, etc. 2. 🌏 zoom out to a **global view** to find an appropriate frame of reference (e.g. #agile, #teal, #sociocracy, #coops, #designthinking, #artofhosting) 3. 🔎 zoom in to an ***adjacent* local context** (i.e. another organisation that shares something in common with this one) 4. 🏡 **return home** with lessons to inform the next experiment we'll try So the \"handbooks\" listed here are examples of *local* context (with much gratitude to the authors who make their experience transparent for others to learn from). The \"toolkits and books\" are *global* lessons extracted from local experience. ---- ### Contributors [@richdecibels](https://twitter.com/RichDecibels) [@patconnolly](https://twitter.com/patconnolly)

Peter Thiel’s Palantir Helped the NSA Spy on the World","link":"https://theintercept.com/2017/02/22/how-peter-thiels-palantir-helped-the-nsa-spy-on-the-whole-world","content":"Illustration: Erik Carter for The Intercept Illustration: Erik Carter for The Intercept\n\nHow Peter Thiel’s Palantir Helped the NSA Spy on the Whole World Documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden reveal Palantir’s role in creating the U.S. government’s international spy machine.\n\nIllustration: Erik Carter for The Intercept Illustration: Erik Carter for The Intercept\n\nDonald Trump has inherited the most powerful machine for spying ever devised. How this petty, vengeful man might wield and expand the sprawling American spy apparatus, already vulnerable to abuse, is disturbing enough on its own. But the outlook is even worse considering Trump’s vast preference for private sector expertise and new strategic friendship with Silicon Valley billionaire investor Peter Thiel, whose controversial (and opaque) company Palantir has long sought to sell governments an unmatched power to sift and exploit information of any kind. Thiel represents a perfect nexus of government clout with the kind of corporate swagger Trump loves. The Intercept can now reveal that Palantir has worked for years to boost the global dragnet of the NSA and its international partners, and was in fact co-created with American spies.\n\nPeter Thiel became one of the American political mainstream’s most notorious figures in 2016 (when it emerged he was bankrolling a lawsuit against Gawker Media, my former employer) even before he won a direct line to the White House. Now he brings to his role as presidential adviser decades of experience as kingly investor and token nonliberal on Facebook’s board of directors, a Rolodex of software luminaries, and a decidedly Trumpian devotion to controversy and contrarianism. But perhaps the most appealing asset Thiel can offer our bewildered new president will be Palantir Technologies, which Thiel founded with Alex Karp and Joe Lonsdale in 2004.\n\nPalantir has never masked its ambitions, in particular the desire to sell its services to the U.S. government — the CIA itself was an early investor in the startup through In-Q-Tel, the agency’s venture capital branch. But Palantir refuses to discuss or even name its government clientele, despite landing “at least $1.2 billion” in federal contracts since 2009, according to an August 2016 report in Politico . The company was last valued at $20 billion and is expected to pursue an IPO in the near future. In a 2012 interview with TechCrunch, while boasting of ties to the intelligence community, Karp said nondisclosure contracts prevent him from speaking about Palantir’s government work.\n\n“Palantir” is generally used interchangeably to refer to both Thiel and Karp’s company and the software that company creates. Its two main products are Palantir Gotham and Palantir Metropolis, more geeky winks from a company whose Tolkien namesake is a type of magical sphere used by the evil lord Sauron to surveil, trick, and threaten his enemies across Middle Earth. While Palantir Metropolis is pegged to quantitative analysis for Wall Street banks and hedge funds, Gotham (formerly Palantir Government) is designed for the needs of intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security customers. Gotham works by importing large reams of “structured” data (like spreadsheets) and “unstructured” data (like images) into one centralized database, where all of the information can be visualized and analyzed in one workspace. For example, a 2010 demo showed how Palantir Government could be used to chart the flow of weapons throughout the Middle East by importing disparate data sources like equipment lot numbers, manufacturer data, and the locations of Hezbollah training camps. Palantir’s chief appeal is that it’s not designed to do any single thing in particular, but is flexible and powerful enough to accommodate the requirements of any organization that needs to process large amounts of both personal and abstract data.\n\nDespite all the grandstanding about lucrative, shadowy government contracts, co-founder Karp does not shy away from taking a stand in the debate over government surveillance. In a Forbes profile in 2013, he played privacy lamb, saying, “I didn’t sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair. … We have to find places that we protect away from government so that we can all be the unique and interesting and, in my case, somewhat deviant people we’d like to be.” In that same article, Thiel lays out Palantir’s mission with privacy in mind: to “reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties.” After the first wave of revelations spurred by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, Palantir was quick to deny that it had any connection to the NSA spy program known as PRISM, which shared an unfortunate code name with one of its own software products. The current iteration of Palantir’s website includes an entire section dedicated to “Privacy \u0026 Civil Liberties,” proclaiming the company’s support of both:\n\nPalantir Technologies is a mission-driven company, and a core component of that mission is protecting our fundamental rights to privacy and civil liberties. …\n\nSome argue that society must “balance” freedom and safety, and that in order to better protect ourselves from those who would do us harm, we have to give up some of our liberties. We believe that this is a false choice in many areas. Particularly in the world of data analysis, liberty does not have to be sacrificed to enhance security. Palantir is constantly looking for ways to protect privacy and individual liberty through its technology while enabling the powerful analysis necessary to generate the actionable intelligence that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies need to fulfill their missions.\n\nIt’s hard to square this purported commitment to privacy with proof, garnered from documents provided by Edward Snowden, that Palantir has helped expand and accelerate the NSA’s global spy network, which is jointly administered with allied foreign agencies around the world. Notably, the partnership has included building software specifically to facilitate, augment, and accelerate the use of XKEYSCORE, one of the most expansive and potentially intrusive tools in the NSA’s arsenal. According to Snowden documents published by The Guardian in 2013, XKEYSCORE is by the NSA’s own admission its “widest reaching” program, capturing “nearly everything a typical user does on the internet.” A subsequent report by The Intercept showed that XKEYSCORE’s “collected communications not only include emails, chats, and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions, and more.” For the NSA and its global partners, XKEYSCORE makes all of this as searchable as a hotel reservation site.\n\nBut how do you make so much data comprehensible for human spies? As the additional documents published with this article demonstrate, Palantir sold its services to make one of the most powerful surveillance systems ever devised even more powerful, bringing clarity and slick visuals to an ocean of surveillance data.\n\nPalantir’s relationship with government spy agencies appears to date back to at least 2008, when representatives from the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, joined their American peers at VisWeek, an annual data visualization and computing conference organized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. Attendees from throughout government and academia gather to network with members of the private sector at the event, where they compete in teams to solve hypothetical data-based puzzles as part of the Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST) Challenge. As described in a document saved by GCHQ, Palantir fielded a team in 2008 and tackled one such scenario using its own software. It was a powerful marketing opportunity at a conference filled with potential buyers.\n\nIn the demo, Palantir engineers showed how their software could be used to identify Wikipedia users who belonged to a fictional radical religious sect and graph their social relationships. In Palantir’s pitch, its approach to the VAST Challenge involved using software to enable “many analysts working together [to] truly leverage their collective mind.” The fake scenario’s target, a cartoonishly sinister religious sect called “the Paraiso Movement,” was suspected of a terrorist bombing, but the unmentioned and obvious subtext of the experiment was the fact that such techniques could be applied to de-anonymize and track members of any political or ideological group. Among a litany of other conclusions, Palantir determined the group was prone to violence because its “Manifesto’s intellectual influences include ‘Pancho Villa, Che Guevara, Leon Trotsky, [and] Cuban revolutionary Jose Martí,’ a list of military commanders and revolutionaries with a history of violent actions.”\n\nThe delegation from GCHQ returned from VisWeek excited and impressed. In a classified report from those who attended, Palantir’s potential for aiding the spy agency was described in breathless terms. “Palantir are a relatively new Silicon Valley startup who are sponsored by the CIA,” the report began. “They claim to have significant involvement with the US intelligence community, although none yet at NSA.” GCHQ noted that Palantir “has been developed closely internally with intelligence community users (unspecified, but likely to be the CIA given the funding).” The report described Palantir’s demo as “so significant” that it warranted its own entry in GCHQ’s classified internal wiki, calling the software “extremely sophisticated and mature. … We were very impressed. You need to see it to believe it.”\n\nThe report conceded, however, that “it would take an enormous effort for an in-house developed GCHQ system to get to the same level of sophistication” as Palantir. The GCHQ briefers also expressed hesitation over the price tag, noting that “adoption would have [a] huge monetary … cost,” and over the implications of essentially outsourcing intelligence analysis software to the private sector, thus making the agency “utterly dependent on a commercial product.” Finally, the report added that “it is possible there may be concerns over security — the company have published a lot of information on their website about how their product is used in intelligence analysis, some of which we feel very uncomfortable about.”\n\nHowever anxious British intelligence was about Palantir’s self-promotion, the worry must not have lasted very long. Within two years, documents show that at least three members of the “Five Eyes” spy alliance between the United States, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada were employing Palantir to help gather and process data from around the world. Palantir excels at making connections between enormous, separate databases, pulling big buckets of information (call records, IP addresses, financial transactions, names, conversations, travel records) into one centralized heap and visualizing them coherently, thus solving one of the persistent problems of modern intelligence gathering: data overload.\n\nA GCHQ wiki page titled “Visualisation,” outlining different ways “to provide insight into some set of data,” puts succinctly Palantir’s intelligence value:\n\nPalantir is an information management platform for analysis developed by Palantir Technologies. It integrates structured and unstructured data, provides search and discovery capabilities, knowledge management, and collaborative features. The goal is to offer the infrastructure, or ‘full stack,’ that intelligence organizations require for analysis.\n\nUnder the Five Eyes arrangement, member countries collect and pool enormous streams of data and metadata collected through tools like XKEYSCORE, amounting to tens of billions of records. The alliance is constantly devising (or attempting) new, experimental methods of prying data out of closed and private sources, including by hacking into computers and networks in non-Five Eyes countries and infecting them with malware.\n\nA 2011 PowerPoint presentation from GCHQ’s Network Defence Intelligence \u0026 Security Team (NDIST) — which, as The Intercept has previously reported, “worked to subvert anti-virus and other security software in order to track users and infiltrate networks” — mentioned Palantir as a tool for processing data gathered in the course of its malware-oriented work. Palantir’s software was described as an “analyst workspace [for] pulling together disparate information and displaying it in novel ways,” and was used closely in conjunction with other intelligence software tools, like the NSA’s notorious XKEYSCORE search system. The novel ways of using Palantir for spying seemed open-ended, even imaginative: A 2010 presentation on the joint NSA-GCHQ “Mastering the Internet” surveillance program mentioned the prospect of running Palantir software on “Android handsets” as part of a SIGINT-based “augmented reality” experience. It’s unclear what exactly this means or could even look like.\n\nAbove all, these documents depict Palantir’s software as a sort of consolidating agent, allowing Five Eyes analysts to make sense of tremendous amounts of data that might have been otherwise unintelligible or highly time-consuming to digest. In a 2011 presentation to the NSA, classified top secret, an NDIST operative noted the “good collection” of personal data among the Five Eyes alliance but lamented the “poor analytics,” and described the attempt to find new tools for SIGINT analysis, in which it “conducted a review of 14 different systems that might work.” The review considered services from Lockheed Martin and Detica (a subsidiary of BAE Systems) but decided on the up-and-comer from Palo Alto.\n\nPalantir is described as having been funded not only by In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital branch, but furthermore created “through [an] iterative collaboration between Palantir computer scientists and analysts from various intelligence agencies over the course of nearly three years.” While it’s long been known that Palantir got on its feet with the intelligence community’s money, it has not been previously reported that the intelligence community actually helped build the software. The continuous praise seen in these documents shows that the collaboration paid off. Under the new “Palantir Model,” “data can come from anywhere” and can be “asked whatever the analyst wants.”\n\nAlong with Palantir’s ability to pull in “direct XKS Results,” the presentation boasted that the software was already connected to 10 other secret Five Eyes and GCHQ programs and was highly popular among analysts. It even offered testimonials (TWO FACE appears to be a code name for the implementation of Palantir):\n\n[Palantir] is the best tool I have ever worked with. It’s intuitive, i.e. idiot-proof, and can do a lot you never even dreamt of doing.\n\nThis morning, using TWO FACE rather than XKS to review the activity of the last 3 days. It reduced the initial analysis time by at least 50%.\n\nEnthusiasm runs throughout the PowerPoint: A slide titled “Unexpected Benefits” reads like a marketing brochure, exclaiming that Palantir “interacts with anything!” including Google Earth, and “You can even use it on a iphone or laptop.” The next slide, on “Potential Downsides,” is really more praise in disguise: Palantir “Looks expensive” but “isn’t as expensive as expected.” The answer to “What can’t it do?” is revealing: “However we ask, Palantir answer,” indicating that the collaboration between spies and startup didn’t end with Palantir’s CIA-funded origins, but that the company was willing to create new features for the intelligence community by request.\n\nOn GCHQ’s internal wiki page for TWO FACE, analysts were offered a “how to” guide for incorporating Palantir into their daily routine, covering introductory topics like “How do I … Get Data from XKS in Palantir,” “How do I … Run a bulk search,” and “How do I … Run bulk operations over my objects in Palantir.” For anyone in need of a hand, “training is currently offered as 1-2-1 desk based training with a Palantir trainer. This gives you the opportunity to quickly apply Palantir to your current work task.” Palantir often sends “forward deployed engineers,” or FDEs, to work alongside clients at their offices and provide assistance and engineering services, though the typical client does not have access to the world’s largest troves of personal information. For analysts interested in tinkering with Palantir, there was even a dedicated instant message chat room open to anyone for “informally” discussing the software.\n\nThe GCHQ wiki includes links to classified webpages describing Palantir’s use by the Australian Defence Signals Directorate (now called the Australian Signals Directorate) and to a Palantir entry on the NSA’s internal “Intellipedia,” though The Intercept does not have access to copies of the linked sites. However, embedded within Intellipedia HTML files available to The Intercept are references to a variety of NSA-Palantir programs, including “Palantir Classification Helper,” “[Target Knowledge Base] to Palantir PXML,” and “PalantirAuthService.” (Internal Palantir documents obtained by TechCrunch in 2013 provide additional confirmation of the NSA’s relationship with the company.)\n\nOne Palantir program used by GCHQ, a software plug-in named “Kite,” was preserved almost in its entirety among documents provided to The Intercept. An analysis of Kite’s source code shows just how much flexibility the company afforded Five Eyes spies. Developers and analysts could ingest data locally using either Palantir’s “Workspace” application or Kite. When they were satisfied the process was working properly, they could push it into a Palantir data repository where other Workspace users could also access it, almost akin to a Google Spreadsheets collaboration. When analysts were at their Palantir workstation, they could perform simple imports of static data, but when they wanted to perform more complicated tasks like import databases or set up recurring automatic imports, they turned to Kite.\n\nKite worked by importing intelligence data and converting it into an XML file that could be loaded into a Palantir data repository. Out of the box, Kite was able to handle a variety of types of data (including dates, images, geolocations, etc.), but GCHQ was free to extend it by writing custom fields for complicated types of data the agency might need to analyze. The import tools were designed to handle a variety of use cases, including static data sets, databases that were updated frequently, and data stores controlled by third parties to which GCHQ was able to gain access.\n\nThis collaborative environment also produced a piece of software called “XKEYSCORE Helper,” a tool programmed with Palantir (and thoroughly stamped with its logo) that allowed analysts to essentially import data from the NSA’s pipeline, investigate and visualize it through Palantir, and then presumably pass it to fellow analysts or Five Eyes intelligence partners. One of XKEYSCORE’s only apparent failings is that it’s so incredibly powerful, so effective at vacuuming personal metadata from the entire internet, that the volume of information it extracts can be overwhelming. Imagine trying to search your Gmail account, only the results are pulled from every Gmail inbox in the world.\n\nMaking XKEYSCORE more intelligible — and thus much more effective — appears to have been one of Palantir’s chief successes. The helper tool, documented in a GCHQ PDF guide, provided a means of transferring data captured by the NSA’s XKEYSCORE directly into Palantir, where presumably it would be far easier to analyze for, say, specific people and places. An analyst using XKEYSCORE could pull every IP address in Moscow and Tehran that visited a given website or made a Skype call at 14:15 Eastern Time, for example, and then import the resulting data set into Palantir in order to identify additional connections between the addresses or plot their positions using Google Earth.\n\nPalantir was also used as part of a GCHQ project code-named LOVELY HORSE, which sought to improve the agency’s ability to collect so-called open source intelligence — data available on the public internet, like tweets, blog posts, and news articles. Given the “unstructured” nature of this kind of data, Palantir was cited as “an enrichment to existing [LOVELY HORSE] investigations … the content should then be viewable in a human readable format within Palantir.”\n\nPalantir’s impressive data-mining abilities are well-documented, but so too is the potential for misuse. Palantir software is designed to make it easy to sift through piles of information that would be completely inscrutable to a human alone, but the human driving the computer is still responsible for making judgments, good or bad.\n\nA 2011 document by GCHQ’s SIGINT Development Steering Group, a staff committee dedicated to implementing new spy methods, listed some of these worries. In a table listing “risks \u0026 challenges,” the SDSG expressed a “concern that [Palantir] gives the analyst greater potential for going down too many analytical paths which could distract from the intelligence requirement.” What it could mean for analysts to distract themselves by going down extraneous “paths” while browsing the world’s most advanced spy machine is left unsaid. But Palantir’s data-mining abilities were such that the SDSG wondered if its spies should be blocked from having full access right off the bat and suggested configuring Palantir software so that parts would “unlock … based on analysts skill level, hiding buttons and features until needed and capable of utilising.” If Palantir succeeded in fixing the intelligence problem of being overwhelmed with data, it may have created a problem of over-analysis — the company’s software offers such a multitude of ways to visualize and explore massive data sets that analysts could get lost in the funhouse of infographics, rather than simply being overwhelmed by the scale of their task.\n\nIf Palantir’s potential for misuse occurred to the company’s spy clients, surely it must have occurred to Palantir itself, especially given the company’s aforementioned “commitment” to privacy and civil liberties. Sure enough, in 2012 the company announced the formation of the Palantir Council of Advisors on Privacy and Civil Liberties, a committee of academics and consultants with expertise in those fields. Palantir claimed that convening the PCAP had “provided us with invaluable guidance as we try to responsibly navigate the often ill-defined legal, political, technological, and ethical frameworks that sometimes govern the various activities of our customers,” and continued to discuss the privacy and civil liberties “implications of product developments and to suggest potential ways to mitigate any negative effects.” Still, Palantir made clear that the “PCAP is advisory only — any decisions that we make after consulting with the PCAP are entirely our own.”\n\nWhat would a privacy-minded conversation about privacy-breaching software look like? How had a privacy and civil liberties council navigated the fact that Palantir’s clientele had directly engaged in one of the greatest privacy and civil liberties breaches of all time? It’s hard to find an answer.\n\nPalantir wrote that it structured the nondisclosure agreement signed by PCAP members so that they “will be free to discuss anything that they learn in working with us unless we clearly designate information as proprietary or otherwise confidential (something that we have rarely found necessary except on very limited occasions).” But despite this assurance of transparency, all but one of the PCAP’s former and current members either did not return a request for comment for this article or declined to comment citing the NDA.\n\nThe former PCAP member who did respond, Stanford privacy scholar Omer Tene, told The Intercept that he was unaware of “any specific relationship, agreement, or project that you’re referring to,” and said he was not permitted to answer whether Palantir’s work with the intelligence community was ever a source of tension with the PCAP. He declined to comment on either the NSA or GCHQ specifically. “In general,” Tene said, “the role of the PCAP was to hear about client engagement or new products and offerings that the company was about to launch, and to opine as to the way they should be set up or delivered in order to minimize privacy and civil liberties concerns.” But without any further detail, it’s unclear whether the PCAP was ever briefed on the company’s work for spy agencies, or whether such work was a matter of debate.\n\nThere’s little detail to be found on archived versions of Palantir’s privacy and civil liberties-focused blog, which appears to have been deleted sometime after the PCAP was formed. Palantir spokesperson Matt Long told The Intercept to contact the Palantir media team for questions regarding the vanished blog at the same email address used to reach Long in the first place. Palantir did not respond to additional repeated requests for comment and clarification.\n\nA GCHQ spokesperson provided a boilerplate statement reiterating the agency’s “longstanding policy” against commenting on intelligence matters and asserted that all its activities are “carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework.” The NSA did not provide a response.\n\nAnyone worried that the most powerful spy agencies on Earth might use Palantir software to violate the privacy or civil rights of the vast number of people under constant surveillance may derive some cold comfort in a portion of the user agreement language Palantir provided for the Kite plug-in, which stipulates that the user will not violate “any applicable law” or the privacy or the rights “of any third party.” The world will just have to hope Palantir’s most powerful customers follow the rules.\n\nListen to Jeremy Scahill’s interview with Sam Biddle on Episode 4 of Intercepted (begins at 32:05).\n\nWait! Before you go\n\non about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn’t done it? Consider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren’t on the beat? The kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don’t have ads, so we depend on our members — 35,000 and counting — to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn’t need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month. That’s all it takes to support the journalism you rely on.\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

I Became a Techno-Futurist (Kind Of) - by Ross Douthat","link":"https://douthat.substack.com/p/how-i-became-a-techno-futurist-kind","content":"Of the conservative or “post-liberal” responses to our decadent society that I discussed in my last post , there’s a division — sometimes plain, some implicit — between those who are primarily interested in acceleration and those who are interested more in regeneration. The first attitude regards the growth-and-technology machine of the modern world as something that’s stalled out and needs to be restarted; the sclerosis of central governments as something that needs to be shaken off for the sake of a new American century; the collapse of birthrates as an economic and national security challenge as well as a signifier of cultural decline; the constant failure of our meritocratic elite as a sign that we need a new and better leadership class; and so on. This is the Californian-Thielian-nationalist school of right-wing anti-decadence, the “industrial policy and flying cars” school, the school that encompasses Silicon Valley libertarians (and ex-libertarians), Claremont Institute re-founders, Israeli political theorists, and a lot of the essays published in American Affairs .\n\nThe second attitude is more traditionally conservative, more skeptical of technology’s promise and effects, and more convinced that the West has reached not just a decadent lull in its development, but a grim terminus from which the only useful direction is back. The federal government will not save us, Silicon Valley can only draw us deeper into atomization and anomie, going into space will leave us no less existentially adrift, life extension is a dystopian dead end. Our salvation lies in the local and traditional, in a reconnection to place, a return to the natural world and the human scale of things — the family and the parish and the school, and in politics the polis of the neighborhood or town or city, not the overextended empire or the decaying nation-state.\n\nThis is the crunchier and more religious school of anti-decadence — the school of the homeschooling co-op and the classical Christian academy and all manner of traditionalisms, and in the intellectual scene the school of Rod Dreher and Patrick Deneen above all.\n\nThe division between these schools is not a perfect binary by any means. Many of the accelerationists are also religious, heretical in some cases but traditionalist in others, excited to send missionaries into space and plant oratories on the moon. (One of the editors of American Affairs is a noted Catholic integralist , for instance.) And many regenerative conservatives acknowledge the necessity of national policy to the local renaissances they imagine: Here is Deneen himself doing so, in a speech to the National Conservatism Conference that otherwise reads as a mild rebuke of the nationalist form of anti-decadence.\n\nBut where to strike the balance between the two impulses — up or back, dynamist or preservationist, techno-optimist or tech-skeptical — is a crucial question for the right today. And Deneen’s own review of The Decadent Society makes the case that I have struck the balance wrong, that I’m much too hopeful that innovation will somehow save us from a period of corruption that innovation itself has brought upon us, that I need less Peter Thiel and more Henry Adams, less dynamism and more conservatism:\n\nThis diagnosis of decadence as the deceleration of technological progress and the corresponding solution to decadence as reacceleration bookends Douthat’s book, but it’s the constant presence of Adamsian doubts that generates tensions between Douthat’s hopes for technology, on the one hand, and skepticism toward progressivism, on the other. Many of his markers of decadence—particularly declining birthrates, institutional sclerosis, cultural repetition, and soft or “kindly” despotism—would be better described through the lens of Adams than Thiel. Douthat’s own analysis of these phenomena often reveals them to be more like forms of decay due to apparent progress than he is often willing to explicitly recognize, leading to a persistent disconnect between claim and conclusion that he seems intent on maintaining.\n\nThus today’s demographic decline, Deneen suggests, is the bitter fruit of a great technological leap forward: The invention of the birth control pill. Today’s political sclerosis reflects the attempts by would-be scientists of politics to rationalize the party system and the Congress, with polarization and stalemate as their consequences. In these and many other cases, we can see a conservative worldview vindicated: The so-called wisdom of men is often a higher foolishness, what seems like progress is often a speedier path to decay and dissolution, and the preservation of human civilization requires much more preservation and transmission, and less future-oriented techno-optimism, than Western society from the dynamo to the iPhone has tended to assume.\n\nSo Deneen writes in gentle disappointment that this theme is not the primary one in The Decadent Society, that I seem to enamored of space flight or some other deus ex machina. He would rather that I joined Adams in championing the Virgin over the dynamo, the cathedral over the Eiffel Tower, the ancient tradition of stewardship over and against the modern faith that capitalist destruction will always somehow be “creative.”\n\nTo a mild extent I think he wrongs me. My book begins and end with the moon landing and visions of a human future beyond the pale blue dot, but I tried to be scrupulous in arguing that there is no single cure for decadence, that certain apparent breakthroughs could themselves become agents of stagnation (as the internet has been, and other forms of technological progress might prove to be), and that if we get a true renaissance it will probably involve art and faith and politics as much as tech, sparks blossoming into flame in many different areas at once. To quote the penultimate chapter:\n\nInstead of a single primary cause — life extension! #fullsocialism! a religious awakening! — driving all the secondary ones, a real renaissance would look more like the birth of the modern world, when the Renaissance and the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation and the scientific revolutions and the age of discovery were happening on top of one another, influencing each other and driving each other forward in ways that historians have been unpacking and repackaging, explaining and reexplaining all at once.\n\nBut this passage also makes clear that I am a dynamist of sorts in The Decadent Society, rooting for technological progress in a way that’s at odds with the traditionalism embodied by many writers, especially Catholic writers, that I generally admire. And this does reflect something of a change in attitude for me. I came to my conservatism through J.R.R. Tolkien and G.K. Chesterton, not Julian Simon or Ayn Rand, and if you had asked me about my attitude toward science and technology and the mastery of nature back when I was a young reactionary, I would have probably taken a version of the Ian-Malcolmian view from Jurassic Park, worrying more about the hubris of scientists and the dehumanizing aspects of modern tech than the perils of not having enough progress, enough churn and flux and change.\n\nToday I’m still a traditionalist in my doubts about moral progress, and still a Malcolmian skeptic in my attitudes toward certain specific forms of tech. For instance, I think the battle to master the internet, to rule information technology rather than letting it rule us, is crucial to human flourishing, and it’s not a battle we’re winning at the moment. And I’m definitely a skeptic of a triumphalist scientism, in the new- atheist or Neil DeGrasse Tyson molds.\n\nBut even if I don’t f—-ing love science, as the memes have it, I nonetheless regard the age of the dynamo a little differently than Henry Adams did. “Writing against the spirit of the age,” Deneen writes, Adams “sought to redirect our wonder. When asked which figure inspired greater devotion, awe, and sacrifice—the Virgin or the Electric Goddess of Progress—Adams had no doubt. Human civilization had declined.”\n\nMaybe — but in the light of hindsight we can see that at the time of the 1900 World’s Fair, Western Christianity was in many respects more culturally powerful and institutionally resilient, not just than it would be one hundred years later, but than it had been one hundred years earlier, in the time of Adams’ most famous ancestor. That is to say, the 19th century, the age of industrial progress and scientific ferment, the age of the steamship and railroad and so many famous encounters with the technological sublime , was also a period of revival and mobilization for Christian churches on a scale that few people in the much-less pious year of 1800 could have possibly foreseen. The years of England’s industrial revolution was also an era of evangelical and Anglo-Catholic revival; the France that raised the Eiffel Tower also raised the the Sacre-Coeur ; the century of the steam engine was also the century of the Immaculate Conception. Given the chance to choose between the Dynamo and the Virgin, 19th century Europe appeared to actually choose both.\n\n(As, in their way, did medieval Christians, since the High Middle Ages would not have been so high without their own rush of scientific progress .)\n\nI was struck by something similar when I was writing about the post-World War II Christian revival in the United States for my now-decade-old book Bad Religion . In defending that revival against critics who deemed it just a superficial or consumerist form of religious faith, I couldn’t help noticing that it coincided with a period of intense technical and scientific optimism, however complicated by atomic-age anxieties. The last major Christian revival in the Western world, in other words, literally happened in the (brief, truncated) Space Age.\n\nThen the subsequent divisions and decline of institutional Christianity, the main subject of Bad Religion, began around the same time, near the same inflection point, as the deceleration of Western economic growth and the stagnation in technological progress that accelerationists now aspire to see reversed. And the capital-S Science that endured, thereafter, in our more secularized era — a Science invoked like a talisman against religious conservatives in moral controversies, even as it increasingly fails to generate the kind of reliable results promised by its cultural mystique — increasingly feels like something out of the stagnant world of Aldous Huxley:\n\n“Yes,” Mustapha Mond was saying, “that’s another item in the cost of stability. It isn’t only art that’s incompatible with happiness; it’s also science. Science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.”\n\n“What?” said Helmholtz, in astonishment. “But we’re always saying that science is everything. It’s a hypnopaedic platitude.”\n\n“Three times a week between thirteen and seventeen,” put in Bernard.\n\n“And all the science propaganda we do at the College …”\n\n“Yes; but what sort of science?” asked Mustapha Mond sarcastically. “You’ve had no scientific training, so you can’t judge. I was a pretty good physicist in my time. Too good—good enough to realize that all our science is just a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody’s allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn’t be added to except by special permission from the head cook. I’m the head cook now. But I was an inquisitive young scullion once. I started doing a bit of cooking on my own. Unorthodox cooking, illicit cooking. A bit of real science, in fact.” He was silent.\n\nWhich pointed me toward the tentative hypothesis that informs The Decadent Society’s take on science and religion — that for all their vast differences they also have certain important things in common that can cause them to effectively move together, scientific curiosity with theological speculation, technical innovation with communal fervor, the laboratory buzzing while the pews are packed nearby. From the same chapter quoted above:\n\n… scientific and religious experiments proceed from a similar desire for knowing, a similar belief that the universe is patterned and intelligible and that its secrets might somehow be unlocked. Which is why in periods of real intellectual ferment and development, there is often a general surge of experimentation that extends across multiple ways of seeking knowledge, from the scientific and experimental, to the theological and mystical, to the gray zones and disputed territories in between.\n\nThus, the assumption, common to rationalists today, that religion represents a form of unreason that science has to vanquish on its way to new ages of discovery, is as mistaken as the religious reflex that regards the scientific mind-set as an inevitable threat to the pious simplicities of faith … As much as the relationship between science and religion can be adversarial, there can also be a mysterious alchemy between the two forms of human exploration. And nothing will be a surer sign that decadence has ended in something like a renaissance than if that alchemy suddenly returns.\n\nAgain, this does not imply that religious people should be thoughtless Whigs welcoming every new technology as a simple beneficence, or that they should suspend their moral judgment when considerings its application. Nor is there any reason to assume that when religious impulses intertwine with scientific ambitions the religious sentiments will always be benign or kindly ones; it is perfectly possible to imagine some kind of occult transhumanism intertwining with a cruel technological prometheanism, as happened in one of the West’s most powerful countries not so long ago. There might be dark technological scenarios ahead of us where Christians and conservatives will be obliged to be simple Luddites, or even leaders of a Butlerian Jihad .\n\nBut by the same token, there are also scenarios for Christian or conservative renewal that would depend on modern scientific breakthroughs, that indeed would be impossible without them. Deneen invokes the birth control pill as an example of how a technological advance yielded a demographic decline; I think the history of the demographic transitions suggests a somewhat stronger role for culture (e.g. the specific ‘60s timing of the pill’s arrival mattered as much as the contraceptive tech itself), but the basic point still holds. And yet: In exactly the same decade, modern science also delivered the Green Revolution, which made a new world where it was suddenly far easier for people (Catholics, Christians, anyone) to have large families without worrying about either a private or national version of the Malthusian trap.\n\nSo if John Rock’s pill prevented many millions of human beings from being conceived and born, Norman Borlaug’s crops enabled many other millions to live and thrive and grow. And in a world of eight billion people, there is no way for conservatives to imagine demographic decadence giving way to large families and youthful populations once again without yet more Borlaug-style innovation, agro-science, supercrops, vertical farms, the works. (Or, alternatively, without a lot of transports headed for the off-world colonies.)\n\nThis puts a certain limit, I think on conservative pastoralism. Just as there is wisdom in Henry Adams there is wisdom in Wendell Berry, and in the pastoralist tradition writ large. But I don’t see a Wendell Berry option, exactly, for the world of twenty or thirty billions — and that’s the future that traditionalists, by their own premises about faith and family and fertility, are obliged to earnestly desire.\n\nHere I suppose I am a Thielian, in the sense that his observation that the Bible begins with a garden but ends in a city seems like one that any Christian imagining a future for a society of billions upon billions is obliged to take to heart. But with the proviso that some of the most beautiful gardens are found inside cities, and just as the gothic revival and the Arts and Crafts movement and the great works of Frederick Law Olmsted came out of an industrial age, so too some future pastoralist or neo-medievalist movement might be entangled with dynamism in other spheres, reactive against its excesses but also dependent upon its benefits.\n\nNow it’s true that if the world as it exists today goes down with a great crash, then all these questions become moot. But if our civilization endures in something like its present form — and it appears that it will at least survive the Covid era — then anyone who seeks its renewal along traditionalist lines must be a dynamist of some sort, must desire scientific progress of some kind, if only because the basic arithmetic of population growth requires it. Not all acceleration is desirable, but there is no regeneration without acceleration of some kind.\n\nOne last point: Since the intellectual is invariably personal, I should note that my own views here have probably been shaped by my family’s recent experience, our own attempted return to a more bucolic, pastoral way of life — and certain disasters that ensued. But that’s a story for a different book .\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Only when I started putting in some extra hours did I get anywhere. About the time I had my epiphany, a growing field of scholarship was more rigorously reaching the same conclusion.

Take intelligence. No accepted measure of innate or basic intelligence, whether IQ or other metrics, reliably predicts that a person will develop extraordinary ability.\n\nIn other words, the IQs of the great would not predict their level of accomplishments, nor would their accomplishments predict their IQs.\n\nStudies of chess masters and highly successful artists, scientists and musicians usually find their IQs to be above average, typically in the 115 to 130 range, where some 14 per cent of the population reside - impressive enough, but hardly as rarefied as their achievements and abilities. The converse - that high IQ does not ensure greatness - holds as well. This was shown in a study of adult graduates of New York City's Hunter College Elementary School, where an admission criterion was an IQ of at least 130 (achieved by a little over 1 per cent of the general population) and the mean IQ was 157 - \"genius\" territory by any scaling of IQ scores, and a level reached by perhaps 1 in 5000 people.\n\nThough the Hunter graduates were successful and reasonably content with their lives, they had not reached the heights of accomplishment, either individually or as a group, that their IQs might have suggested. In the words of study leader Rena Subotnik, a research psychologist formerly at the City University of New York and now with the American Psychological Association: \"There were no superstars, no Pulitzer Prize or MacArthur Award winners, and only one or two familiar names.\"\n\nThe genius these elite students showed in their IQs remained on paper. So what does create genius or extreme talent? Musicians have an old joke about this: How do you get to Carnegie Hall from here? Practise.\n\nA sober look at any field shows that the top performers are rarely more gifted than the also-rans, but they almost invariably outwork them. This doesn't mean that some people aren't more athletic or smarter than others.\n\nThe elite are elite partly because they have some genetic gifts - for learning and hand-eye coordination, for instance - but the very best rise because they take great pains to maximise that gift. Take Stephen Hawking, who likes to dismiss questions about his IQ by saying, \"People who boast about their IQ are losers,\" and was a middling student and achiever until his mid-twenties.\n\nOnly then did he catch fire - and begin working obsessively - while collaborating with fellow physicist Roger Penrose on black-hole theory. Pete Sampras didn't possess more talent than Andre Agassi, but he won 14 grand slams to Agassi's eight because he worked harder and more steadily. And as cellist Yo-Yo Ma once said, the most proficient and renowned musicians are not necessarily those who outshone everyone as youths, but rather those who had \"fire in the belly\". Decade of dedication This has led scholars of elite performance to speak of a 10-year rule: it seems you have to put in at least a decade of focused work to master something and bring greatness within reach.\n\nThis shows starkly in a 1985 study of 120 elite athletes, performers, artists, biochemists and mathematicians led by University of Chicago psychologist Benjamin Bloom, a giant of the field who died in 1999.\n\nEvery single person in the study took at least a decade of hard study or practice to achieve international recognition. Olympic swimmers trained for an average of 15 years before making the team; the best concert pianists took 15 years to earn international recognition.\n\nTop researchers, sculptors and mathematicians put in similar amounts of time. The same even goes for those few who seem born with supreme talent.\n\nMozart was playing the violin at 3 years of age and received expert, focused instruction from the start. He was precocious, writing symphonies at age 7, but he didn't produce the work that made him a giant until his teens. [Photo: Tom Hulce in 'Amadeus']\n\nThe same is true for Tiger Woods. He seems magical on the golf course, but he was swinging a golf club before he could walk, got great instruction and practised constantly from boyhood, and even today outworks all his rivals.\n\nHis genius has been laboriously constructed.\n\n[an error occurred while processing this directive] ~ ~\n\nHow to be a genius By David Dobbs [Pg 1/2] From Albert Einstein to Tiger Woods, if you want to achieve great things, there's a simple recipe for success.

Though the Hunter graduates were successful and reasonably content with their lives, they had not reached the heights of accomplishment, either individually or as a group, that their IQs might have suggested. In the words of study leader Rena Subotnik, a research psychologist formerly at the City University of New York and now with the American Psychological Association: \"There were no superstars, no Pulitzer Prize or MacArthur Award winners, and only one or two familiar names.\" The genius these elite students showed in their IQs remained on paper. So what does create genius or extreme talent? Musicians have an old joke about this: How do you get to Carnegie Hall from here? Practise. A sober look at any field shows that the top performers are rarely more gifted than the also-rans, but they almost invariably outwork them. This doesn't mean that some people aren't more athletic or smarter than others. The elite are elite partly because they have some genetic gifts - for learning and hand-eye coordination, for instance - but the very best rise because they take great pains to maximise that gift. Take Stephen Hawking, who likes to dismiss questions about his IQ by saying, \"People who boast about their IQ are losers,\" and was a middling student and achiever until his mid-twenties. Only then did he catch fire - and begin working obsessively - while collaborating with fellow physicist Roger Penrose on black-hole theory. Pete Sampras didn't possess more talent than Andre Agassi, but he won 14 grand slams to Agassi's eight because he worked harder and more steadily. And as cellist Yo-Yo Ma once said, the most proficient and renowned musicians are not necessarily those who outshone everyone as youths, but rather those who had \"fire in the belly\". Decade of dedication This has led scholars of elite performance to speak of a 10-year rule: it seems you have to put in at least a decade of focused work to master something and bring greatness within reach. This shows starkly in a 1985 study of 120 elite athletes, performers, artists, biochemists and mathematicians led by University of Chicago psychologist Benjamin Bloom, a giant of the field who died in 1999. Every single person in the study took at least a decade of hard study or practice to achieve international recognition. Olympic swimmers trained for an average of 15 years before making the team; the best concert pianists took 15 years to earn international recognition. Top researchers, sculptors and mathematicians put in similar amounts of time. The same even goes for those few who seem born with supreme talent. Mozart was playing the violin at 3 years of age and received expert, focused instruction from the start. He was precocious, writing symphonies at age 7, but he didn't produce the work that made him a giant until his teens. [Photo: Tom Hulce in 'Amadeus'] The same is true for Tiger Woods. He seems magical on the golf course, but he was swinging a golf club before he could walk, got great instruction and practised constantly from boyhood, and even today outworks all his rivals. His genius has been laboriously constructed. \u003e Continued on Page 2 . ~ ~ ~ Related Talent Development Resources pages : High Ability Highly Sensitive Gifted / talented news \u0026 resources Articles: high ability - gifted/talented More giftedness articles Giftedness books HSP \u0026 gifted books Intensity / sensitivity Intensity / sensitivity resources : articles sites books Introversion / shyness .

in Tech Faces a Fundamental Problem - The Atlantic","link":"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/06/tech-computers-are-bigger-problem-diversity/592456","content":"The Problem With Diversity in Computing\n\nTech’s discriminatory culture might never change, no matter how many women and people of color are invited into the room.\n\nWhen Amy Webb broke her ankle, she was forced to hobble around on a walking boot. That inconvenience spawned others: among them, she couldn’t pass through the metal detector at airport TSA PreCheck lines any longer. Instead, she had to use the backscatter machines that produce X-ray images of passengers.\n\nWebb, who is a professor at New York University and the author of The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity, took the inconvenience as a firsthand opportunity to watch how this technology, which uses computational methods to mark possible risks on the body, really works. “I’m looking at the screen,” she says of the image that appeared from her scan, “and my cast, head, and breasts were big blocks of yellow.” While waiting for the ensuing pat-down, she watched a couple of other women go through. Same thing: blocks of yellow across their breasts.\n\nIt was because of underwire bras, she later learned, which the system sometimes can’t distinguish from potential weapons. She’s had other problems with the machines, too, including that her mop of thick, curly hair sometimes confuses them. (My colleague Hannah Giorgis, who also has a lot of curly hair, confirms that she, too, suffers a cranial pat-down every time she goes to the airport.)\n\nWebb’s experience is among the more innocuous consequences of computer systems that don’t anticipate all the types of people who might use them. Computers have started issuing prison sentences , for example.\n\nWebb says her airport experience can be traced back to the fact that “someone like me wasn’t in the room” when the system was designed, or when it was trained on images of human forms, or when it was tested before rollout. That idea echoes a popular suggestion to remedy computers’ ignorance of different sorts of people: Increase the diversity of representation among the people who make these systems, and they will serve the population better.\n\nBut that’s an aspirational hope. Tech-industry diversity is improving, but it’s still pretty terrible. Women, black, and Latinx representation is particularly poor. That makes diversity a necessary but insufficient solution to social equity in computing systems.\n\nFor years, companies and educators in the tech sector have framed diversity as a “ pipeline ” problem. The people with the right educational background get access to the right training, which gets them into the right college, which connects them to the top employers. Fixing the flow of talent into this system, the thinking goes, will produce the workforce that Webb and others are calling for.\n\nAmong them is the Constellations Center for Equity in Computing at Georgia Tech, where I hold faculty positions in the colleges of computing and liberal arts. The center’s goal is to increase access to computer-science education among women and people of color. Among its activities, it has funded and supported computer-science classes in Atlanta public schools, especially in primarily black neighborhoods without prior access to those opportunities.\n\nThose efforts have merit. But their impact might be a drop in the bucket, given the size and composition of the tech industry. At Google, for example , more than 95 percent of technical workers are white or Asian. Adding more black engineers from Atlanta schools to that mix will certainly help push the numbers up incrementally. It will also give more people of color access to the economic opportunities the tech industry offers. But there’s a risk of tokenization; inviting a black man or a curly-haired woman into the room could make a difference in the design of the systems that produced Webb’s experience at airport security. But it probably won’t substantially change the thrust of the tech industry as it currently operates.\n\nEven though she’d like to see more diversity among tech workers, Webb blames educational efforts like those that Constellations is pursuing for the current state of affairs, at least in part. “We’ve had this obsession with STEM education,” she said yesterday during a panel at the Aspen Ideas Festival, co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic. “It’s reached fever pitch, manifested in these programs where every kid has to learn to code.” Webb worries that the drive to make more computer professionals for diversity’s sake might create more problems than it solves. If everyone is focused on the nuts and bolts of making software quickly at scale, where will they learn to design it with equity and care? “Critical thinking is what the computers won’t be able to do,” she said.\n\nWebb points to China as an alternative. There, kindergarten-age students nationwide will begin studying a textbook this year that’s designed to teach students the new basics of knowledge they need to succeed in a computational future. “That’s the foundations of the kind of thinking that will allow them to work in conjunction with AI systems,” she concluded. “While everyone’s fixated on ‘Every kid must code,’ we are risking forgetting that every kid must learn to read and write.”\n\nCharles Isbell, the executive director of Constellations and the incoming dean of computing at Georgia Tech, still sees computing education as a necessary step. “The real question,” he told me, “is: Are we interested in diversity, or are we interested in integration?” The integration of women, people of color, and other underrepresented voices would mean that the behavior of the entire industry would change as a result of their presence in that community. “Diversity is just membership,” Isbell said. “Integration is influence, power, and partnership.”\n\nBut integration is much harder than diversity. Isbell thinks that two separate conditions need to be met in order to accomplish it: “One is that the new folks are both capable and confident. The other is that the old folks are willing.”\n\nKamau Bobb, the global lead for diversity research and strategy at Google and a senior director at Constellations, isn’t so sure the tech industry is willing yet. A lot of people are involved in diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Silicon Valley, and “those people are really committed,” Bobb told me. But their motivation is largely driven by providing access to the existing state of affairs. “They’re compelled by the argument that it just isn’t fair that more people don’t have access to the Google life—the free food and the power and the money,” Bobb said. Their goal is to get more people in the game, not necessarily to change the rules of that game. In this line of thinking, inclusion is first a problem of economic equity; any resulting social or moral benefits would just be gravy.\n\nBut for technical systems to take everyone into account, Isbell contends that representation must shift from an economic imperative to a moral one. “First you make the economic argument, and that’s where the industry is now, mostly,” he said. “Then you make the moral argument. That’s where you want to be. Until you win the second argument, you haven’t won.”\n\nIn Webb’s view, that argument is unlikely to ever gain traction among big, wealthy tech companies. “A moral imperative is unlikely to motivate public companies,” she told me. Bobb agrees—Google’s focus on the “ next billion users ” entails a better understanding of people of color, he said, but only because the company finally understands that they represent an untapped market for advertising.\n\nBut to Webb, that doesn’t mean those companies are hopeless. The problem, she said, is that scale, market share, and speed matter more than anything else. She believes the problems that arise in computational social infrastructure, such as backscatter X-ray devices and facial-recognition systems , are caused by the ferocious competition between these companies. Webb thinks a better approach to solving the social ills in artificial-intelligence systems would come from some kind of federal office or consortium that might encourage collaboration between tech firms; one such project could be revising data sets that don’t fully represent the general public.\n\nFor Webb, the underrepresentation of women, black people, and others is a real problem, but it’s not the fundamental one. “We’re all discriminated against by computing,” she insisted. Computing professionals constitute a “tribe,” separated from the general public not primarily by virtue of their race, gender, or nationality, but by the exclusive culture of computing education and industry. That culture replaces all knowledge and interests with the pursuit of technological solutions at maximum speed. “Anyone who falls outside of that core group of interests are not being represented,” Webb said. If she’s right, then the problem with computing isn’t just that it doesn’t represent a diverse public’s needs. Instead, the problem with computing is computing.","tokenFrequency":{"goe":2,"reach":1,"flow":1,"care":1,"sake":1,"cultur":3,"code":1,"differ":2,"free":1,"suffer":1,"“critic":1,"infrastructur":1,"wait":1,"“anyon":1,"blame":1,"risk":3,"atlant":1,"ever":1,"argument":5,"project":1,"experi":3,"“that":1,"still":2,"fever":1,"competit":1,"could":3,"hannah":1,"fair":1,"“integr":1,"composit":1,"come":1,"told":3,"shift":1,"though":1,"support":1,"teach":1,"rollout":1,"next":1,"particular":1,"“a":1,"public":5,"everyon":3,"line":2,"confirm":1,"school":2,"membership”":1,"that":4,"silicon":1,"capabl":1,"represented”":1,"doesn't":2,"communiti":1,"“and":1,"ankl":1,"condit":1,"think":7,"give":1,"hopeless":1,"confid":1,"georgia":2,"consortium":1,"untap":1,"ami":1,"firsthand":1,"festiv":1,"chang":4,"thing":1,"agrees—googl":1,"focus":2,"breast":2,"even":1,"aspir":1,"primarili":2,"latinx":1,"time":1,"mean":2,"say":2,"use":3,"sometim":2,"man":1,"maximum":1,"collabor":1,"devic":1,"core":1,"”":2,"separ":2,"billion":1,"set":1,"“they'r":1,"underwir":1,"won't":2,"prison":1,"lead":1,"execut":1,"much":1,"state":2,"program":2,"terribl":1,"anyth":1,"econom":4,"instead":2,"larg":1,"screen”":1,"given":1,"“while":1,"take":1,"design":4,"worri":1,"year":2,"other":3,"involv":1,"share":1,"will":1,"art":1,"old":1,"woman":1,"right":4,"trace":1,"dean":1,"forc":1,"artificialintellig":1,"voic":1,"yellow”":1,"“divers":1,"fulli":1,"pretti":1,"race":1,"appear":1,"folk":2,"facialrecognit":1,"connect":1,"top":1,"willing”":1,"better":3,"anticip":1,"benefit":1,"do”":1,"moral":4,"popular":1,"least":1,"step":1,"mix":1,"aspen":2,"influenc":1,"hair":2,"nut":1,"fix":1,"frame":1,"serv":1,"unlik":2,"isbel":4,"wasn't":1,"education”":1,"gain":1,"nationwid":1,"current":2,"room":2,"suggest":1,"food":1,"remedi":1,"nation":1,"view":1,"tech":12,"curlyhair":1,"it":2,"black":5,"result":2,"xray":2,"necessarili":1,"advertis":1,"metal":1,"sure":1,"charl":1,"group":1,"bolt":1,"compani":5,"posit":1,"includ":1,"integr":2,"softwar":1,"comput":19,"produc":3,"must":3,"industri":7,"“":2,"backscatt":2,"bucket":1,"integration”":1,"hold":1,"“we'v":1,"yet":1,"studi":1,"fact":1,"educ":6,"pass":1,"market":2,"ad":1,"bobb":4,"couldn't":1,"institut":1,"rule":1,"confus":1,"prior":1,"offic":1,"system":10,"student":2,"warp":1,"approach":1,"can't":1,"textbook":1,"feder":1,"part":1,"provid":1,"altern":1,"size":1,"exampl":2,"probabl":1,"issu":1,"solv":2,"compel":1,"neighborhood":1,"scale":2,"among":8,"idea":2,"distinguish":1,"money”":1,"insist":1,"sort":1,"author":1,"coupl":1,"go":1,"“those":1,"interest":4,"read":1,"panel":1,"traction":1,"mark":1,"affair":2,"order":1,"final":1,"airport":4,"look":1,"“tribe”":1,"access":6,"start":1,"webb":14,"sentenc":1,"spawn":1,"might":5,"background":1,"entail":1,"obsess":1,"game":2,"help":1,"replac":1,"across":1,"goal":2,"social":4,"professor":1,"talent":1,"valley":1,"one":3,"profession":2,"conclud":1,"increas":2,"technolog":2,"giorgi":1,"especi":1,"see":2,"thrust":1,"technic":2,"user":1,"techindustri":1,"“is":1,"harder":1,"allow":1,"cranial":1,"computing”":1,"":22,"abl":1,"percent":1,"understand":2,"potenti":1,"yellow":1,"manifest":1,"inclus":2,"there":1,"hobbl":1,"“someon":1,"pursu":1,"type":1,"room”":1,"improv":1,"gravi":1,"invit":2,"secur":1,"presenc":1,"constel":4,"activ":1,"everi":4,"inconveni":2,"cur":2,"without":1,"workforc":1,"broke":1,"around":1,"make":7,"contend":1,"divers":12,"knowledg":2,"matter":2,"detector":1,"block":2,"systems”":1,"precheck":1,"titan":1,"point":1,"impact":1,"fall":1,"also":2,"real":2,"research":1,"strategi":1,"problem":10,"fixat":1,"walk":1,"general":2,"china":1,"question”":1,"method":1,"data":1,"95":1,"entir":1,"mostly”":1,"she":2,"pursuit":1,"pitch":1,"tsa":1,"googl":3,"consequ":1,"effort":2,"nine":1,"accomplish":1,"york":1,"underrepres":1,"behavior":1,"white":1,"sector":1,"ignor":1,"caus":1,"companies”":1,"work":2,"succeed":1,"asian":1,"outsid":1,"merit":1,"hope":1,"number":1,"longer":1,"driven":1,"imper":2,"“the":1,"patdown":2,"would":4,"substanti":1,"revis":1,"popul":1,"futur":1,"encourag":1,"discrimin":1,"ensu":1,"engin":1,"partnership”":1,"push":1,"liber":1,"virtu":1,"employ":1,"underrepresent":1,"certain":1,"passeng":1,"weapon":1,"repres":3,"“i'm":1,"imag":3,"later":1,"els":1,"power":2,"computersci":2,"gender":1,"cast":1,"second":1,"echo":1,"yesterday":1,"never":1,"bras":1,"solut":2,"color":5,"mop":1,"account":1,"big":3,"univers":1,"conjunct":1,"opportun":3,"thick":1,"women":6,"two":1,"haven't":1,"speed":2,"realli":2,"basic":1,"watch":2,"forget":1,"win":1,"feroci":1,"human":2,"cohost":1,"“it":1,"bodi":1,"constitut":1,"machin":3,"center":2,"ill":1,"wealthi":1,"kind":2,"won”":1,"mani":1,"colleg":2,"motiv":2,"oper":1,"senior":1,"class":1,"colleagu":1,"write”":1,"faculti":1,"offer":1,"kamau":1,"equiti":5,"stem":1,"director":2,"incom":1,"life—th":1,"represent":3,"don't":3,"poor":1,"committed”":1,"ai":1,"pipelin":1,"want":1,"“first":1,"“then":1,"insuffici":1,"“one":1,"fund":1,"atlanta":2,"exist":1,"peopl":14,"she'd":1,"scan":1,"drop":1,"global":1,"call":1,"worker":2,

And by gaining access to a population with a racial mix far different from China’s, CloudWalk will be better able to train racial biases out of its facial recognition systems—a problem that has beleaguered facial recognition companies around the world and which could give China a vital edge.\n\nThe CloudWalk deal is built on the back of a long-standing relationship between former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s regime, seen by China as an ideological ally, and Beijing. Current President Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn into office in November 2017 after a military coup forced Mugabe to resign after 37 years of increasingly repressive rule. But activists fear that Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s former consigliere, will continue the patterns of his predecessor, especially if his regime is backed up with new security technology.\n\nThe deal between CloudWalk and the Zimbabwean government will not cover just CCTV cameras. According to a report in the Chinese state newspaper Science and Technology Daily , smart financial systems, airport, railway, and bus station security, and a national facial database will all be part of the project. The deal—along with dozens of other cooperation agreements between Harare and Chinese technology and biotech firms—was signed in April. Like every other foreign deal done by a Chinese firm of late, it has been wrapped into China’s increasingly all-encompassing Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe CloudWalk deal is the first Chinese AI project in Africa. Google is opening its first Africa AI research center in Ghana this year, but Eric Olander, founder of the China Africa Project—a podcast and online resource that examines the relationship between China and Africa—noted that many Western companies “aren’t willing to make that step that the Chinese are willing to do. … [The Chinese] are willing to make an investment in a market as volatile as Zimbabwe, where companies from other countries are not.”\n\nIndeed, with massive state and private backing for AI projects—according to a CB Insights report , nearly half of global investment in AI went to Chinese start-ups last year, surpassing the United States for the first time—Chinese companies can afford to take risks. CloudWalk itself was the recipient of a $301 million grant from the Guangzhou municipal government.\n\n“We are concerned about the deal, given how CloudWalk provides facial recognition technologies to the Chinese police,” said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch. “We have previously documented [the Chinese] Ministry of Public Security’s use of AI-enabled technologies for mass surveillance that targets particular social groups, such as ethnic minorities and those who pose political threats to the government.”\n\nSome Zimbabweans are concerned about how their data will fare in China. Andy, who asked that only his first name be used, is studying for a Ph.D. at Beijing Normal University. For him, “the question is what the Chinese company will do with our identities. … It sounds like a spy game.” He also says that he “know[s] for a fact” that “the Zimbabwe government will use this tech to try and control people’s freedom.”\n\nIn Zimbabwe, freedom of expression has long been curtailed or monitored by various means. In 2015, Mugabe accepted a gift of cybersurveillance software from the Iranian government, including IMSI catchers, which are used to eavesdrop on telephone conversations. In 2016, he cited China as an example of social media regulation that he hoped Zimbabwe could emulate.\n\nThe firms profiting from China's rights abuses are often backed by Western investors.\n\nWhile Washington turns a blind eye, autocrats across the continent are muzzling their citizens online.\n\nAs the country prepares for the first post-Mugabe elections, the United States and its allies must use all the leverage they have to demand genuine reform.\n\nCommunications are routinely monitored and censored in China; poorly chosen words sent on WeChat , the main messaging platform, can land the sender in jail. This principle of intrusive surveillance is well established in Zimbabwe—last year’s Cybercrime and Cybersecurity Bill, for example, criminalized communicating falsehoods online, legal rhetoric that has been used in China to silence dissent. With the technology provided by the CloudWalk deal, government opponents will have even fewer places to hide.\n\nZimbabwe is not the only African country that seeks to emulate China’s model. Tanzania, a country that routinely harasses government critics, passed a law last year regarding online content that seems heavily influenced by the Chinese model. The Tanzanian law prohibits the posting of “false content,” just as “making falsehoods” is banned under Chinese law. The vague idea of “content that causes annoyance” is now verboten in Tanzania, just as “destroying the order of society” is in China. The Tanzanian government justified this law as a means of cracking down on “ moral decadence ”; China has previously banned “decadent” material from social media.\n\nWang notes that AI-powered recognition systems are not “fundamentally abusive.” CloudWalk agrees. “Whether or not privacy is ultimately violated depends on how the Zimbabwean government uses it,” said Fu Xiaolong, a spokesman for the company, adding that CloudWalk would not be responsible for any such decisions. “Just as the United States sells arms around the world—it does not care whether other governments use American weapons to kill people.”\n\nThe purported use of this kind of surveillance is to reduce harm, not increase it. Whether or not the technology is activated, the panopticon effect of visible surveillance—especially when labeled as facial recognition—has been claimed to reduce crime. Olander stresses that there is a “real need” for “genuine security measures” in Zimbabwe. “The new administration has been far more open than Robert Mugabe’s, so while I am concerned that this technology will be used for nefarious means … we should also give the benefit of the doubt that maybe the security services will use it for legitimate uses,” he said.\n\nBut activists on the ground in Zimbabwe aren’t so sure. “Past experience has also shown that the Zimbabwean government will use a legitimate excuse, for example, to preserve law and order as a guise to actually monitor and restrict citizens’ online expression and behaviors,” said Kuda Hove, a program officer for the Media Institute of Southern Africa, which promotes freedom of expression in Zimbabwe.\n\nChina is not the only country to sell surveillance technology to potentially abusive governments. A report by Security for Sale, an international consortium of journalists, found that between 2014 and 2017, almost one-third of licenses granted by the European Union to export surveillance products were to countries deemed “not free” by the watchdog Freedom House. The Zimbabwe deal is not unique—in 2016, Beijing donated $14 million worth of similar equipment to Ecuador, for example, which the Ecuadorian government claims has helped cut crime rates by 24 percent.\n\nCountries that have received Chinese technology are not able necessarily to mimic the extent of Chinese mass surveillance. “The entire surveillance infrastructure is no small feat: the systems and multilayered and numerous. To achieve the kind of surveillance state the Chinese government has, one also needs to implement, for example, a national identification card system and a real name registration system,” Wang noted. It’s also backed up, as Paul Mozur recently examined in the New York Times , by enormous amounts of manpower; the vast majority of surveillance in China is carried out by human watchers, not AI systems.\n\nThe Zimbabwe deal is unique in that as part of the agreement—the value of which CloudWalk declined to share—Harare will send data on millions of black faces to the Chinese company to help train the technology toward darker skin tones. The currency here is data as well as dollars.\n\n“People did not consent to the use of their biometric data in this way,” Hove said. “Unfortunately, people do not have any way of holding the government accountable as there are no laws in place or any regulatory body tasked with the protection of people’s privacy or data protection.” Zimbabwe’s 2002 Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act doesn’t cover biometric data or cross-border flows of data, and, as Hove notes, “the government has rarely ever acted in the people’s interests.”\n\nThe training of AI to work better on black faces is a significant opportunity for CloudWalk and for Chinese AI in general. A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab tested the accuracy of three major facial recognition software providers: Microsoft, IBM, and Megvii (a Chinese company). The study found that when attempting to identify the gender of a person from a picture, the error rate for lighter-skinned men was less than 1 percent, while for darker-skinned women it was up to 35 percent. This is because the accuracy of AI depends on the data it is fed, and, worldwide, facial recognition AI has been trained on predominantly white and male faces, even inside China.\n\nThere have been other racial upsets in the industry over the years—in 2015, Google apologized after its Google Photos app mistakenly labeled black people as gorillas. Brian Brackeen, the black founder of the Miami-based facial recognition company Kairos, recently said coded bias in algorithms meant that such technology should never be used by law enforcement. Facial recognition has largely failed in practice in open environments in the West; trials in the United Kingdom by police have resulted in 91 percent of cases being false positives.\n\nQuite how successful the system is in China is unclear; there are no independent studies or government watchdogs. But the government is reportedly building the world’s largest facial recognition database, using the access it has to the facial data of its 1.3 billion citizens. There is already some racial diversity within this, especially thanks to the mass surveillance and incarceration program that the government has implemented in the western province of Xinjiang, where the population is predominantly Muslim Uighurs of Turkic descent.\n\nBut with the CloudWalk deal, a Chinese company now has access to a data pool far more diverse than China’s ethnic makeup. So, while the government in Harare has paid out for the technology from CloudWalk, it’s likely that the company will benefit in the long term from this opportunity to rapidly improve its systems. Zimbabwean leaders are “getting access to technology and tools that they would never be able to afford on the open market if they didn’t have a currency other than the data of their own people to leverage against that,” Olander said. “For Natasha Msonza, the co-founder of the Digital Society of Zimbabwe, “it feels like [CloudWalk] is looking for guinea pigs,” she said, adding, “I don’t believe that the Zimbabwe government gave this proposition much thought before volunteering its citizens to be subjected to racial facial recognition experiments.”\n\nOther than increased security and surveillance measures, Zimbabweans will not see any return on the research that their personal data has helped accelerate. Acceleration is the whole point because the global AI race is ultimately a race to set standards. The Chinese government defines its ambitions as becoming the country that is “setting the pace.” As racial upsets in facial recognition have shown, the standards in this field are still to play for. But with unprecedented access to a more diverse range of data, Chinese companies are edging ever closer to this goal—spreading their model of authoritarianism along the way.\n\nAmy Hawkins is a

Letter #36: On friendship - Letters From Home \u0026 Away","link":"https://lettersfromhomeandaway.substack.com/p/-letter-36-on-friendship?s=r","content":"📩 Letter #36: On friendship And why it matters.\n\nDear Kate, On Memorial Day morning, I woke up in a $40 hostel in Bozeman, Montana.\n\nI wandered into a bathroom shared by a dozen other travelers, backpackers, and hikers. It smelled like sweat and stale popcorn. I wondered briefly: Am I getting too old for this?\n\nI got dressed and left to find coffee. Outside, the air was fresh with pine needles, the sun bright and sharp. I walked onto Main Street and found what felt like nearly all of the town’s 47,000 residents lining the sidewalk, waiting for the Memorial Day Parade to begin. Kids sat on their fathers’ shoulders, grandparents lounged in fold-up chairs. A Boy Scout handed me a flag to wave.\n\nFrom a perch on the curb, I watched Bozeman’s local rodeo champions, Elks Lodge leaders, and war veterans wave their own flags, riding in WW2-era Jeeps or on horseback. A high school marching band played. After the parade, while I ate eggs and hash browns at the counter of a local diner, a man in his 80s introduced himself. He wore a U.S. Air Force baseball cap. He asked if I was enjoying Bozeman and how long I’d be visiting. I told him I was just in town for a few days, wandering with my backpack. The world was open, I said. We could all go on adventures again.\n\nWe chatted for an hour, mostly about a shared love for small-town newspapers. He subscribed to 12. “Two in Minneapolis,” he said. “I like to know what’s going on in the big city.” As he got up to leave and pay his bill, the waitress waved away his rumpled $20 bill. “It’s been taken care of, sir,” she said with a smile. “Don’t worry about it.” He turned to me.\n\n“Did you do this?” I did not. Another man seated a few tables down smiled and tipped his own hat, emblazoned with a different branch of the U.S. military. “Thank you for your service,” the younger man said. They shook hands. A moment of mutual understanding passed. The older man rested a palm on the shoulder of his new friend. Had I woken up in a different decade? I was in Bozeman by happenstance. The Sunday before, I was sleeping on our dear friend’s couch in Nashville. The Sunday before that, I was sleeping on my brother’s couch in Manhattan. Montana was the last leg of the adventure. I was there for a family trip—a pre-planned meeting of extended relatives up in the mountains. The Internet economy lured me to extend my travels from Nashville straight to Montana: A budget airline flight from Nashville to Bozeman + three nights at the hostel (booked through Airbnb) was still cheaper than flights home to Texas and back. Adventure! I thought. Travel! Excitement! If it sounds chaotic, it was. I visited three cities in two weeks. I took a laptop, a sweatshirt, two pairs of shorts, a little black dress, and a toothbrush. That’s it.\n\nFinally, I would be out in the world, I thought as I packed. I imagined traveling—hopping on flights, walking briskly through airports, sending work emails from coffee shops—would make me feel like my old self. A woman with places to be and things to do.\n\nBut free to roam, with flights to any imaginable destination just a click away (credit card points!), an unlimited number of new people to meet, and nothing to tie me down but a backpack, I felt more unmoored than ever.\n\nWhere should I go? What should I see? The answer, it seemed: Everything.\n\nWhen I first started planning in the cold weeks of February, my goal was simple: to reconnect with everyone I’d lost. I would go back to all the best friends, mentors, co-workers, drinking buddies, and neighbors who had been torn away by a year of unexpected circumstance. I would find them and hold them close.\n\nFind them I did. There were parties, toasts, hugs, and tears. There was steak with chimichurri sauce, crispy cauliflower pizza, and roasted salmon drenched with lemon and capers. I could cry thinking about how lovely it was to see everyone, to hold our friends and pat their hands. I also marveled at the sacrifices made for me: “Need to do your laundry? Sure, c’mon over. Hungry? Dinner is just about done. Sleepy? Coffee is brewing.” I found myself reflecting on the beauty of long relationships. Our friends have seen me at my best. They’ve also seen me at my worst. There’s an implicit promise in tossing a blanket on the couch: “I’m here for you tonight. And I’ll be here for you tomorrow.” These relationships weren’t born out of thin air. They were forged in a particular place: the Upper West Side of New York. We lived there. We went to church there. We went to school there. (Well you went to school there, not me. I was busy napping in Riverside Park with an Absolute Bagel wrapper still stuck to my hand.) We were in each other’s lives. We were neighbors. Now, we’re scattered across the country, plunked down in California and Tennessee, along the East Coast and in my own little house in Texas. Sitting at that diner in Montana, watching the locals in Bozeman spend time together, mark Memorial Day together, just be with one another, I felt a twist of sadness: What makes a place home?\n\nCertainly not a $40 hostel. Scroll through Twitter just once and you’ll find praise for a transient lifestyle. “Live as a digital nomad,” they say. Move from Airbnb to Airbnb. Never sign a lease. Travel wherever you want, whenever you want. Sell your possessions. Join the YOLO economy , and choose #VanLife forever . Freedom, if only we could get it, would feel so, so good. But as I’ve written before : Freedom is cheap. What we don’t acknowledge is the high cost of a life without commitment. Without commitment—to a place, to a family, to a group of friends—I wouldn’t have had anyone or anything to go back to. I’d have gotten my shot in the arm with no plans to make. In 1978, social scientists published a study titled, “ Lottery winners and accident victims: Is happiness relative? ” The study compared the self-reported happiness levels of lucky victors, victims, and a control group. Did money make a difference in their happiness? It turned out, not really. “The lottery winners were no happier than the controls, at least in any statistically meaningful sense,” an opinion writer at the NYT explained. “If anything, the warp and weft of their everyday lives was a little more threadbare. Talking to friends, hearing jokes, having breakfast—all of these simple pleasures now left them less satisfied than before.”\n\nOne of the researchers, a man named Philip Brickman, argued that happiness for all three groups was largely derived from one thing: Commitments. Especially when those commitments conflicted with freedom. “Happiness,” he wrote in his book Commitment, Conflict, and Caring, “involves the enthusiastic and unambivalent acceptance of activities or relationships that are not the best that might possibly be obtained .”\n\nMeaningful relationships are formed through commitment, not through freedom. You don’t need to search the entire country’s bars and restaurants for your perfect pals. Just pick some people, science says. Commit to them. They might not be NBA players or millionaires. But they’ll be yours. And that will be the best thing of all.\n\nOn my last day in Bozeman, I wandered through the town’s graveyard. I read the dates on the headstones: Grandparents born in the 19th century, parents born in the early 20th, children and grandchildren born in the 21st. The names changed through the years, Reginald and Hazel Lue becoming Kyle and Susan. But the titles didn’t.\n\nWhat commitments will we be remembered by? Today, as the world re-opens, there’s a surge of enthusiasm for tossing caution out the window and running headlong into the wind. For me, two weeks of traveling was enough. I’m thinking about how I can commit to my new home in Texas instead.\n\nYesterday, while I was walking through the neighborhood, my mailman said hi to me by name. By NAME! I wasn’t even at my own house… so he didn’t recognize me from my address. He recognized ME! I consider that progress. It might not go on my gravestone, but we all have to start somewhere. Miss you lots. XOXO,\n\nThe book: A Swim in a Pond in the Rain by George Saunders Why you should read it: I expect everyone to know that when I refer to my close personal friend, advisor, and confidant, George, I am referring to George Saunders, a man I have never met. George is my guy. George is the man. George is wise, and funny, and smart. George did me the favor of publishing the syllabus he teaches in his Creative Fiction MFA course at Syracuse for the low price of $28. No cold winters in upstate New York for me! I will learn all the lessons George has to offer about writing and reading from my couch at home. Thanks George. What else you should read: If you don’t have time for a full book about the craft and form of writing, check out this little essay George wrote on the subject. (He expands on a lot of these ideas in the book, but this hits the highlights.)\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

one have to be a genius to do maths? | What's new","link":"https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths","content":"Updates on my research and expository papers, discussion of open problems, and other maths-related topics. By Terence Tao\n\nBetter beware of notions like genius and inspiration; they are a sort of magic wand and should be used sparingly by anybody who wants to see things clearly. ( José Ortega y Gasset , “Notes on the novel”)\n\nDoes one have to be a genius to do mathematics?\n\nThe popular image of the lone (and possibly slightly mad) genius – who ignores the literature and other conventional wisdom and manages by some inexplicable inspiration (enhanced, perhaps, with a liberal dash of suffering) to come up with a breathtakingly original solution to a problem that confounded all the experts – is a charming and romantic image, but also a wildly inaccurate one, at least in the world of modern mathematics. We do have spectacular, deep and remarkable results and insights in this subject, of course, but they are the hard-won and cumulative achievement of years, decades, or even centuries of steady work and progress of many good and great mathematicians; the advance from one stage of understanding to the next can be highly non-trivial, and sometimes rather unexpected, but still builds upon the foundation of earlier work rather than starting totally anew. (This is for instance the case with Wiles ‘ work on Fermat’s last theorem , or Perelman ‘s work on the Poincaré conjecture .)\n\nActually, I find the reality of mathematical research today – in which progress is obtained naturally and cumulatively as a consequence of hard work, directed by intuition, literature, and a bit of luck – to be far more satisfying than the romantic image that I had as a student of mathematics being advanced primarily by the mystic inspirations of some rare breed of “geniuses”. This “ cult of genius ” in fact causes a number of problems, since nobody is able to produce these (very rare) inspirations on anything approaching a regular basis, and with reliably consistent correctness. (If someone affects to do so, I advise you to be very sceptical of their claims.) The pressure to try to behave in this impossible manner can cause some to become overly obsessed with “big problems” or “big theories” , others to lose any healthy scepticism in their own work or in their tools , and yet others still to become too discouraged to continue working in mathematics. Also, attributing success to innate talent (which is beyond one’s control) rather than effort, planning, and education (which are within one’s control) can lead to some other problems as well .\n\nOf course, even if one dismisses the notion of genius, it is still the case that at any given point in time, some mathematicians are faster, more experienced, more knowledgeable, more efficient, more careful, or more creative than others. This does not imply, though, that only the “best” mathematicians should do mathematics; this is the common error of mistaking absolute advantage for comparative advantage . The number of interesting mathematical research areas and problems to work on is vast – far more than can be covered in detail just by the “best” mathematicians, and sometimes the set of tools or ideas that you have will find something that other good mathematicians have overlooked, especially given that even the greatest mathematicians still have weaknesses in some aspects of mathematical research. As long as you have education, interest , and a reasonable amount of talent, there will be some part of mathematics where you can make a solid and useful contribution. It might not be the most glamorous part of mathematics , but actually this tends to be a healthy thing; in many cases the mundane nuts-and-bolts of a subject turn out to actually be more important than any fancy applications. Also, it is necessary to “cut one’s teeth” on the non-glamorous parts of a field before one really has any chance at all to tackle the famous problems in the area; take a look at the early publications of any of today’s great mathematicians to see what I mean by this.\n\nIn some cases, an abundance of raw talent may end up (somewhat perversely) to actually be harmful for one’s long-term mathematical development; if solutions to problems come too easily, for instance, one may not put as much energy into working hard , asking dumb questions , or increasing one’s range , and thus may eventually cause one’s skills to stagnate. Also, if one is accustomed to easy success, one may not develop the patience necessary to deal with truly difficult problems (see also this talk by Peter Norvig for an analogous phenomenon in software engineering). Talent is important, of course; but how one develops and nurtures it is even more so.\n\nIt’s also good to remember that professional mathematics is not a sport (in sharp contrast to mathematics competitions ). The objective in mathematics is not to obtain the highest ranking, the highest “score”, or the highest number of prizes and awards; instead, it is to increase understanding of mathematics (both for yourself, and for your colleagues and students), and to contribute to its development and applications. For these tasks, mathematics needs all the good people it can get.\n\nAlready have a WordPress.com account?

If it hurts, you're probably doing it wrong.\n\n2. You're not trying your best if you're not happy.\n\nThis is a linkpost for https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort/\n\n(Content warning: self-harm, parts of this post may be actively counterproductive for readers with certain mental illnesses or idiosyncrasies.)\n\nWhat doesn't kill you makes you stronger. ~ Kelly Clarkson.\n\nThe more bitterness you swallow, the higher you'll go. ~ Chinese proverb.\n\nI noticed recently that, at least in my social bubble, pain is the unit of effort. In other words, how hard you are trying is explicitly measured by how much suffering you put yourself through. In this post, I will share some anecdotes of how damaging and pervasive this belief is, and propose some counterbalancing ideas that might help rectify this problem.\n\n1. As a child, I spent most of my evenings studying mathematics under some amount of supervision from my mother. While studying, if I expressed discomfort or fatigue, my mother would bring me a snack or drink and tell me to stretch or take a break. I think she took it as a sign that I was trying my best. If on the other hand I was smiling or joyful for extended periods of time, she took that as a sign that I had effort to spare and increased the hours I was supposed to study each day. To this day there's a gremlin on my shoulder that whispers, \"If you're happy, you're not trying your best.\"\n\n2. A close friend who played sports in school reports that training can be harrowing. He told me that players who fell behind the pack during for daily jogs would be singled out and publicly humiliated. One time the coach screamed at my friend for falling behind the asthmatic boy who was alternating between running and using his inhaler. Another time, my friend internalized \"no pain, no gain\" to the point of losing his toenails.\n\n3. In high school and college, I was surrounded by overachievers constantly making (what seemed to me) incomprehensibly bad life choices. My classmates would sign up for eight classes per semester when the recommended number is five, jigsaw extracurricular activities into their calendar like a dynamic programming knapsack-solver, and then proceed to have loud public complaining contests about which libraries are most comfortable to study at past 2am and how many pages they have left to write for the essay due in three hours. Only later did I learn to ask: what incentives were they responding to?\n\n4. A while ago I became a connoisseur of Chinese webnovels. Among those written for a male audience, there is a surprisingly diverse set of character traits represented among the main characters. Doubtless many are womanizing murderhobos with no redeeming qualities, but others are classical heroes with big hearts, or sarcastic antiheroes who actually grow up a little, or ambitious empire-builders with grand plans to pave the universe with Confucian order, or down-on-their-luck starving artists who just want to bring happiness to the world through song.\n\nIf there is a single common virtue shared by all these protagonists, it is their superhuman pain tolerance . Protagonists routinely and often voluntarily dunk themselves in vats of lava, have all their bones broken, shattered, and reforged, get trapped inside alternate dimensions of freezing cold for millennia (which conveniently only takes a day in the outside world), and overdose on level-up pills right up to the brink of death, all in the name of becoming stronger. Oftentimes the defining difference between the protagonist and the antagonist is that the antagonist did not have enough pain tolerance and allowed the (unbearable physical) suffering in his life to drive him mad.\n\n5. I have a close friend who often asks for my perspective on personal problems. A pattern arose in a couple of our conversations:\n\nalkjash: I feel like you're not actually trying. [Meaning: using all the tools at your disposal, getting creative, throwing money at the problem to make it go away.]\n\nalkjash's friend: What do you mean I'm not trying? I think I'm trying my best, can't you tell how hard I'm trying? [Meaning: piling on time, energy, and willpower to the point of burnout.]\n\nAfter several of these conversations went nowhere, I learned that asking this friend to try harder directly translated in his mind to accusing him of low pain tolerance and asking him to hurt himself more.\n\nI often hear on the internet laments like \"Why is nobody actually trying?\" Once upon a time, I was honestly and genuinely confused by this question. It seemed to me that \"actually trying\" - aiming the full force of your being at the solution of a problem you care about - is self-evidently motivating and requires zero extra justification if you care about the problem.\n\nI think I finally understand why so few people are \"actually trying.\" The reason is this pervasive and damaging belief that pain is the unit of effort. With this belief, the injunction \"actually try\" means \"put yourself in as much pain as you can handle.\" Similarly, \"she's trying her best\" translates to \"she's really hurting right now.\" Even worse, people with this belief optimize for the appearance of suffering . Answering emails at midnight and appearing fatigued at meetings are somehow taken to be more credible signals of effort than actual results. And if you think that's pathological, wait until you meet someone for whom telling them about opportunities actively hurts them , because you've just created another knife they feel pressured to cut themselves with.\n\nI see a mob of people walking up to houses and throwing themselves bodily at the closed front doors. I walk up to block one man and ask, \"Stop it! Why don't you try the doorknob first? Have you rung the doorbell?\" The man responds in tears, nursing his bloody right shoulder, \"I'm trying as hard as I can!\" With his one good arm, he shoves me aside and takes a running start to lunge at the door again. Finally, the timber shatters and the man breaks through. The surrounding mob cheers him on, \"Look how hard he's trying!\"\n\nOnce you understand that pain is how people define effort, the answer to the question \"why is nobody actually trying?\" becomes astoundingly obvious. I'd like to propose two beliefs to counterbalance this awful state of affairs.\n\n1. If it hurts, you're probably doing it wrong.\n\nIf your wrists ache on the bench press, you're probably using bad form and/or too much weight. If your feet ache from running, you might need sneakers with better arch support. If you're consistently sore for days after exercising, you should learn to stretch properly and check your nutrition.\n\nSuch rules are well-established in the setting of physical exercise, but their analogs in intellectual work seem to be completely lost on people. If reading a math paper is actively unpleasant, you should find a better-written paper or learn some background material first (most likely both). If you study or work late into the night and it disrupts your Circadian rhythm, you're trading off long-term productivity and well-being for low-quality work. That's just bad form.\n\nIf it hurts, you're probably doing it wrong.\n\n2. You're not trying your best if you're not happy.\n\nHappiness is really, really instrumentally useful. Being happy gives you more energy, increases your physical health and lifespan, makes you more creative and risk-tolerant, and (even if all the previous effects are unreplicated pseudoscience) causes other people to like you more. Whether you are tackling the Riemann hypothesis, climate change, or your personal weight loss, one of the first steps should be to acquire as much happiness as you can get your hands on. And the good news is: at least anecdotally , it is possible to substantially raise your happiness set-point through jedi mind tricks.\n\nBecoming happy is a fully general problem-solving strategy. And although one can in principle trade off happiness for short bursts of productivity, in practice this is never worth it.\n\nCulturally, we've been led to believe that over-stressed and tired people are the ones trying their best. It is right and proper to be kind to such people, but let's not go so far as to support the delusion that they are inputting as much effort as their joyful, boisterous peers bouncing off the

asked Alicia Kennedy to share her advice on interviewing. She calls From the Desk of Alicia Kennedy Podcast , her weekly podcast that’s part of her food newsletter, “a curated conversation series.” She recently wrote about her belief in unscripted, unedited interviews here . Read on for her advice, or listen to her read it aloud above.\n\nDear writer and podcaster, what’s the secret to a good interview?\n\nMy podcast always begins with the same question: “Can you tell me about where you grew up and what you ate?” This establishes the conversation in some straightforward biography, while also grounding it in the flavors and food philosophies that have shaped the guest’s life. From there, the audience and I will get to go deeper, but the guest sets the terms of the conversation by choosing what and how much to share. Do they become wistful and nostalgic, or do these memories seem painful? Are they tinged by grief and loss, or by joy and whimsy? The question sets the tone and tenor of the rest of the conversation.\n\nTo me, a good interview is governed by the same thing as good nonfiction writing: curiosity. I’ve made mistakes before by doing interviews with people whose work I, frankly, was not curious about, and that means I’m just going through the motions. But what makes an interview good for the audience—whether a listener or reader—is that the people having the conversation are actively engaged with each other, and ideally with each other’s work. As an interviewer, I want the people listening to feel like they’re overhearing a natural conversation, something that would happen spontaneously after the plates are cleared away from the dinner table and all that’s left is some wine and cake.\n\nThere also needs to be a spirit of generosity on the part of the person being interviewed. When people come on who’ve never bothered to listen to a past episode and don’t respond generously to good-faith questions, it can feel like pulling teeth. I’ve learned for myself, whether I’m the host or the guest, that I shouldn’t show up unless I can get locked into having a generous conversation. This means being curious and being engaged, of course, but also believing that every question is a good question, a worthwhile question, and if I think perhaps it hasn’t been phrased well, that I can reframe it in my response.\n\nIn order to facilitate better conversations, I send my guests the questions a week ahead of time. This provides not too much time to overprepare and thus kill spontaneity, but it does allow them to get a sense of the trajectory of the conversation and tell me whether they’d prefer to go in another direction. I want guests to be comfortable and know that it will be a safe space for anything they wish to talk about, and I like to establish their boundaries ahead of time.\n\nI try to ask big, open questions, too, so that the guest feels free to take their response in any direction. Specific questions, I’ve found, lend themselves too easily to simple answers. The worst feeling is to receive a “yes” or “no” in response. Though sometimes one can want to flex just how deep they’ve researched in their questions, I find it better to be looser and to let the guest guide the conversation a bit, because their spontaneity will also be more compelling to the listener.\n\nIn writing these bigger, more open questions, I dive into all the person’s work and also try to listen to or read past interviews. I want to honor the subjects that drive the guest’s life while also bringing something different to it, something less anticipated. My questions that I ask to everyone are very important for this reason, such as in how I begin, but also in how I finish, which is with the same two questions. Each guest responds to the same questions in new ways.\n\nI used to ask just, “For you, is cooking a political act?” but I change it up based on whether the guest has told me they like to cook or not. If they don’t, I ask about writing or bartending or whatever it is they put all their soul into. I’ve begun to add the question “How do you define abundance?” because the concept of “abundance” keeps working its way into my own writing—how we define it, yes, as well as how to cultivate it and how to reframe it in a world that tries to tell us abundance looks one way, means one thing.\n\nMy podcast is, in this way, an extension of my writing, a way to engage with its themes with folks who’ve done different kinds of work in food and culture, who can bring new perspectives to themes I work with consistently. We all eat and engage with food differently, and I want to honor that diversity through generous, curious conversation.\n\nCould you use some advice or inspiration from a fellow writer about creativity, motivation, and the writing life?

I really love the coffee/cafe culture here. Not only is the coffee excellent, but also there's an attention to details that offer homeyness, like a side cushion for drinks, vibrant plants, and a light-filled space. It exemplifies the sort of mid-century, modern living that permeates the city: the bike-filled streets, the abundance of upscale furniture stores, the neat rows of brownstone houses.\n\nI've been thinking about what it feels like to be perceived by others and how that resulting pressure changes how you act. I have a history of my authentic identity feeling repressed by some pressure to embody the \"right\" image in whatever social environment I inhabit. If I broke up my life into arcs, this would characterize the biggest character development arc, one to unlearn this automatic conforming.\n\nI grew up learning how to be a chameleon. I learned to perfectly blend into my surroundings to avoid drawing attention. Survival via obscurity was encoded into my very being. Even being \"successful\" was a form of obscure survival. Being successful as a kid meant finding a good professional life that many in society sought—the stable, \"normal\" life that you were supposed to work towards. The American dream story of working hard, having a large social circle of friends, and coming back to a happy family every day.\n\nAt some point, I realized that the dream was a mirage—that hard work sometimes made you worse off than not working at all; that friends come and go and intimate connections can be found in the most ephemeral of places; that a happy family is really a composition of millions of infinitesimal daily commitments to working on it rather than a one-and-done deal. Life is a series of illusions. I learned how to weave my own, an image to appeal to everyone.\n\nNow, I'm learning to leverage my shapeshifting intentionally. I met someone recently who chose different names for different parts of his life. He had a wardrobe of identities for meeting new people. Instead of the conventional advice to always be yourself, which I find too general and pithy to be useful, this gives you the freedom to embrace multiple identities. We're always inhabiting an identity, and our \"real selves\" can manifest as so many diverse embodiments. I'm thinking of the parable of the blind men and an elephant , how there is an incomprehensible amount of detail to be perceived even in one person. When others perceive you, they're only experiencing such a small portion of your constellation of being. That's not to say that the amount they are experiencing is small in absolute terms—rather, your fullness of being is so deep and always expanding. So much so that we spend our entire lives learning more about ourselves, how our bodies curl in the shape of an aubade in the filtered dawn light, how our hearts swell to bursting at the sight of a crush, how our minds can leap between mental and emotional universes at the drop of a word.\n\nBeing able to see others is a gift. It's an opportunity to comprehend a piece of an infinite world. We're living in a glacial field, millions of icebergs bobbing together in the sway of salty ocean waves. We drift together and break apart. We shine beautifully in the evening light. We hide bulks under the surface in our hearts.\n\nI want my infinite identities to reflect what I find most compelling in every moment. To use my shapeshifting in a way that amplifies the goodness in the world rather than blending into the background. To fight with kindness. Always. Waging war on behalf of our little field of ice in the wide ocean, all for the fleeting moments we share drifting together. And isn’t it nice drifting here, in this moment?\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Should it all end tonight, I can positively say there would be no regrets. I feel fortunate to have walked 90 years in my shoes. I am truly lucky. I really have lived 1,000 times over.”\n\nThose are the opening lines of the final entry in my grandmother Zelda’s journal—a 270-page leather-bound journal she wrote small entries in almost every morning during the final decade of her life. In it, she reflected on lessons she had learned, lessons she was still learning, and the experiences that made these understandings possible.\n\nWhen my grandmother was diagnosed with terminal cancer on her 90th birthday, I sat with her in a hospital room for the entire day, in silence, in laughter, in tears, and in awe. Although her body was weak, her mind was intensely strong. The terminal diagnosis inspired her to think about her life, everything she had journaled about over the years, and reflect aloud. So, I gave her the stage—my undivided attention—from sunrise until sunset.\n\nAs I sat beside her hospital bed, she thumbed through her journal one page at a time , reading dozens of specific entries she wanted me to hear. She spoke softly and passionately about her life, her loves, her losses, her pain, her dreams, her achievements, her happiness, and all the lessons that embodied these points of reference. It was without a doubt one of the most enlightening and unforgettable days of my life.\n\nMy grandmother passed away exactly two weeks later, peacefully in her sleep. The day after her passing I found out she formally left her journal for me in her will. Since then, I have read it from cover to cover countless times.\n\nAlthough I have shared some of her insights and quotes with blog subscribers , course students , and coaching clients in the past, today would have been my grandmother’s 105th birthday, so I’d like to honor her. To do so, I’m going to re-share excerpts from the journal entries that she shared with me in that hospital room fifteen years ago. I’ve done my best to sort, clean up, copyedit and reorganize her wisdom into 19 inspiring bullet points. I hope you find value in them, too:\n\nAs I’m wrapping up this short tribute to my grandmother, I’m reminded of a poem by Christian D. Larson that she used to have hanging on her refrigerator when I was a kid. As soon as I was old enough to understand the poem, my grandmother made a photocopy of it for me, and, over 30 years later, I still have that same photocopy laminated and hanging on my office bulletin board. These are words I do my best to live by:\n\nTo be so strong that nothing can disturb your peace of mind. To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person you meet.\n\nTo make all your friends feel that there is something in them To look at the sunny side of everything and make your optimism come true.\n\nTo think only the best, to work only for the best, and to expect only the best. To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as you are about your own.\n\nTo forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the greater achievements of the future. To wear a cheerful countenance at all times and give every living creature you meet a smile.\n\nTo give so much time to the improvement of yourself that you have no time to criticize others.

Visit www.effectivealtruism.org for more information.\n\nEA Global is a conference series for the effective altruism (EA) community. Attendees and speakers coordinate on global projects, share new research and opportunities, keep up-to-date with the evolving ideas of effective altruism, and connect with each other.\n\nEA Global conferences typically last around 3 days and involve talks, workshops, discussions, and many chances to connect and network with people in EA.\n\nEA Global is designed for people who have a solid understanding of the main concepts of effective altruism, and who are making decisions and taking significant actions based on them.\n\nThis may sound like a high bar, but we do sometimes admit people who view themselves as less experienced.\n\nIf you want to attend but are unsure about whether to apply, please err on the side of applying!\n\nEA Global conferences are not the only events for people interested in effective altruism! EAGx conferences are locally-organized conferences designed primarily for people:\n\nSee the EAGx page for more information, like what to expect and who should apply.\n\nWhat’s the difference between an EAG and EAGx?\n\nEAGx events are similar to EA Global conferences; they are opportunities for people interested in effective altruism to make connections, exchange ideas, and attend talks and workshops. EA Global conferences are organized by the Centre for Effective Altruism. EAGx events, on the other hand, are mostly community-organized with some support from the EA Global team.\n\nThe target audiences for the two types of event are also different. As described above, EA Global conferences tend to be meant for people already taking significant actions based on the principles of effective altruism. Read more about EAGx conferences here .\n\nTo attend a conference, you’ll need to submit an application , which the admissions team will evaluate. If you get in, you will then be invited to register for the conference and buy a ticket.\n\nOur admissions system helps us allocate our limited spots to the applicants who seem most able to help each other pursue their goals. You can read more about how applications are evaluated here .\n\nTicket prices differ by event, but we offer discounts and financial support to make sure that cost is not prohibitive for anyone. Students are admitted to events free of charge by default.\n\nWe provide ticket discounts for everyone who needs them. You can apply these discounts on the registration page once you’ve been admitted.\n\nWe also sometimes provide travel support . If you may need travel support in order to attend, you should let us know during your application; there is a designated question about this. Requesting travel support does not lower your chance of being accepted to the conference. You can see more on travel support here .\n\nYou can also apply to volunteer in exchange for a free ticket.\n\nPlease take financial aid and travel support if you feel you need it — if we’ve accepted you, we think it will be valuable for you to come. Additionally, in order to ensure accessibility, we’re happy to provide travel support for everyone who feels they need it to the EAGx conference that’s most conveniently located for them (in any given year), or to EA Global if they’ve been accepted to that. This means that if you live in Estonia and it’s easiest for you to get to EAGxBerlin, you can apply for (and expect to get) travel support for that trip.\n\nIf you are a student, the ticket cost is waived by default. If the ticket costs are prohibitive, you should ask for discounts. If the costs are restrictive and you might find yourself making tradeoffs that don’t make sense from the point of view of impact (like booking a trip that’s $50 cheaper but 5 hours longer), then please still request financial aid. We feel that many people who should request financial aid don’t ask for it, so err on the side of asking.\n\nAs to our reasoning: strictly limiting ticket-price flexibility and funding makes sense if you are a provider of a service to paying customers. But, while we hope our conferences are fun and valuable for the attendees, we don’t believe that attendees are the ultimate customers of our conferences. Instead, we view attendees as contributors, too. Our hope is that, through these conferences, we help attendees help the world in a variety of ways — which is the Centre for Effective Altruism’s ultimate mission . So it seems reasonable to take a collaborative approach to event costs.\n\nVolunteers are crucial to the success of our conferences. Volunteers sign up to work a minimum number of shifts and attend volunteer training before the event starts, but besides these times, participate in the conference as all attendees do. This is why we require you to be accepted to the conference as an attendee before you can offer to volunteer.\n\nIn the past, volunteers have found connecting with each other and the conference organizers to be extremely valuable, and we view this benefit as a crucial aspect of the volunteering process.\n\nWe think volunteering is particularly useful for:\n\nTo volunteer, simply express interest in the application for the event itself.\n\nIf you may need a visa in order to attend, you should apply as early as possible, and let us know during your application; there is a designated question about this.

Many things are far below where they should be, many actions fail to achieve their goals, and this includes many of your actions. And this is not because you’re failing, but because achieving your goals is hard.\n\nThis is obviously not a problem that can ever be solved. But one thing I find interesting is that often my mistakes are obvious and can be fixed, if only someone points them out! Indeed, often I can notice my mistakes, if someone just prompts me to stop and consider what I’m currently getting wrong. The problem is not some deep, ineffable mystery in the world, but rather just that I am not stopping to ask myself the right questions.\n\nAgain, I think this is an understandable mistake. The step of zooming out, being meta, and asking myself the right questions is hard. It is not the default action . The problem right in front of me always feels urgent, going meta never feels like the thing I should do right now, so I never do it. But this thought pattern is a mistake. What are the common mistakes you make in your life? What things do you miss, until someone points them out to you? Could you be doing better?\n\nMy main tool for this is having a weekly review - a routine where I set out a regular time to reflect on my life, how it’s going, and what I want to change. A routine that makes reflection the default in my life . When people are getting started on debugging their life and ask me for first steps, this is one of my main recommendations - I find it extremely useful, and I think it’s a key basis for noticing your mistakes and actually doing something about them. This post is my case for why this is a worthy habit, and how I think about implementing it.\n\nI find there’s a lot of value in just making time to stop and reflect on your life, even if you don’t have a concrete plan - this makes reflection and going meta the default, which is the key first step! But I think it is even more valuable to go in with good questions, to get yourself thinking in the right way.\n\nI think the importance of good framing is highly underappreciated - my life is full of blind spots and systematic mistakes, but asking the right questions can often make those blind spots obvious. A common example is the planning fallacy: when I take on a new project, I am always too optimistic. I expect things to be easy, for nothing to go wrong, and think I’ll get it done extremely quickly. But inevitably get bogged down in details and distractions, and fall far short of my goal. But, if I instead ask myself the question “how long did this type of project take before?”, and take an average, I am way more accurate.\n\nA key mental move here is pre-hindsight : It’s much easier to explain a past event with hindsight, than it is to predict something in the future, or notice something unexpected - the past is concrete and easy to reason about, the future is abstract and harder. But this is just a state of mind! For example, when I am writing an email, I often realise a mistake or missed detail just after I click send. Absolutely nothing has actually changed, but the email goes from a future thing to a past thing. And often this mental shift can happen deliberately - take something vague and fuzzy that my mind wants to flinch away from, and make it concrete. For example, I find it hard to notice mistakes when I make them, but easy to answer “what was the biggest mistake I made this week?” - the key is to make not answering not an option, and to implicitly assume there was a mistake.\n\nWhat mistakes did I make this week?\n\nWhat am I being an idiot about?\n\nWhat was my biggest success this week?\n\nWhat is my biggest bottleneck?\n\nWhat is the right lesson to take from this week?\n\nIn an ideal version of this week, I would have […]\n\nWhat am I currently procrastinating about?\n\nWhose advice will help me solve my problems?\n\nWhat is my current biggest priority?\n\nOf course, the right questions are going to be specific to you! I like questions that focus on what I’m missing, prioritisation, learning and improvement, tracking progress, asking for help, bottlenecks, etc. The right questions for you will come from your goals, and what you often miss out on.\n\nExercise: What are some questions that you would like to answer once a week? Are there any past mistakes, that you needed someone else to point out to you? Big, systematic blind spots? Small things, that slip through the cracks? What questions would it have been useful to ask yourself, over the past month?\n\nIt’s easy to agree that going meta and reflecting is valuable, and far harder to actually do it. The core problem is that reflecting often feels important, but rarely feels like the top priority. It’s easy to be stuck in the short-term, chasing whatever is currently top of my mind, and letting my blind spots forever remain blind spots. And I think it is hard to just spontaneously decide to be meta where appropriate. So the second key insight of this post is that you need to systematise going meta - make it the default in your life. I personally find it easiest to do this by having a routine - thus the weekly review - but the important part is to follow whatever systems work best for you.\n\nI outline my general thoughts on systematising things in a previous post , but for this, the key parts are to build a routine around it, to minimise decision points and to keep the routine sacrosanct . Some tips:\n\nSet out a clear time once a week, and put this in your calendar.\n\nMake it a clear and consistent time, so it keeps the routine, and so there’s never a decision about when to do it.\n\nHaving it be weekly is just a default suggestion, the key is to be regular. Depending on how much you have worth reviewing, some people prefer daily reviews, monthly reviews, etc\n\nIt can also be valuable to have short daily reviews, longer weekly reviews that zoom out more, even longer monthly reviews that zoom out even more, etc - whatever works best for you!\n\nThis tiered approach can be useful to eg think about deeper questions, like questioning your current goals - this would be silly to do every day, but can be highly worth the effort once a month\n\nHave a clear plan for what to do during that time\n\nThis makes there be a clear default\n\nI find it valuable to make myself a Google Form , with a list of questions, and boxes to answer them in - this makes the review literally just to fill out this form, always with a clear next action, and a clear order\n\nBy minimising decision points during the review, this helps stop aversion to doing the review build up - make it as low effort as possible!\n\nRemind yourself of why the review is important, and why you care about it, if you ever feel tempted to cancel\n\nI personally feel fine with changing the time of the review, but try to ensure it feels important to do the review - I haven’t missed a week in the last year\n\nThis is easier when there’s some momentum behind the review - invest effort at the start to get yourself to do it. But once you’ve done it a few times, and found it useful, use this to help motivate yourself to keep to it. I find it useful to keep in mind that skipping a review once isn’t just skipping it once - it’s eroding the habit, and making me more likely to skip all future reviews!\n\nIf you didn’t find it useful, stop doing it!\n\nThough, if you do skip it, try to avoid failing with abandon ! A good routine is flexible, and can take a few missed weeks - you do it because it’s useful, not just to maintain a perfect streak\n\nGetting started: If you like the idea, but feel uncertain whether it’s actually worth the effort, try thinking of it as an experiment! Do it once a week for the next 3 weeks, and at the end of that check whether it’s useful\n\nI find it much easier to convince myself to do bounded experiments - I have an aversion to starting unbounded commitments, but I think this is often reasonable!\n\nAccountability: Use sticks, find ways to get your future self to keep to it\n\nArrange to send an email with the findings of the review to a friend\n\nArrange to do the review with a friend - have a weekly check-in call! Accountability buddys are great\n\nSet yourself financial penalties, with a site like Beeminder\n\nIt’s also great to have positive ways to make it stick, and feel motivating!\n\nHaving a buddy can do this - I personally find social things way more motivating\n\nI do a gratitude practice in mine - thinking about the people who improved my week, and thanking them - this makes me look forwards to it way more!\n\nAt the end, record the key takeaways of the review - this is a way to remind yourself that it’s useful\n\nAnother benefit of having a weekly time to check in and review your life, is that this makes debugging anything else in your life easier. If you have any new ideas for weekly habits, blind spots, new things you want to try, it’s much easier to attach them to your weekly review. By having a reliable time when you go meta and reflect, it can make everything else in your life go more smoothly! Some suggestions for good things to peg to it: (I’m trying to throw out a ton of suggestions here - I recommend picking the few that seem most helpful. Don’t try to do all of them!)\n\nRegular debugging - I ask myself what my biggest bottleneck is, then set a 5 minute timer and try to solve it. Sometimes this works!\n\nI find it difficult to carve out time for this kind of debugging in the moment - it’s never the default\n\nLong-term goals, eg overcoming anxiety, meeting more people, going outside of your comfort zone\n\nProductivity - eg, do you feel less productive in winter ?\n\nWas I a person who actually does things?\n\nAm I being a good friend ? Is there anything I could be doing better?\n\nTime tracking - what did you spend your time on this week? Was that a good allocation? How do you want to allocate your time next week?\n\nPrioritisation - What are your current goals? Is what you’re working on actually your highest priority?\n\nMotivation - Why are you working on what you’re currently doing? What was a success this week? How did I make progress on my goals?\n\nThis can be really useful when my standards are too high , and I always feel overworked and behind - this forces me to reflect and realise that, actually, I’m doing pretty well. The problem is my standards, not me!\n\nAm I excited about what I am currently working on ? If not, what can I do about this? Is there something more fun I could be doing?\n\nI find this one super easy to lose track of in the moment, but is a major productivity and happiness drain\n\nCollecting data on longer term experiments, eg trying a new learning style\n\nNotice what you’re currently procrastinating about ( especially things without deadlines !)\n\nNotice what you’re putting off - what are the open loops in your mind?\n\nMy system is to have an hour once a week for doing “life admin” - all the random tiny tasks on my to do list that are never my higher priority\n\nHaving a clear time once a week where I trust that I’ll do it is valuable - it reduces the mental load the rest of the time, because I feel comfortable forgetting about it, and trusting my future self\n\nI find there’s high switching cost to doing tasks - it disrupts my concentration, and sometimes can open new distractions, eg if I open Messenger. Batching this up once a week reduces the switching costs, and means that when I notice a small task when doing something else, I can just add it to my to-do list and move on\n\nGratitude - Gratitude is one of the few peer-reviewed interventions that genuinely, actually, reliably works to make you happier. But if you’re anything like me, it’s not your default. So set yourself time once a week to notice what you’re grateful for, to make it the default! ( A great post on this )\n\nMore generally, I find it highly valuable to separate planning and doing . I find it much easier to do something concrete, and clearly planned, so I don’t feel the need to waste energy questioning whether what I am doing is worthwhile in the moment. And it’s much easier to plan something, without the imminent prospect of actually doing it forcing me to procrastinate\n\nSo having a first draft of a concrete plan for the next week, can help me become much more focused!\n\nI currently do my weekly review first thing on Saturday morning, and do it by following a Google Form (you can make a copy of my current form here ) - I put in the questions and prompts I want to follow, and then just fill out the form. I am a really, really big fan of Google Forms for things like this - they are a super flexible medium to set an algorithm for my future self, and reduce following that algorithm to just filling out boxes. It creates a super clear default action! When I previously tried things like having a list of questions in a word document, I found it easy to start reordering and skipping questions, and getting easily distracted. And they’re easy to edit, so it’s easy to iterate, remove the bad questions, add new habits to my scaffold, etc.\n\nI swap the questions in the form in and out, depending on what’s currently going on in my life, what I am currently finding useful, etc. But these are the parts I’ve consistently found most useful:\n\nWeekly gratitude practice - I go through my calendar for everyone I talked to this week, notice all the interactions I feel excited-in-hindsight about, write them a thank you note detailing what, specifically, I valued about the interaction, and send it to them\n\nThis is far and away the most fun part of the review, and is one of the points that really helps the habit stick. Of all of my systems, this is one of my strongest recommendations for other people to try! I think we all have a systematic bias about improving the lives of the people we care about , and this is a small way to overcome that\n\nIt significantly improves my mood, by getting me to dwell on all of the awesome people in my life. And, especially, trying to put into words what specific things I liked about what they did, rather than just sending a vague thanks\n\nPeople often seem concerned that this will feel forced, or make other people feel awkward, or make me seem insincere, but I haven’t encountered any of these issues. The key is that the system isn’t about forcing gratitude - the point is to think about things that happened, and only write a message for the ones where I feel sincere gratitude. And people universally react positively to the message\n\nIt’s also really useful! When I eg meet someone new who I really like, sending a thank you message is an excellent way to signal “I like you and would enjoy keeping in touch”. And this remains sincere, because I rarely want to keep in touch with someone I didn’t enjoy talking to\n\nNoticing my biggest bottleneck, and spending 5 minutes trying to solve it\n\nI also do the same for my current Hamming Problem - I think of my biggest bottleneck as a short-term, local problem this week, while my Hamming Problem is my current biggest problem in my life more generally. I find it helpful to both zoom in and zoom out like this\n\nBraindumping whatever is on my mind - what did I talk to people about this week? What felt like the biggest things that happened? What weighed on my mind? This creates a fun record to look back on\n\nFollowing the review with an hour of doing small things on my to-do list, and maintaining my social life\n\nAsking “what am I currently being an idiot about?” - I find this is a surprisingly effective prompt for eg, things I am procrastinating about, people I should be asking for help\n\nTracking progress and successes - what was a win this week? What research progress did I make?\n\nAt this point in the post, I’ve hopefully sketched out what a good regular review could look like. But this kind of thing is also effort - setting up and maintaining a routine is hard in the short-term, and even if it works, it’s a consistent drain on your time. So a natural question is, is it worth your time?\n\nI think that for most people reading this who don’t currently do a regular review, the answer is overwhelmingly yes. If you’re the kind of person who reads this blog, agrees with the core insight that your problems are fixable , and that life could be better, but aren’t sure what to actually do about this, I think this is an excellent place to start. Improving your life isn’t a single flash of inspiration where you realise how to resolve your core problem. It’s a slow, incremental process of noticing problems, trying to fix them, iterating, and slowly making progress. And slow, incremental progress is really powerful in the longterm\n\nWhat success looks like\n\nBut it is not the default. For me, a regular review is a cornerstone habit, upon which I can build everything else. Once I see a mistake, fixing it is comparatively easy, but I need to have a routine that forces me to look for them. One friend of mine claims to have completely turned his life around over the past year, and thinks having a regular review was the core of this. There were always failures, off weeks, and times he just didn’t care enough. But the important part was having a safety net, a routine that always got him to return to caring about things\n\nI expect that for some people this is overkill, but only if you feel like you already do this well enough, without the routine. And I think that that’s pretty rare.\n\nIf, at this point, you feel convinced that this could be a good idea, but feel unsure, then I suggest re-framing this as an experiment ! You’re uncertain about whether regular reviewing is a good idea, and it would be valuable to reduce that uncertainty. Seek upside risk ! Make a plan for a weekly review, and make yourself stick to it for the next 3 weeks. And at the end of that, see whether it felt useful - if it did you can continue doing it and get value over the rest of your life, if it didn’t you can just forget about it, with a bit of time and effort wasted. The benefits massively outweigh the costs. And, at least personally, I find that both the enthusiastic and skeptical parts of me can get behind running an experiment - it reframes the problem from “reviews are definitely awesome” to “I want to reduce my uncertainty”.\n\nFurther, it’s hard to be confident a review would be useless, without trying it. The benefits are slow and incremental, and we have a systematic bias against noticing the benefits of gradual, exponential growth. Especially when it takes time away from my “urgent”, short-term concerns, that I know I rarely care about a month from now. The only way to resolve a bias like this is to go out, gather data, and try things!\n\nAnd finally, the goal is not to have a perfect review the first time, this is something you can always improve and iterate. If there’s a 50% chance any given question is worth doing, you can just delete the half that aren’t useful! I’ve deliberately given a ton of prompts in this post, I expect some to be helpful and some to be irrelevant. And you can resolve this by trying and seeing. The question is not whether you could design an excellent review now, but whether it would be useful after several rounds of iteration, which is much easier. And something you can only figure out by trying and seeing!\n\nOverall, I think regular reviews are extremely valuable. Your life will be full of mistakes, and things that could be better. Your goal is not to avoid this, your goal should be to slowly notice them and then actually do something about it. This is not the default, but you can make it the default. And this can form a cornerstone habit - a source of gradual, incremental growth, a scaffold to peg other things to, a way to notice the wasted motion in your life, and do something about it.\n\nAnd if you’ve gotten to this part of the article, and buy my case that this is worth trying, implement it! I suggest that you set a 5 minute timer right now , and make a start on implementing this routine - pick a time, put it in your calendar, set yourself a reminder, and start to brainstorm good questions.\n\nImagine it’s a month from now, and you’ve never got round to doing a review. Are you surprised by this outcome? If not, what are you going to do about it?","tokenFrequency":{"what":1,"loop":1,"mind":7,"prioritis":2,"enthusiast":1,"mistak":15,"record":2,"random":1,"sacrosanct":1,"posit":2,"review":36,"success":4,"open":3,"valu":3,"anyth":3,"behind":3,"ideal":1,"bog":1,"attach":1,"enjoy":2,"confid":1,"includ":1,"zone":1,"word":2,"stick":4,"refram":2,"etc":5,"minimis":2,"hard":6,"good":10,"happier":1,"net":1,"alway":7,"goal":11,"long":1,"agre":2,"bound":1,"bias":3,"invest":1,"system":4,"mine":2,"compar":1,"experi":5,"outcom":1,"problem":14,"tip":1,"slowli":2,"benefit":4,"they'r":1,"swap":1,"take":7,"check":2,"happen":3,"immin":1,"write":3,"especi":3,"50":1,"easili":1,"research":1,"quick":1,"yes":1,"everyon":1,"reflect":9,"work":8,"high":5,"week”":1,"whether":7,"better":4,"ton":2,"small":4,"recommend":3,"key":9,"flinch":1,"prompt":4,"strongest":1,"month":6,"insight":2,"power":1,"default":13,"react":1,"continu":1,"aren't":2,"intervent":1,"mental":3,"great":3,"thought":2,"prefer":1,"touch":1,"tini":1,"list":5,"wrong":2,"mood":1,"much":8,"one":8,"move":2,"iter":4,"event":1,"data":2,"didn't":4,"worth":6,"disrupt":1,"common":2,"worthi":1,"noth":2,"beemind":1,"accur":1,"eg":7,"past":6,"whatev":4,"day":1,"forev":1,"top":2,"someth":12,"solv":4,"everi":1,"self":3,"deep":1,"let":1,"best":2,"part":7,"spontan":1,"complet":1,"winter":1,"live":1,"reason":2,"reliabl":2,"i'll":2,"buy":1,"calendar":3,"effect":1,"import":6,"forward":1,"final":1,"suggest":5,"abstract":1,"peerreview":1,"get":12,"step":3,"algorithm":2,"practic":2,"decid":1,"crack":1,"medium":1,"cours":1,"there":5,"bit":1,"…":1,"abandon":1,"routin":12,"upon":1,"version":1,"next":5,"week":36,"morn":1,"clear":9,"switch":2,"ham":2,"resolv":3,"alreadi":1,"prioriti":4,"place":1,"know":1,"increment":4,"progress":6,"before”":1,"wast":4,"build":3,"tri":18,"win":1,"you'r":9,"fun":3,"gratitud":6,"easier":8,"far":4,"thing":27,"found":3,"end":3,"even":5,"you'v":3,"forget":2,"separ":1,"want":7,"worthwhil":1,"implement":3,"like":20,"exampl":3,"run":1,"add":2,"“review":1,"fuzzi":1,"focus":2,"upsid":1,"higher":1,"make":32,"design":1,"it":21,"decis":3,"skeptic":1,"away":3,"uncertain":2,"lesson":1,"instead":1,"overkil":1,"liter":1,"remain":2,"univers":1,"improv":6,"box":2,"brainstorm":1,"sever":1,"longer":3,"stop":5,"“urgent”":1,"overal":1,"insincer":1,"point":9,"flash":1,"gradual":2,"exponenti":1,"awkward":1,"enough":2,"outweigh":1,"arrang":2,"flexibl":2,"easiest":1,"sure":1,"tool":1,"tier":1,"whose":1,"ask":10,"half":1,"less":1,"highest":1,"second":1,"excitedinhindsight":1,"cancel":1,"see":4,"notic":14,"question":23,"action":5,"type":1,"post":7,"sometim":2,"systemat":4,"round":2,"short":2,"state":1,"core":4,"creat":2,"look":5,"appropri":1,"momentum":1,"think":20,"trust":2,"feel":20,"averag":1,"super":3,"motion":2,"urgent":1,"issu":1,"pattern":1,"weigh":1,"perfect":2,"habit":7,"anxieti":1,"though":1,"avoid":2,"shortterm":4,"saturday":1,"pick":2,"streak":1,"right":10,"safeti":1,"consid":1,"i'm":4,"difficult":1,"spot":6,"full":3,"chanc":1,"that":1,"project":2,"definit":1,"come":1,"pretti":2,"process":1,"draft":1,"ever":2,"biggest":9,"ensur":1,"dwell":1,"becom":1,"reduc":5,"concern":2,"without":4,"basi":1,"distract":3,"time":23,"fan":1,"implicit":1,"about”":1,"last":1,"financi":1,"signal":1,"assum":1,"futur":7,"moment":3,"mani":3,"blind":6,"track":4,"skip":5,"massiv":1,"surpris":2,"encount":1,"deeper":1,"year":2,"general":3,"messeng":1,"find":21,"chase":1,"turn":1,"thus":1,"extrem":3,"learn":2,"seem":3,"copi":1,"edit":1,"fill":3,"natur":1,"unbound":1,"optimist":1,"achiev":2,"frame":1,"unexpect":1,"note":1,"front":1,"easi":10,"convinc":2,"signific":1,"standard":2,"understand":1,"grate":1,"unsur":1,"case":2,"regular":9,"everyth":2,"local":1,"world":2,"explain":1,"daili":2,"done":2,"failur":1,"prehindsight":1,"articl":1,"someon":6,"overcom":2,"follow":5,"risk":1,"care":5,"site":1,"big":2,"alloc":2,"messag":3,"exercis":1,"social":2,"click":1,"debug":4,"predict":1,"harder":2,"start":8,"fix":3,"back":1,"imagin":1,"buddi":2,"vagu":2,"hindsight":1,"gotten":1,"lot":1,"way":11,"kind":3,"39":1,"miss":6,"given":2,"erod":1,"i'v":3,"commit":1,"consist":3,"throw":1,"bottleneck":5,"also":5,"maintain":3,"often":9,"put":5,"gather":1,"fallaci":1,"idea":4,"mean":1,"“life":1,"penalti":1,"fixabl":1,"singl":1,"collect":1,"concret":5,"“how":1,"absolut":1,"forc":5,"delet":1,"googl":3,"“what":2,"concentr":1,"felt":2,"set":9,"energi":1,"remov":1,"form":8,"seek":1,"expect":3,"fail":3,"happi":1,"obvious":3,"deliber":2,"rather":2,"sourc":1,"overwhelm":1,"around":2,"isn't":3,"option":1,"comfort":2,"useless":1,"well":2,"valuabl":8,"outsid":1,"realis":3,"slow":3,"bad":1,"made":1,"reorder":1,"checkin":1,"friend":4,"fall":1,"life":20,"fine":1,"idiot":2,"stuck":1,"inde":1,"shift":1,"order":1,"underappreci":1,"rare":4,"todo":2,"cornerston":2,"product":3,"minut":3,"interest":1,"procrastin":4,"claim":1,"answer":5,"remind":3,"takeaway":1,"prospect":1,"tempt":1,"could":8,"possibl":1,"first":5,"read":2,"approach":1,"longterm":2,"batch":1,"inspir":1,"peg":2,"hour":2,"braindum

Merge Announcement | Ethereum Foundation Blog","link":"https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/05/30/ropsten-merge-announcement","content":"After years of work to bring proof-of-stake to Ethereum, we are now entering the final testing stage: testnet deployments!\n\nHaving tested client implementations on Kintsugi 🍵 , Kiln 🔥🧱 and many shadow forks , client teams are now ready to run Ropsten – the oldest proof-of-work testnet – through The Merge. In preparation, a Ropsten Beacon Chain has been launched to provide consensus to the network.\n\nAfter the Ropsten transition, two more testnets (Goerli and Sepolia) will be transitioned to proof-of-stake before focus shifts to mainnet. Other testnets, such as Rinkeby and Kovan, may be maintained and upgraded separately by the community but will no longer be monitored by client developers.\n\nThe Merge is different from previous Ethereum upgrades in two ways. First, node operators need to update both their consensus and execution layer clients in tandem, rather than just one of the two. Second, the upgrade activates in two phases: the first at a slot height on the Beacon Chain and the second upon hitting a Total Difficulty value on the execution layer.\n\nGiven these circumstances, the Ropsten network, which is intended to be deprecated after The Merge, will run through the upgrade earlier in the development process than previous network upgrades. This will give the community more time to become familiar with the upgrade process.\n\nNote : Client releases listed below will not be suitable for the Ethereum mainnet’s transition to proof-of-stake.\n\nThe Merge is a two-step process. It starts with a network upgrade on the consensus layer, triggered by a slot height. This is followed by the execution layer’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, triggered by a specific Total Difficulty threshold, called the Terminal Total Difficulty ( TTD ).\n\nOn June 2, 2022 , at slot 24000 , the Bellatrix upgrade will prepare the Ropsten Beacon Chain for The Merge. At that point, CL clients will begin listening for a TTD value to be hit on the proof-of-work chain.\n\nBecause the hash rate of proof-of-work testnets is very volatile, the TTD value will first be set to an exceedingly high value, 100000000000000000000000 . At Ropsten’s current hash rate, it would take ~250 years to reach it.\n\nOnce the Bellatrix upgrade has happened on the Beacon Chain, a new TTD value, which is expected to be reached a few days later, will be chosen and announced. Users will then need to configure their node with this new value. Instructions for doing so with each client are available here .\n\nWhen this new TTD is hit or exceeded on Ropsten, the execution layer part of the transition, codenamed Paris , will start. Again, note that hash rate on Ropsten is notoriously variable, so the actual time at which the Terminal Total Difficulty takes place may fluctuate.\n\nOnce the execution layer has exceeded the TTD , the next block will be solely produced by a Beacon Chain validator. We consider The Merge to have been completed once the Beacon Chain has finalized this block. Assuming normal network conditions, this should happen 2 epochs, or approximately 13 minutes, after the first post-TTD block is hit!\n\nA new JSON-RPC block tag, finalized , returns the latest finalized block or an error if no such post-merge block exists. This tag can be used for applications to check if The Merge has been completed. Similarly, smart contracts can query the DIFFICULTY opcode ( 0x44 ) , renamed to PREVRANDAO post-merge, to determine if The Merge has happened. We recommend infrastructure providers monitor overall network stability in addition to finalization status.\n\nThe following client releases support The Merge on the Ropsten testnet. Node operators must run both an execution and consensus layer client to remain on the network during and after The Merge.\n\nAs mentioned above, the following releases have a hardcoded Terminal Total Difficulty value of 100000000000000000000000 which will need to be manually updated after the Bellatrix upgrade has been activated on the Beacon Chain.\n\nWhen choosing which client to run, validators should be especially mindful of the risks of running a majority client on both the EL and CL. An explainer of these risks and their consequences can be found here . An estimate of current EL and CL client distribution and guides for switching from one client to another can be found here .\n\nNote : if you had previously downloaded a client release with a Ropsten TTD of 43531756765713534 , you must either update your release or manually override the TTD to 100000000000000000000000 as specified here .\n\nLodestar Note: the latest Lodestar release, v0.37.0 , has an outdated Ropsten TTD value of 43531756765713534 . To be compatible with the Ropsten Merge, which now uses a TTD of 100000000000000000000000 , Lodestar users will need to manually override this value. Instructions about doing so can be found on the team’s release announcement post .\n\nGeth Note: the latest go-ethereum (geth) release, Sharblu (v1.10.18) , has an outdated Ropsten TTD value of 43531756765713534 . To be compatible with the Ropsten Merge, which now uses a TTD of 100000000000000000000000 , geth users must either:\n\nConsensus-critical changes for The Merge are specified in two places:\n\nIn addition to these, two other specifications cover how the consensus and execution layer clients interact:\n\nPost-merge, an Ethereum full node will combine a consensus layer client, which runs the proof-of-stake Beacon Chain, and an execution layer client, which manages the user-state and runs the computations associated with transactions. These communicate over an authenticated port using a new set of JSON RPC methods called the Engine API . The EL and CL client authenticate each other using a JWT secret. Node operators should refer to their clients’ documentation for instructions about how to generate and configure these.\n\nIn other words, if you were already running a node on the Beacon Chain, you now also need to run an execution layer client. Similarly, if you were running a node on the current proof-of-work network, you will need to run a consensus layer client. For them to communicate securely, a JWT token must be passed to each client.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that while they are both part of consensus layer client releases, running a Beacon Node is distinct from running a Validator Client. Stakers must run both, but node operators only need the former. This post explains the difference between both components in more detail.\n\nAlso, note that each layer will maintain an independent set of peers and expose its own APIs. The Beacon and JSON RPC APIs will both continue working as expected.\n\nFinally, remember to check back on June 3rd for an announcement on this blog of the final Ropsten TTD value.\n\nAs explained above, validators on the Beacon Chain will need to run an execution layer client after The Merge, in addition to their consensus layer clients. Pre-merge, this was strongly recommended, but validators could have outsourced these functions to third-party providers. This was possible because the only data required on the execution layer were updates to the deposit contract.\n\nPost-merge, validators need to ensure that transactions in blocks that they create and attest to are valid. To do this, each beacon node must be paired with an execution layer client. Note that multiple validators can still be paired to a single beacon node \u0026 execution layer client combo. While this expands validators’ responsibilities, it also gives a validator who proposes a block the right to its associated transaction priority fees (which currently go to miners).\n\nWhile validator rewards accrue on the Beacon Chain and will require a subsequent network upgrade to be withdrawn, transaction fees will continue to be paid, burned, and distributed on the execution layer. Validators can specify any Ethereum address as a recipient for transaction fees.\n\nAfter updating your consensus client, be sure to set the fee recipient as part of your validator client configurations to ensure transaction fees are sent to an address you control.\n\nIf you have staked using a third-party provider, it is up to your selected provider to specify how these fees are allocated.\n\nTestnet upgrades are the last chance for validators to ensure their setups work as expected and resolve issues. Information about running a validator on the Ropsten Beacon Chain in preparation for The Merge can be found on the Ropsten staking launchpad .\n\nWe strongly recommend that mainnet validators run through The Merge on Ropsten and other testnets before the Ethereum mainnet transitions to proof-of-stake.\n\nWith The Merge going live on Ropsten, now is the time to ensure that your product works as expected through the proof-of-stake transition and in a post-merge context. As explained in a previous post , The Merge will have only minimal impact on a subset of contracts deployed on Ethereum, none of which should be breaking. Additionally, the lion’s share of user API endpoints remain stable (unless you use proof-of-work specific methods such as eth_getWork ).\n\nThat said, most applications on Ethereum involve much more than on-chain contracts. Now is the time to ensure that your front-end code, tooling, deployment pipeline and other off-chain components work as intended. We strongly recommend that developers run through a complete testing \u0026 deployment cycle on Ropsten (or Kiln ) and report any issues with tools or dependencies to those projects’ maintainers. If you are unsure where to open an issue, please use this repository .\n\nNo. The Ethereum mainnet is not affected by this testnet. Subsequent announcements will be made on this blog before mainnet’s transition.\n\nNo. If you are mining on the Ethereum mainnet or Ropsten, you should be aware that each network will operate entirely under proof-of-stake after The Merge. At that point, mining will no longer be possible on the network.\n\nThis is expected around June 8, 2022 on Ropsten and later this year for the Ethereum mainnet.\n\nNo. The Merge is the most complicated upgrade to Ethereum to date. To minimize risks of network disruptions, a minimal approach was taken which excluded any non-transition changes from this upgrade.\n\nWithdrawals from the Beacon Chain will likely be introduced in the first upgrade after The Merge. Specifications for both the consensus and execution layers are in progress.\n\nA Merge Community Call is scheduled for June 3, 14:00 UTC. Client developers and researchers will be available to answer questions from node operators, stakers, infrastructure \u0026 tooling providers and community members.\n\nAs of the publication of this post, the date for the Ethereum mainnet proof-of-stake transition has not been set. Any source claiming otherwise is likely to be a scam. Updates will be posted on this blog. Please stay safe!\n\nAssuming no issues are found with Ropsten, once client testing is complete, Ethereum’s other testnets, will run through The Merge. Once Goerli and Sepolia have successfully transitioned and stabilized, a slot height will be chosen for the Bellatrix upgrade on the Beacon Chain and a difficulty value will be set for the mainnet transition. Clients will then make releases that enable The Merge on mainnet. These will be announced on this blog and in other community publications.\n\nThis assumes no issues are found. However, if issues are found at any point in the process or test coverage is judged to be insufficient, these things will be addressed before continuing with the deployment process.\n\nOnly then will it be possible to estimate the exact date for The Merge.","tokenFrequency":{"applic":2,"happen":3,"volatil":1,"implement":1,"day":1,"back":1,"manual":3,"engin":1,"0x44":1,"–":2,"valu":12,"take":2,"research":1,"opcod":1,"estim":2,"separ":1,"second":2,"none":1,"differ":2,"withdrawn":1,"subset":1,"postmerg":5,"outsourc":1,"oldest":1,"mention":1,"twostep":1,"method":2,"give":2,"stage":1,"expect":5,"final":7,"later":2,"transact":6,"full":1,"approxim":1,"could":1,"bellatrix":4,"explain":4,"transit":11,"last":1,"project":1,"emphas":1,"place":2,"pass":1,"complet":4,"around":1,"1400":1,"secret":1,"new":5,"coverag":1,"affect":1,"code":1,"would":1,"enter":1,"approach":1,"v11018":1,"exceed":3,"kiln":2,"consensuscrit":1,"provid":6,"set":6,"layer":21,"staker":2,"beacon":18,"follow":3,"worth":1,"sent":1,"error":1,"call":3,"proofofwork":6,"question":1,"pipelin":1,"hash":3,"former":1,"combo":1,"assum":3,"tag":2,"one":2,"singl":1,"consid":1,"minut":1,"right":1,"return":1,"withdraw":1,"actual":1,"start":2,"creat":1,"generat":1,"public":2,"mine":2,"trigger":2,"test":5,"maintain":3,"date":3,"block":8,"ttd":13,"fork":1,"postttd":1,"premerg":1,"part":3,"intend":2,"geth":3,"2022":2,"miner":1,"year":3,"specif":4,"focus":1,"guid":1,"consensus":11,"overrid":2,"live":1,"mainnet":11,"stabl":1,"launch":1,"specifi":4,"smart":1,"nontransit":1,"determin":1,"must":6,"termin":3,"lion":1,"progress":1,"user":4,"slot":4,"two":6,"phase":1,"post":5,"overal":1,"major":1,"similar":2,"execut":15,"found":7,"secur":1,"context":1,"becom":1,"address":3,"introduc":1,"shadow":1,"propos":1,"reach":2,"alreadi":1,"node":12,"🍵":1,"chanc":1,"comput":1,"rather":1,"member":1,"deploy":5,"high":1,"longer":2,"mind":1,"frontend":1,"thirdparti":2,"threshold":1,"go":2,"success":1,"queri":1,"activ":2,"anoth":1,"network":12,"multipl":1,"use":8,"rpc":2,"condit":1,"json":2,"pleas":2,"jsonrpc":1,"el":3,"offchain":1,"awar":1,"combin":1,"expand":1,"fee":6,"latest":3,"familiar":1,"bring":1,"function":1,"minim":3,"judg":1,"ethgetwork":1,"point":3,"manag":1,"rate":3,"sharblu":1,"unless":1,"goer":2,"open":1,"sepolia":2,"🔥🧱":1,"team":2,"100000000000000000000000":5,"fluctuat":1,"peer":1,"v0370":1,"kintsugi":1,"instruct":3,"note":7,"check":2,"current":4,"tool":3,"said":1,"burn":1,"pair":2,"independ":1,"associ":2,"difficulti":7,"updat":6,"rememb":1,"codenam":1,"endpoint":1,"43531756765713534":3,"cycl":1,"schedul":1,"exclud":1,"remain":2,"configur":3,"announc":5,"process":5,"listen":1,"250":1,"develop":4,"cl":4,"kovan":1,"circumst":1,"ethereum":14,"unsur":1,"begin":1,"ropsten":23,"support":1,"onchain":1,"enabl":1,"exact":1,"sole":1,"tandem":1,"earlier":1,"also":3,"chosen":2,"previous":4,"need":9,"data":1,"select":1,"token":1,"risk":3,"notori":1,"disrupt":1,"distribut":2,"paid":1,"possibl":3,"upgrad":16,"ensur":5,"involv":1,"blog":4,"subsequ":2,"thing":1,"stay":1,"break":1,"like":2,"chain":15,"much":1,"client":33,"pari":1,"detail":1,"outdat":2,"june":4,"sure":1,"repositori":1,"howev":1,"merg":25,"consequ":1,"impact":1,"variabl":1,"first":5,"contract":4,"compon":2,"communic":2,"make":1,"download":1,"total":5,"stabil":2,"choos":1,"utc":1,"interact":1,"exist":1,"prioriti":1,"entir":1,"proofofstak":9,"taken":1,"jwt":2,"upon":1,"13":1,"switch":1,"made":1,"claim":1,"control":1,"24000":1,"deposit":1,"distinct":1,"cover":1,"3rd":1,"answer":1,"recipi":2,"mani":1,"recommend":4,"userst":1,"may":2,"infrastructur":2,"suitabl":1,"authent":2,"":77,"share":1,"document":1,"addit":4,"depend":1,"releas":10,"prevrandao":1,"insuffici":1,"epoch":1,"monitor":2,"shift":1,"complic":1,"otherwis":1,"issu":6,"attest":1,"word":1,"chang":2,"compat":2,"work":5,"scam":1,"still":1,"normal":1,"communiti":5,"inform":1,"expos":1,"list":1,"oper":6,"sourc":1,"requir":2,"either":2,"goethereum":1,"given":1,"stake":2,"report":1,"reward":1,"prepar":3,"produc":1,"setup":1,"especi":1,"rinkebi":1,"testnet":10,"lodestar":3,"product":1,"readi":1,"status":1,"run":19,"avail":2,"api":4,"valid":16,"refer":1,"deprec":1,"port":1,"height":3,"time":4,"accru":1,"resolv":1,"alloc":1,"renam":1,"hardcod":1,"continu":3,"next":1,"respons":1,"hit":4,"launchpad":1,"safe":1,"strong":3,"way":1}},"21086":{"id":"21086","title":"Thinking at the right level of abstraction - taimur.me","link":"https://taimur.me/posts/thinking-at-the-right-level-of-abstraction","content":"In school, I often wasn’t sure when I was allowed to think.\n\nIn many subjects, we learned simplified versions of things. This was necessary, I’m sure, but it made it hard to meaningfully think about those things.\n\nDespite being fascinated by animals and plants (fish, in particular), biology at school never resonated with me. I put this down to the fact that we weren’t really allowed to think in biology. Or rather, we couldn’t really think in biology.\n\nWe were learning about a bunch of things — how photosynthesis works, what the parts of a cell are, how antibodies have particular shapes to “fit” together with antigens. But these all felt like very high level explanations, so much so that we couldn’t really apply any thinking. There was never a scenario in biology where we learned a set of facts from which we could correctly deduce a new fact. Or I couldn’t, at least.\n\nWe were working at too high a level of abstraction, so I never felt like I developed any understanding.\n\nMaths was one of the few subjects that felt at the right level of abstraction — close enough to the metal to be able to exercise some thinking — and I think that’s why I chose to study it at university.\n\nA year into my degree, however, I learned that I’d been thinking at too low a level of abstraction all along.\n\nFor a long time, I thought maths was about manipulating symbols in the right way to get to a result.\n\nThis got me through school, but at university I found it really hard. The turning point was a few weeks before my first-year exams, when I was studying with a friend, Adrien. He seemed to really get the subject. I asked him how he managed to remember so many proofs so effortlessly.\n\n“Well… you just have this picture in your head, right? Then you construct the proof from that.”\n\nUhhh, what? There were no maths pictures in my head, that was for sure.\n\nI asked him to explain one particular theorem I was struggling with — the colourfully named Scenic Viewpoint Theorem: “Every sequence of real numbers has a monotonic subsequence.”\n\nThis says that if I come up with a sequence of numbers, then you’ll always be able to pick, just from that sequence, a new sequence of numbers that only ever increases, or only ever decreases.\n\nHere’s what the formal proof looks like:\n\nThis was one of the most basic proofs in our first-year Analysis course, basic enough for any lay person to understand conceptually. But I struggled with it because, on paper, it had a lot of symbols. Look at the the a k r bit — a subscript within a subscript! So many complicated-looking symbols.\n\nWhen Adrien explained it to me, however, he didn’t use any symbols at all. He drew a picture on the whiteboard, and spoke in simple English (albeit with an endearing French accent) about what was going on. If you heard his explanation, you might not even have guessed we were talking about maths.\n\n(My iPad is out of battery right now — I’ll draw the picture and explain the proof non-mathematically later this week!)\n\nThis blew my mind. But it wasn’t because I finally understood the Scenic Viewpoint Theorem.\n\nIt was because I realised I’d been thinking about maths completely wrong my whole life.\n\nI’d been thinking in terms of markings on a page, when I should have been thinking in terms of pictures in my head — my level of abstraction was too low. I was getting bogged down in the symbols and formalities, while Adrien was thinking at a higher level — one in which he could reason fluently about concepts. I was looking at the trees, while Adrien was seeing the forest.\n\nPart of what it means to really understand something, I think, is to be able to move freely between levels of abstraction as and when you need to.\n\nIn writing the proof for the Scenic Viewpoint Theorem in an exam, I was working at a very low level of abstraction. In explaining the intuition to me with a picture, Adrien was working at a higher level. And if you wanted to draw inspiration from the theorem and apply it to a completely different domain (as you often hear “geniuses” do), you’d be working at a higher level still.\n\nWhen learning something new, I’ve found it’s really useful to hear experts engaging with one-another about the topic. Not to hear what they think — as a novice, a lot of it will go over your head — but to hear how they think, and in particular, the level of abstraction in which they’re working.\n\nThinking is easy. What’s hard is figuring out the right level of abstraction in which to do it.\n\nWell, okay — thinking is hard, too.\n\nthanks for reading!","tokenFrequency":{"like":3,"they'r":1,"mark":1,"oneanoth":1,"want":1,"exercis":1,"allow":2,"monoton":1,"hard":4,"spoke":1,"subsequence”":1,"domain":1,"hear":4,"along":1,"ask":2,"real":1,"reason":1,"go":2,"sequenc":4,"weren't":1,"set":1,"topic":1,"final":1,"see":1,"new":3,"albeit":1,"what":1,"simpl":1,"you'd":1,"anim":1,"accent":1,"much":1,"that”":1,"learn":5,"didn't":1,"paper":1,"despit":1,"result":1,"page":1,"drew":1,"life":1,"analysi":1,"thought":1,"novic":1,"understand":3,"level":12,"draw":2,"math":5,"exam":2,"i'm":1,"cours":1,"firstyear":2,"need":1,"still":1,"i'v":1,"formal":2,"rather":1,"freeli":1,"move":1,"understood":1,"least":1,"realis":1,"high":2,"nonmathemat":1,"time":1,"come":1,"i'd":3,"think":17,"develop":1,"whole":1,"thank":1,"number":3,"engag":1,"might":1,"lot":2,"biolog":4,"read":1,"easi":1,"found":2,"particular":4,"“geniuses”":1,"fact":3,"heard":1,"use":2,"endear":1,"one":4,"fluentli":1,"batteri":1,"antigen":1,"chose":1,"subscript":2,"complet":2,"never":3,"mani":3,"part":2,"basic":2,"shape":1,"simplifi":1,"“fit”":1,"low":3,"reson":1,"later":1,"term":2,"close":1,"turn":1,"year":1,"":25,"conceptu":1,"put":1,"pictur":6,"couldn't":3,"cell":1,"mean":1,"realli":7,"lay":1,"rememb":1,"friend":1,"here":1,"ipad":1,"sure":3,"univers":2,"“well…":1,"construct":1,"even":1,"that":1,"explan":2,"adrien":5,"long":1,"ever":2,"manag":1,"way":1,"studi":2,"got":1,"version":1,"say":1,"meaning":1,"made":1,"effortless":1,"get":3,"differ":1,"photosynthesi":1,"guess":1,"—":11,"decreas":1,"within":1,"alway":1,"it":1,"plant":1,"well":1,"antibodi":1,"inspir":1,"explain":4,"bog":1,"mind":1,"togeth":1,"someth":2,"increas":1,"i'll":1,"wrong":1,"talk":1,"abl":3,"french":1,"felt":3,"scenic":3,"expert":1,"figur":1,"deduc":1,"higher":3,"symbol":5,"necessari":1,"tree":1,"scenario":1,"often":2,"right":5,"manipul":1,"wasn't":2,"school":3,"look":3,"pick":1,"“everi":1,"viewpoint":3,"appli":2,"blew":1,"enough":2,"uhhh":1,"head":4,"metal":1,"proof":6,"write":1,"correct":1,"whiteboard":1,"point":1,"fish":1,"okay":1,"seem":1,"bit":1,"theorem":5,"intuit":1,"forest":1,"work":6,"fascin":1,"name":1,"english":1,"you'll":1,"howev":2,"subject":3,"person":1,"week":2,"abstract":8,"degre":1,"could":2,"struggl":2,"colour":1,"bunch":1,"complicatedlook":1,"thing":3,"concept":1}},"26264":{"id":"26264","title":"We left the camp singing - by Shaun Usher - Letters of Note","link":"https://news.lettersofnote.com/p/we-left-the-camp-singing?s=r","content":"Each Monday, from July 1942 to September 1944, a long and empty train would slowly snake towards the Dutch village of Westerbork and pull into its overcrowded transit camp. 24 hours later, having been filled with more than a thousand Jews of all ages, that same train would head for one of three Nazi concentration camps in occupied Poland where its powerless passengers were soon to be killed—some immediately upon arrival. 28-year-old Etty Hillesum worked voluntarily at Westerbork, offering support to those awaiting deportation; hours before writing this letter to her friend, she officially become an internee herself. Two months later, Etty, her brother Mischa, and their parents finally boarded the train to Auschwitz. All were eventually murdered.\n\nEtty spent much of the time eloquently describing her experience in diaries and letters, many of which she passed to Maria Tuinzing (the recipient of this particular missive) before her departure from Westerbork. Her final note, written to a family friend, was thrown from the train and found by a farmer who sent it on. In it, Etty said, “We left the camp singing.” That note can be read along with her other writing in the book, An Interrupted Life: the Diaries and Letters of Etty Hillesum 1941-43.\n\nTen thousand have passed through this place, the clothed and the naked, the old and the young, the sick and the healthy—and I am left to live and work and stay cheerful. It will be my parents’ turn to leave soon, if by some miracle not this week, then certainly one of the next. And I must learn to accept this as well. Mischa insists on going along with them, and it seems to me that he probably should; if he has to watch our parents leave this place, it will totally unhinge him. I shan’t go, I just can’t. It is easier to pray for someone from a distance than to see him suffer by your side. It is not fear of Poland that keeps me from going along with my parents, but fear of seeing them suffer. And that, too, is cowardice.\n\nThis is something people refuse to admit to themselves: at a given point you can no longer do, but can only be and accept. And although that is something I learned a long time ago, I also know that one can only accept for oneself and not for others. And that’s what is so desperately difficult for me here. Mother and Mischa still want to “do,” to turn the whole world upside down, but I know we can’t do anything about it. I have never been able to “do” anything; I can only let things take their course and, if need be, suffer. This is where my strength lies, and it is great strength indeed. But for myself, not for others.\n\nMother and Father have definitely been turned down for Barneveld ; we heard the news yesterday. They were also told to be ready to leave here on next Tuesday's transport. Mischa wanted to rush straight to the commandant and call him a murderer. We’ll have to watch him carefully. Outwardly, Father appears very calm. But he would have gone to pieces in a matter of days in these vast barracks if I hadn’t been able to have him taken to the hospital—which he is gradually coming to find just as intolerable. He is really at his wits’ end, though he tries not to show it. My prayers, too, aren’t going quite right. I know: you can pray God to give people the strength to bear whatever comes. But I keep repeating the same prayer: “Lord, make it as short as possible.” And as a result I am paralysed. I would like to pack their cases with the best things I can lay my hands on, but I know perfectly well that they will be stripped of every­ thing; about that we have been left in no doubt. So why bother?\n\nI have a good friend here. Last week he was told to keep himself in readiness for transport. When I went to see him, he stood straight as an arrow, face calm, rucksack packed beside his bed. We didn’t mention his leaving, but he did read me various things he had written, and we talked a little philosophy. We didn’t make things hard for each other with grief about having to say good-bye. We laughed and said we would see each other soon. We were both able to bear our lot. And that’s what is so desperate about this place: most people are not able to bear their lot, and they load it onto the shoulders of others. And that burden is more likely to break one than one’s own.\n\nYes, I feel perfectly able to bear my lot, but not that of my parents. This is the last letter I’ll be allowed to write for a while. This afternoon our identity cards were taken away, and we became official camp inmates. So you’ll have to have a little patience waiting for news of me.\n\nPerhaps I will be able to smuggle a letter out now and then.

A Black Google engineer was confronted by a white co-worker demanding to see his ID badge. A Latino project manager pointed out his quickly growing start-up was almost all white, and the chief executive responded by telling him to invite his friends to apply for jobs. A Black Air Force vet was offered positions at both Twitter and Snap, only to be set adrift both times when the recruiting programs that brought him there dissolved. A Black programmer on contract was denied a full-time job and asked to train her unqualified white replacement instead.\n\nThese are just some of the stories of discrimination against women, LGBTQ-identified people, and people of color that The Times has collected in a survey of 68 tech workers that began in the fall of 2019.\n\nPublic protests demanding justice for Black people killed by police have brought a reckoning to the business world, with executives forced to resign , companies overhauling internal policies and employees quitting in protest .\n\nFor the tech industry, this reckoning has been going on in some form since 2014 . But while large tech and venture capital firms have promised to do better, little has changed in how Black people and other people of color are treated as job candidates, employees and investors.\n\nSome of the common experiences detailed in survey responses: enduring daily microaggressions; feeling targeted by superiors or external critics; being trotted out to defend a company’s diversity practices; being tasked with extra work typically reserved for diversity and inclusion officers. Respondents described companies where people of color are severely underrepresented in both rank-and-file and executive roles and corporate cultures that can feel hostile to anyone who is not a heterosexual, cisgender white male.\n\nOf the 68 tech workers who responded to the survey, half said they felt tech was not inclusive to people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nTech companies are famous for moving fast. Yet despite calling diversity a priority since 2014, they remain mostly white and mostly male.\n\n“Tech is inclusive because they need our talent and manpower regardless of whether they acknowledge it or not,” one Hulu employee who asked not to be named said. “It’s a spectrum of tolerance and acceptance.”\n\nPeople whose identities are underrepresented in their field find themselves judged through a different set of lenses, one that ignores the question of privilege, the Hulu employee said. “A single mom that didn’t go to college is seen as uneducated whereas a white college dropout is seen as a ‘genius,’ as if he’s too good for college.”\n\nDespite the hardships of navigating largely white, male spaces, fewer than a third of respondents said they’ve ever left a company in response to discrimination or non-inclusiveness. “When your position is this tenuous, you rarely leave since the next job is never sure to be there,” said one woman who works at an education-tech start-up and asked to be anonymous.\n\nThese experiences mirror the results of a Pew Research study from early 2018 , which found that more than 60% of Black people in STEM fields said they had experienced discrimination at work, as had 50% of women, 44% of Asian STEM workers and 42% of Latino people. Pew found that discrimination typically took one of eight forms: being denied a promotion, being turned down for a job, being passed over for important assignments, experiencing repeated slights at work (or microaggressions), receiving less support from above than co-workers, getting paid less than co-workers doing the same job, feeling isolated, and being treated as less than competent.\n\nThe stories shared with The Times both capture and transcend those neat categories. Drawn from dozens of interviews, these accounts reflect the experiences, both common and unique, of women, LGBTQ-identifying people, and people of color who work in tech.\n\nIfeoma Ozoma, former public policy and social media impact manager at Pinterest\n\nIn October 2019, Pinterest came under pressure from the civil rights activist group Color of Change to stop promoting and romanticizing former slave plantations as wedding venues. The group found an ally in Ifeoma Ozoma, at the time a public policy and social impact manager at the company.\n\n“I agree with them on this — completely,” Ozoma wrote in an email notifying her team about the letter from Color of Change.\n\nThe company’s decision two months later to limit the reach of plantation wedding content received considerable press coverage . In a public statement, a company spokesperson thanked Color of Change for bringing attention to “this disrespectful practice.” But privately, Ozoma was chastised.\n\nIn a performance review, her manager said she should have listed multiple options with pros and cons for each. He accused her of “channeling” the company to her preferred outcome.\n\n“I was supposed to, as a Black woman, provide pros for promoting slave plantations,” Ozoma said.\n\nThe episode was part of a pattern in which Ozoma and her colleague Aerica Banks felt isolated for calling out what they saw as problems for the company and its employees. Early in her tenure, Ozoma felt forced to hire an outside lawyer after her supervisors refused to acknowledge the company practice of paying employees of color less and placing them lower than their responsibilities merited. Ozoma and Banks were among those employees; their manager maintained the outward appearance that the three were co-equals within their department while heaping them with responsibilities and controlling their pay and advancement. Ozoma said despite making up “two-thirds of the entire company’s public policy team” and “leading the whole U.S. government relations portfolio” they were placed and paid in levels for “mid-entry-level employees.”\n\nAerica Banks, founder of Shisu LLC and a former public policy and social impact manager at Pinterest\n\nOn another occasion, Ozoma was forced to hire private security after being doxxed — her personal information published across the internet — in retaliation for Pinterest’s crackdown on medical misinformation. Banks, who had a long career in policy at Google and in the White House before joining the company, warned Pinterest’s management of the doxxing threat, only to be ignored and chastised for criticizing the way another team was handling the issue.\n\nIn a separate incident, Banks, who is Black and Japanese, reported their shared manager for making unsolicited remarks about her ethnic heritage, only to be told the remarks carried “no negative connotations.”\n\nBoth Banks and Ozoma left Pinterest in May 2020. After the company issued a statement of solidarity with the Black community on June 15, both women tweeted about their issues with unfair pay and leveling. On June 17, Pinterest Chief Executive Ben Silbermann said the company is planning to hire an outside firm to review its compensation practices “starting with people of color.”\n\nOn June 17, Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said the company would put an end to a long-standing practice of directing employees to police their own colleagues and seek out “unauthorized visitors” by checking their badges. “We have realized this process is susceptible to bias,” Pichai wrote in the announcement .\n\nFor Leslie Miley, a former engineering director at Google and a Black man who had twice been physically stopped by co-workers when entering company offices, the move was a long time coming.\n\nIn September 2019, Miley rode an elevator in Google’s New York office with a white male co-worker. Miley’s employee badge was on his right hip, visible to the man, who stood to his right. The two exited the elevator into a small lobby giving onto a security door. Miley allowed his co-worker to swipe his badge and enter first. As Miley badged in, the man attempted to push the door shut behind him.\n\n“I stick my hand out and walk in the door,” Miley said. “The person’s like, ‘Can I see your badge?’”\n\nMiley ignored him and walked away but the man pursued him and waved his hand in Miley’s face, demanding to see his badge. The man then blocked Miley’s way and chest bumped him, according to Miley. Finally, he grabbed Miley’s badge, which was still hooked up to his hip, and asked why he didn’t just show it to him.\n\n“I’m looking like, Why did you just initiate physical contact with me?’” Miley recalled. “He said, ‘We need to make sure that people belong here.’”\n\nMiley and others have pointed out the hazards of racist employee policing to Pichai and other Google higher-ups. “I have emails that repeat the exact words that Sundar said [in Wednesday’s statement,]” Miley, who left Google in the fall of 2019, said. “It’s such a pernicious activity that is so easily weaponized. You’ve known about this, it shouldn’t even be an issue anymore.”\n\nTo Miley, the use of employee policing was of a piece with other policies that encouraged and institutionalized discrimination and racism. “They’re racist policies,” Miley said. “And they haven’t changed them.” And the fixes Pichai announced, including a $175-million fund to support Black business owners, founders and the rest of the community, are simply not enough.\n\n“I don’t want a hundred-million-dollar commitment,” he said. “I don’t want a dollar figure attached to me. I want sustained investment in a community that you have ignored and I would like companies to admit they have ignored these communities.”\n\nBrennan Lawson, a Black Air Force veteran, got his first job in the tech industry at West L.A. tech company Snap in early 2018. Snap had created a program to help veterans find roles in the company. A number of tech companies have pledged to hire veterans or established similar programs.\n\nBefore Snap, Lawson applied to one at Twitter in 2016. After extending a verbal offer, the company never followed up, and he learned through the senior employee who referred him that the company had scrapped the program. Twitter said it regretted Lawson’s experience.\n\nAt Snap, the veteran fellowship was “very, very poorly run,” Lawson said.\n\nThe program was barely marketed; Lawson, who was the only member of his cohort, heard about it through word of mouth. There was little structure: Lawson identified a team he wanted to work for and constructed his own role. The company would continually grant short extensions of three to six months to fellows, instead of offering them permanent positions outright, Lawson said. Snap’s then-head of Global Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives Jarvis Sam, who ran the program, left the company midway through Lawson’s fellowship.\n\nAfter six months, Lawson left Snap for a job at Facebook because of the instability. After leaving, he learned the fellowship program had been discontinued.\n\nDiversity programs are usually “just a person with an initiative and you’re lucky if they happen to stay long enough to see it through.”\n\nLawson got his Facebook job through an organization called BreakLine, which provides career transition programs for veterans. He joined the company with about a dozen other veterans. He said there’s a broad sense that big tech companies are difficult to break into for underrepresented groups unless they have an advocate on the inside, or there’s a concerted effort to create a pipeline to a community.\n\nFacebook, like Snap, has a chief diversity officer. These titles provide a sort of cover for the companies, Lawson said.\n\n“You see the title ‘chief diversity officer’ and it’s like, Oh wow, like they must take this really, really seriously, because there are not many companies that have someone running a diversity initiative who is sitting at the executive table. But in reality it may not be.”\n\nBari Williams, now the head of legal at Human Interest, is an Oakland native and UC Berkeley graduate, and has held high-level positions at Facebook, StubHub and the AI company All Turtles. Still, as a Black woman, she is asked if she got into Berkeley through an affirmative action program. “My husband got asked if he got into college on a basketball scholarship,” Williams said. Her husband, Jaime Williams , is a product manager at Google and previously held roles as the director of engineering at past companies. He doesn’t play basketball.\n\n“With microaggressions, there’s no there there so you can’t go to HR,” Williams said. “And HR is a last resort [for women of color] because it’ll give someone something to retaliate against you for. ... It puts a target on your back.”\n\nAnother regular experience: tone policing. In one case, Williams recalled asking a colleague who was not on the legal team not to edit documents she was working on. Another colleague who was white and male had made the same request just days before. But when Williams did it the person complained that she “wasn’t being nice” and was aggressive.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Williams and many of her Black colleagues have had to compartmentalize the stress and pain of Floyd’s killing and the fact that she has to explain why people are protesting and the reality of being Black in the United States to her young son.\n\n“Everybody had a moment in the last two weeks where we’re like, ‘Oh man, I really want to just call out Black,” she said. “And you can’t because somebody is still expecting you to hop on that Zoom call the next day and talk about what you watched on Netflix last night, even though nobody cares, like literally nobody. It’s not comfortable, but you have to do it.”\n\nThe burden was placed on me.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, where the population is nearly 50% Latino, a project manager at a quickly growing start-up, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, recalled being one of only three Latino people at his company. “I raised the point to executives once we were at about 70 to a hundred employees that there were still only two or three Latinx people working at [the company],” he said. “Rather than say we should do more because here we are in Southern California and only like 3% of the employees are Hispanic, the response I got was, Well who do you know? You should ask your friends to apply.\n\n“The burden was placed on me and the expectation was that if me and other people who are minorities had an issue with it we should use our networks to find people,” he said.\n\nAccording to him companies chalk up the lack of diversity to a pipeline problem and then “they just kind of throw their hands up.” He said, in his experience, often tech companies’ only interest is to make money and grow. “And anything that doesn’t do that, it’s like, then why are we paying attention to it?”\n\n“There’s a point at which it doesn’t really matter what your intent is, the outcomes are unjust,” he said.\n\nLike many who responded to our survey, a career IT professional who identifies as half Black and half Hispanic (and who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation) is haunted by the suspicion that he was denied a promotion because of his race.\n\n“I was in a position many years ago where the position above me opened up, and I expressed to my boss, to the big boss, the next level above that, that I was going to apply for the position,” he said. His boss suggested that he help out on the search committee instead. When he pushed back and said he wanted to apply for the job himself, his boss was unequivocal. “He directly told me: I can’t tell you not to apply for this job, but I can tell you that I don’t think this job is for you.”\n\nHe debated what to do with his spouse and his friends, and decided to join the search committee in the end, fearful that his boss would retaliate and hurt his career if he continued to be a squeaky wheel. He had seen it happen to Black co-workers in the past — frozen out or pushed out after speaking up.\n\n“I figured better to be on the inside and be in a position to essentially get to choose my boss than to set myself up for an adversarial situation,” he said. “But I will say that after that search, I found myself thinking that I could and would have done a better job in that role than the person who got it. And the person who got it was a white man.”\n\nFor Jordan Mann, who has spent the last 10 years working as a virtual reality and visual effects specialist in Los Angeles, the problems often start as soon as she walks in the door.\n\n“When I don’t send a picture with my resume, they assume I’m a white man because of my name,” Mann said. On the occasions that she’s called in for an interview without a phone conversation first, the shock is palpable. “It’s like this jolt, they look surprised,” Mann said. “To me right even there that’s bias — why would you be surprised a Black woman is coming through the door?”\n\nIf she’s hired, she says, she faces constant undermining from peers and supervisors alike. “I can’t really think of any space I’ve been in where it wasn’t assumed that someone was smarter than me,” Mann said. “People, speaking generally of non-Black people, always make the assumption that I don’t know how to code, that I don’t have any tech skills, that I got a job because of affirmative action, it’s just ridiculous.”\n\nShe has seen white peers who began at the same position at a fast-growing virtual reality start-up get promoted up the ladder, while she got pushed out. And once at a different firm, when she thought she was actually getting a permanent job rather than a contract position, things went sideways as soon as she tried to negotiate her salary.\n\n“I countered, and then all of a sudden they rescinded the job offer,” Mann said.\n\nIn the end, she was asked to train the white man who was hired for the full-time position, who she said had no experience with the software suite necessary for the job, and then was let go.\n\nHer current employer is the first out of dozens that she says has “actually been respectful and cares about inclusion,” and she credits the company’s leadership for that distinction.\n\nBut she thinks that people in the tech and entertainment industry — whether white or non-Black people of color — need to start examining how they treat their Black peers and supporting them when they speak up about discrimination.\n\n“A lot of people don’t even realize how they don’t treat other people like they’re human,” Mann said. “Senior staff needs to educate their employees, and really draw a line: If someone is harassing based on race or ethnicity or anything like that, address it.”\n\nWhen Jessica Cooper moved back to the L.A. area from Washington, D.C., and got a job at the Santa Monica tech company PatientPop, she was shocked at how white the company — and the company’s leadership — was.\n\nAt the Federal Communications Commission, where she had worked in IT, Cooper said, she never felt isolated in her workplace. “Now that I’ve come back home, and working in the tech industry specifically,” Cooper said, “the higher up the ladder you look, you don’t see a lot of women, and you mostly see white males.” On her team, she’s the only Black woman out of 25 employees. The company’s C-suite consists of four white men and one white woman, and the broader leadership includes just one Black executive.\n\nStarting in the summer of 2019, she and her co-workers formed a group to advocate for more diversity and inclusion at the company. She’s grateful that the company has let them do that work on company time, but the last six months had been frustrating, she said.\n\n“I was hopeful at that time,” when she started the group, she said, “but between that time and when the world changed as we know it, there was this frustration, because as much as we felt like we’re fighting for change it seems like business was really prioritized over that.”\n\n“For people who don’t see a need for this, they’re like, ‘No, let’s just keep making money,’” she added. “The wheels are oiled, so let’s keep going.”\n\nBut things are beginning to change. After the killing of Floyd and the spread of protests around the country, she’s been pleasantly surprised to see the reaction from her company’s C-suite. Although they were a little slow to move at first, she said, they’ve been working with employees like her to actively hammer out new processes and policies.\n\nThe company, which provides online services to medical practices, has seen a decrease in revenue from the COVID-19 crisis, and announced layoffs in early April. That’s put a damper on the potential for change, Cooper said, and has made her group’s core demand of hiring a full-time diversity-and-inclusion executive unlikely to succeed. But the company has been willing to move on a number of changes, such as allowing staff to observe a wider range of significant holidays, and broadening the company’s policy against discrimination and harassment to extend beyond working hours to all interactions between employees.\n\n“We realize we’re in a recession, and COVID is still going on,” Cooper said. “But I’m trying to seize the opportunity to get as much accomplished as possible.”\n\nGoogle, Pinterest and Snap all declined to comment on the accounts offered here by former employees.","tokenFrequency":{"sundar":2,"career":5,"regret":1,"“now":1,"distinct":1,"“senior":1,"tech":16,"race":2,"found":4,"“a":2,"jarvi":1,"let":4,"heterosexu":1,"10":1,"brought":2,"compani":46,"place":4,"stick":1,"educationtech":1,"accus":1,"60":1,"kill":3,"level":3,"sort":1,"sam":1,"graduat":1,"deni":3,"dropout":1,"reaction":1,"slave":2,"tenur":1,"comment":1,"she":5,"content":1,"pinterest":8,"request":1,"offic":5,"skill":1,"mann":6,"“veri":1,"hous":1,"privileg":1,"unqualifi":1,"ever":1,"color”":1,"most":3,"demand":4,"send":1,"two":4,"way":2,"time”":1,"spectrum":1,"medic":2,"maintain":1,"position”":1,"ran":1,"can't":4,"ask":12,"refer":1,"titl":2,"whole":1,"no":1,"face":2,"stem":2,"case":1,"activ":2,"oh":2,"began":2,"“the":4,"respond":5,"acceptance”":1,"much":2,"surprised”":1,"lawyer":1,"secur":2,"felt":5,"figur":2,"college”":1,"made":2,"resort":1,"shouldn't":1,"they'r":2,"train":2,"silbermann":1,"effort":1,"seem":1,"replac":1,"talk":1,"realli":7,"grab":1,"fast":1,"word":2,"jolt":1,"limit":1,"regardless":1,"human":1,"googl":9,"protest":4,"walk":3,"assumpt":1,"oil":1,"ozoma":11,"network":1,"higherup":1,"—":9,"construct":1,"specifically”":1,"talent":1,"uc":1,"septemb":1,"onto":1,"anyon":1,"action":2,"oakland":1,"uniqu":1,"direct":2,"came":1,"swipe":1,"broader":1,"70":1,"tenuous":1,"possible”":1,"we":1,"will":1,"almost":1,"good":1,"work":14,"didn't":2,"“tech":1,"latinx":1,"lower":1,"sustain":1,"choos":1,"ladder":2,"role":5,"exact":1,"policies”":1,"servic":1,"decis":1,"unless":1,"fund":1,"allow":2,"categori":1,"experi":7,"facebook":4,"shut":1,"past":2,"hope":1,"white":20,"crisi":1,"sinc":3,"away":1,"practic":5,"list":1,"candid":2,"prefer":1,"wednesday":1,"broad":1,"instead":4,"refus":1,"other":1,"find":3,"adversari":1,"squeaki":1,"push":4,"pernici":1,"“midentrylevel":1,"“there":1,"los":2,"latino":4,"thank":1,"former":5,"young":1,"rare":1,"investor":1,"unit":1,"softwar":1,"big":2,"commiss":1,"ignor":5,"entir":1,"similar":1,"“with":1,"doxx":2,"hostil":1,"“mi":1,"may":2,"feel":3,"wrote":2,"visibl":1,"email":2,"month":4,"ethnic":2,"badg":7,"countri":1,"necessari":1,"“wasn't":1,"collect":1,"block":1,"boss":6,"me”":1,"start":4,"pursu":1,"genius":1,"“just":1,"suit":1,"llc":1,"judg":1,"male":5,"mirror":1,"husband":2,"remain":1,"grant":1,"tone":1,"moment":1,"“when":2,"paid":2,"heritag":1,"brennan":1,"justic":1,"reflect":1,"up”":1,"somebodi":1,"crackdown":1,"fellow":1,"whether":2,"happen":2,"“twothird":1,"con":1,"“but":3,"black":22,"decreas":1,"door”":2,"reckon":2,"name”":1,"statement”":1,"help":3,"nonblack":2,"global":1,"still":5,"check":1,"peopl":24,"cohort":1,"structur":1,"“and":4,"piec":1,"detail":1,"forc":5,"specialist":1,"like":18,"surpris":2,"insid":2,"twice":1,"vet":1,"repeat":2,"firm":3,"attempt":1,"organ":1,"cover":1,"give":2,"forward":1,"anyth":2,"summer":1,"lens":1,"comfort":1,"use":2,"member":1,"he":1,"want":6,"instabl":1,"csuit":2,"held":2,"new":2,"people”":1,"supervisor":2,"berkeley":2,"monica":1,"colleg":3,"within":1,"california":1,"venu":1,"“actual":1,"realiz":3,"holiday":1,"receiv":2,"extra":1,"negoti":1,"diversityandinclus":1,"“rather":1,"retali":5,"ai":1,"pictur":1,"actual":1,"fact":1,"we'r":3,"bias":1,"connotations”":1,"alway":1,"home":1,"outward":1,"across":1,"spent":1,"name":1,"take":1,"there":3,"publish":1,"prioriti":1,"busi":3,"“i'm":1,"cowork":8,"hour":1,"smarter":1,"damper":1,"compens":1,"account":2,"plantations”":1,"industri":4,"weapon":1,"that”":1,"wheel":2,"move":5,"tweet":1,"someon":4,"care":2,"onlin":1,"activist":1,"":80,"higher":1,"hurt":1,"quit":1,"wow":1,"around":1,"cooper":5,"“for":1,"famous":1,"portfolio”":1,"“we":2,"you”":1,"outcom":2,"ridiculous”":1,"doesn't":3,"belong":1,"jordan":1,"employees”":1,"“channeling”":1,"join":3,"miley":16,"popul":1,"import":1,"examin":1,"layoff":1,"shisu":1,"number":2,"they'v":2,"hardship":1,"recal":3,"fear":3,"misinform":1,"here'”":1,"educ":1,"coequal":1,"nativ":1,"internet":1,"consist":1,"told":2,"team":5,"enter":2,"company”":1,"enough":2,"sideway":1,"lack":1,"jaim":1,"legal":2,"adrift":1,"review":2,"grate":1,"practice”":1,"that":2,"bias”":1,"discrimin":7,"address":1,"santa":1,"show":1,"coverag":1,"episod":1,"man":8,"threat":1,"constant":1,"team”":1,"2019":5,"thought":1,"fellowship":3,"appli":6,"ago":1,"don't":10,"got":11,"come":3,"background":1,"easili":1,"support":3,"air":2,"better":3,"rankandfil":1,"veteran":6,"washington":1,"experienc":2,"pain":1,"whose":1,"depart":1,"though":1,"third":1,"virtual":2,"nice”":1,"notifi":1,"rest":1,"declin":1,"see":9,"black”":1,"son":1,"divers":11,"edit":1,"report":1,"pichai":4,"handl":1,"aerica":2,"common":2,"respons":5,"“peopl":1,"admit":1,"pros":2,"advanc":1,"littl":3,"soon":2,"document":1,"uneduc":1,"scrap":1,"intern":1,"affirm":2,"lot":2,"leadership":3,"extern":1,"creat":2,"regular":1,"underrepres":3,"space":2,"heap":1,"target":2,"respect":1,"liter":1,"“it":3,"midway":1,"sens":1,"question":1,"core":1,"interest":2,"“lead":1,"three":4,"west":1,"plan":1,"among":1,"typic":2,"it":4,"need":5,"usual":1,"covid19":1,"

beautiful, I just don't always see it - by Ava","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/its-beautiful-i-just-dont-always?s=r","content":"I’m preparing an application that requires me to compile pictures from the past two years, and it’s made me realize that 1) I have a really nice life and 2) I don’t enjoy it nearly as much as I should because I’m a perfectionist who likes to be in control. Historically, I’ve always been like what’s going to happen, what’s going to happen, what’s going to happen? I never trust that anything will be okay.\n\nFor ex: someone really liking you is a good and joyous thing, right? Well, I personally have always reacted by being super alarmed. Like: why does he like me? What’s going to go wrong? Can I trust him? My instinct is to try to scramble for control. I’m a paranoid person by nature. Luckily, paranoia and fixation are great for optimization. I think about problems and their solution a lot, circling around potential blind spots and failure points. Everything is mapped out in flow charts—I’m gunning for Plan A but totally prepared for Plan C. And working out D and E and F. I like this about my brain, the way it always searches for answers.\n\nBut it’s weird to reconcile the analytical part of me with the curious, process-oriented part. A recent thought: Life is not the pure expression of will, it’s the pure expression of flow. And I do think that I’ve gotten better at relinquishing control. But I also think people who are control freaks tend to seek out situations where they feel in control. So for me, the question is, when I’m actually very uncertain, can I still be present and accepting?\n\nI think art and love are both lead to great uncertainty. Because you can never know, really. For me, the hardest part of writing a book has been accepting that surrender is a critical part of making art. When I was 40% of the way through I kept thinking: can I finish it? Is it bad? What should I do if it’s bad?\n\nWords started pouring out of me when I stopped worrying about what I should say and focused on what I wanted to say. To do that I had to accept who I am and I want instead of superimposing who I should be on top of that. A character’s aspirations need to be contrasted with their current state—seeing the humor in the gap makes writing possible for me.\n\nI was rereading The Gift of Our Compulsions and I really like what Mary O’Malley wrote about accepting vs dominating:\n\nWe try to deny, dominate, annihilate, or run from our compulsions and the feelings that fuel them, only to have both roar back with a force that astounds us. We have lived with this dynamic long enough now to see that what we try to control controls us. Our very resistance to our compulsions, along with our hatred and fear of all the feelings behind them, fuels what we are trying to resist.\n\nI’ve noticed throughout my life that change follows acceptance. It’s only when I fully accept where a desire comes from that the desire shrinks, twists, changes. Otherwise it just grows larger and larger, following me like a shadow.\n\nThe biggest way I’ve surrendered in the past lol couple years is by letting go of my anxiety. And I had a lot of anxiety to let go of. Part of that was the overt always-worrying-about-worst-case scenarios part of it. But another part was the general tension that bled into everything. I’ve always been so tense. And the tension has been useful maybe 5% of the time. But it bled in the other 95%. It’s like looking down and realizing you’ve been white-knuckling what you assumed was a terrifying roller coaster ride when it was actually a gorgeous scenic drive. And now you’re like, wait lol, I didn’t even bother to look around.\n\nThat’s me: I’m learning how to reconcile the perfection-seeking, beauty-seeking part of my brain with the part that knows everything is already beautiful. I look back now and see that each day of writing was beautiful. Each day of being in love was beautiful. And being heartbroken was beautiful too. I wished I’d relaxed into it more, knowing that everything changes, not letting the present moment slide by so easily. I don’t always see the beauty but it’s always there. To lose something meant you had it for some brief flash of time. We should be grateful for what we given. We should make note of it, write it down, examine it carefully.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

So, I guess there’s no right answer on what to do if you’re young and ambitious. But I tried to pull out some of the common, recurring themes in the below. Maybe the only universal truth is that there are many valid paths to a good outcome :)\n\nMost young people underestimate the probability of doing highly impactful work. If you start early, the odds are in your favor. A standard trajectory will yield standard results - what should you do to achieve outlier impact?\n\nLearn a lot about fields that speak to you\n\nLearn how to manage yourself\n\nGet obsessed with a topic\n\nThis is the best time in your life to accumulate as much knowledge as possible. You might ask, ‘in what fields’? Find what you enjoy. Find ideas that make you so excited you can’t sleep. If a field does not yet exist around an idea you’re particularly drawn to, that might be a very good sign.\n\nQuestion everything\n\nIsaac Newton’s Cambridge notebooks ( freely available online ) from his Annus Mirabilis and age 21-23 are excellent in this regard. He has a page (list of topics here ) with very silly sounding questions. He is 21, alone in his college dormitory, and obsessively covering notebooks with questions like ‘what is heat?’, ‘why do things stick together?’, ‘what is light?’.\n\nLearn to think original thoughts. Nurture your curiosity. Most people don’t know how most things are defined or work, and most of the answers you have been given in this regard start to fall apart when you really poke at them. To test this, try asking an adult why the sky is blue or how planes fly.\n\nThe obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply. Grothendiek (one of the most famous and influential mathematicians of the 20th century) famously became completely confused in college by what a teacher meant by ‘volume’. This is a simple concept everyone learns in high school. Grothendiek was completely confused by the explanation most high school students accept as rote. He subsequently made some of the most important mathematical advances in the 20th century. Learn to be very skeptical when everyone talks about something as though it is obvious - few things in science are, at their core.\n\nStart a notebook. Write down all of your ideas, particularly your questions.\n\nWork on a project, you have more time now than you ever will.\n\nSay you are 14, and plan to go to college at 18. You have 4-5 years, an equivalent length of time to many graduate students or postdocs. Use this time to pick a significant project and make real progress.\n\nThe free time you have now is valuable. If you are unschooled, your time is even completely your own. You can spend 40+ hours a week learning and doing original research. For some, only a few hours a day will suffice. When you go to college, you will lose this free time.\n\nPick one project and work on it for at least one year. Pick a research question appropriate for a graduate rotation student in a lab, if applicable. Discriminate between projects ‘for show’ and work that you truly find good and original.\n\nTo get started quickly, find subjects that don’t require spending money or buying expensive equipment, such as writing, math and programming.\n\nIf you want to work on something which requires a biology or chemistry lab, it may take ~6 months. Be persistent. Email every scientist you can find with a concise note describing your interest in their research, and you may find one who will help you. Do whatever it takes to get to the lab. Make it your personal mission to leave the lab every day with one person very glad you were there. Ask as many questions as possible.\n\nFind and cultivate mentors\n\nFind the best person in your field. Grill them relentlessly on which problems they find interesting. Outstanding experts can suggest problems that are perfect next intellectual steps for you. See Erdos and Terrance Tao .\n\nShow your mentors that your interest is real. Experts commonly encounter young people who just want to win competitions or get into a good college. They may assume that is why you are talking to them. If you can convince a great scientist of your genuine interest, you will have the ultimate ally. Read Richard Hamming’s ‘ You and Your Research ’.\n\nHelp your mentor. Michael Faraday attended all of Humphrey Davy’s lectures and presented him with a bound book of lecture notes at the end of the course. This led to him getting a job, and changed his life. Writing a summary of the work of someone you admire and presenting it to them can work well.\n\nDon’t overfit or hero-worship once in a lab. Many scientists are not great. Don’t be surprised if some graduate students are disappointingly illogical or uninterested in original work. Find people with child-like wonder and enthusiasm, and a history of results.\n\nStay humble and focused\n\nThe most common way smart teenagers neuter their success is by becoming addicted to wunderkind fame. This phenomenon is at a fever pitch in the modern era of social networking. Being a TedXYouth speaker should not be your goal. Status is an infinite treadmill. You can spend your entire life trying to chase it and achieve little societal value.\n\nThe best people, teenagers or not, are somewhat embarrassed by anything successful that they do, and immediately refocus on the next goal out of a desire to not think about the achievements of the past. Be that person. Do something significant with your life. Significance doesn’t come from getting all sorts of badges on your LinkedIn profile. Significance comes from denting the universe in a positive way.\n\nAdults who know nothing of your field may tell you that you are great because of what you are doing at your age. Be nice but internally skeptical when they do.\n\nPublic recognition can be helpful, but treat it like a dangerous resource.\n\nThe hard stuff\n\nYou may feel depressed, anxious or lonely. Know that you are not alone. In almost all cases, things will get better, and you will make it through. My Dad used to tell me ‘it always gets darkest before dawn’. I didn’t understand what he meant when I was a kid, but now I do.\n\nFind friends. If you don’t have them, find a place (Silicon Valley for entrepreneurs, Cambridge or Caltech for those more scientifically minded) where you can find people who are driven like you. Being around optimistic, motivated, intelligent peers is like intellectual rocket fuel. Read about people you admire and relate to. Biographies are a great way to journey through life with the most interesting people in history.\n\nBuild a network of people you will work with for the rest of your life. Read about the X Club (Darwin and Huxley) and the PayPal Mafia. Optimism, ambition and genuine niceness are great attributes in these types of groups. A good way to seed one is to set up a recurring dinner club with 5-6 people, or a chat group.\n\nHave fun with your friends. Go to the beach together at midnight, light a bonfire and talk about ideas. Camp and hike together. Share life stories. Bake cookies and watch movies in your living room under a fort like the ones you constructed as a kid. Build robots together, do chemistry experiments at home. Living with a great group can be truly exceptional.\n\nDon’t rely on being young too much. This is a finite resource. Someone may be kind to you because you are at a particularly vulnerable stage of life, but relying on this will leave you psychologically crippled when you are an adult and realize you are not young anymore. It’s uncomfortable to consider, but know the various non-merit based reasons why someone might take a first meeting with you and don’t expect to rely on them as you become older.\n\nAction comes before motivation. Learn to get work done even if you don’t feel like it at first. Find which actions lead to the flywheel of effects (positive reinforcement from others, successful completion of tasks you enjoy) that will motivate you to pursue a certain path. Carefully design systems for yourself. You may feel extreme motivation after watching the Social Network movie, but in the 11th hour get bored and tired of chasing down some abstract programming bug - you must ensure that, if there is an important goal you’d like to achieve, the clear-eyed version of yourself sets up a system to ensure that a later, less motivated of yourself will get it done.\n\nSo, in closing, here’s the gist . If you’re a teenager trying to push ahead, it’s a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the world is against you: older people will shower you with confusing compliments, your body will go through some funky adjustments, and you’re not likely to get the tools and access you need to fully achieve your success.\n\nOn the other hand, you’re in the 21st century. The Internet is at your fingertips. You found this very post, for example. Let that be a reminder to you of what else is possible and how little effort it takes to combust success in your own life. Don’t worry too much. Plenty of time to have your existential crisis in your 50s. For now, focus on finding something practical to work on, mentors that will value you for your true work, books that will delight you and peers that will inspire you. There’s never been a better time to be an ambitious teenager.","tokenFrequency":{"caltech":1,"meet":1,"except":1,"els":1,"50s":1,"kind":1,"admir":2,"suggest":1,"resourc":2,"speak":1,"friend":2,"speaker":1,"phenomenon":1,"use":2,"immedi":1,"path":2,"anymor":1,"chemistri":2,"research":4,"becam":1,"danger":1,"peer":2,"good":5,"obvious":2,"huxley":1,"paypal":1,"reli":3,"best":3,"existenti":1,"effort":1,"interest":6,"care":1,"competit":1,"close":1,"childlik":1,"alway":1,"darwin":1,"much":3,"achiev":5,"student":4,"never":2,"respect":1,"defin":1,"attend":1,"origin":4,"combust":1,"in":1,"inspir":1,"fort":1,"biographi":1,"alon":2,"post":1,"subject":1,"let":1,"program":2,"nonmerit":1,"infinit":1,"quick":1,"note":3,"grill":1,"dinner":1,"bug":1,"expert":2,"scientif":1,"sleep":1,"flywheel":1,"psycholog":1,"scientist":3,"free":2,"dormitori":1,"silli":1,"fli":1,"outlier":1,"teacher":1,"rotat":1,"mani":5,"enjoy":2,"convinc":1,"understand":1,"express":1,"whi":1,"way":4,"access":1,"bodi":1,"glad":1,"ultim":1,"shower":1,"job":1,"reinforc":1,"light":2,"answer":2,"mafia":1,"biolog":1,"lone":1,"delight":1,"may":7,"signific":4,"rocket":1,"darkest":1,"you'd":1,"terranc":1,"lab":5,"led":1,"fun":1,"success":5,"plenti":1,"exist":1,"push":1,"genuin":2,"bake":1,"made":1,"write":3,"heroworship":1,"life":9,"group":4,"finit":1,"end":2,"neuter":1,"differ":1,"mix":1,"sound":1,"task":1,"there":2,"hard":1,"realiz":1,"crisi":1,"nice":2,"simpli":1,"meant":2,"relentless":1,"advanc":1,"addict":1,"mathemat":1,"anxious":1,"pitch":1,"place":1,"illog":1,"realli":1,"cambridg":2,"bonfir":1,"dent":1,"recognit":1,"underestim":1,"done":2,"everi":2,"impact":2,"didn't":1,"possibl":3,"ambit":1,"design":1,"explan":1,"histori":2,"valu":2,"stuff":1,"core":1,"book":2,"postdoc":1,"noth":1,"various":1,"wrote":1,"centuri":3,"club":2,"silicon":1,"mathematician":1,"mind":1,"robot":1,"cours":1,"pull":1,"test":1,"favor":1,"entrepreneur":1,"status":1,"thought":1,"think":2,"describ":1,"length":1,"ahead":1,"togeth":4,"21":1,"sort":1,"wonder":1,"import":2,"blue":1,"adult":3,"effect":1,"also":1,"drawn":1,"find":15,"least":1,"lot":1,"feel":3,"tri":4,"assum":1,"list":1,"here":1,"guess":1,"you'r":5,"onlin":1,"simpl":1,"expens":1,"vulner":1,"truli":2,"don't":9,"motiv":5,"money":1,"day":2,"spend":3,"scienc":1,"erdo":1,"summari":1,"hike":1,"surpris":1,"see":1,"knowledg":1,"worri":1,"richard":1,"real":2,"school":2,"bag":1,"tedxyouth":1,"complet":5,"want":2,"beach":1,"watch":2,"freeli":1,"modern":1,"pursu":1,"funki":1,"humphrey":1,"21st":1,"applic":1,"depress":1,"extrem":1,"mission":1,"concis":1,"famous":2,"attribut":1,"overfit":1,"56":1,"optim":1,"enthusiasm":1,"must":1,"davi":1,"goal":3,"graduat":3,"outcom":1,"tool":1,"embarrass":1,"18":1,"bit":1,"later":1,"page":1,"what":2,"disappoint":1,"nurtur":1,"era":1,"learn":7,"base":1,"crippl":1,"come":3,"driven":1,"ask":4,"persist":1,"share":2,"result":2,"pick":3,"profil":1,"consid":1,"chase":2,"lectur":2,"alli":1,"theme":1,"high":3,"system":2,"hand":2,"mayb":1,"past":1,"rote":1,"standard":2,"network":3,"skeptic":2,"everyth":1,"construct":1,"valley":1,"reason":1,"excel":1,"expect":1,"peopl":12,"it":3,"question":6,"recur":2,"societ":1,"11th":1,"present":2,"obsess":2,"first":2,"notebook":3,"probabl":1,"someon":4,"well":1,"though":1,"respond":1,"read":3,"confus":3,"make":4,"subsequ":1,"equip":1,"math":1,"even":2,"bore":1,"":46,"ham":1,"thing":4,"linkedin":1,"ever":1,"chat":1,"camp":1,"go":4,"trajectori":1,"volum":1,"cultiv":1,"entir":1,"annus":1,"work":13,"take":4,"apart":1,"seen":1,"person":4,"practic":1,"uninterest":1,"curios":1,"ensur":2,"clearey":1,"social":2,"case":1,"anyth":1,"week":1,"young":5,"live":2,"show":2,"treat":1,"optimist":1,"tao":1,"2123":1,"hour":3,"fall":1,"other":1,"less":1,"treadmil":1,"talk":3,"littl":2,"dad":1,"home":1,"excit":1,"bound":1,"suffic":1,"mirabili":1,"someth":4,"action":2,"plan":1,"doesn't":1,"world":1,"certain":1,"intellectu":2,"outstand":1,"intellig":1,"gist":1,"fuel":1,"problem":2,"uncomfort":1,"know":4,"age":2,"refocus":1,"unschool":1,"requir":2,"next":2,"remind":1,"might":3,"fulli":1,"particular":3,"year":2,"whatev":1,"regard":2,"progress":1,"almost":1,"20th":2,"set":2,"odd":1,"room":1,"grothendiek":2,"journey":1,"field":5,"idea":4,"kid":2,"version":1,"univers":2,"stage":1,"advic":1,"leav":2,"cooki":1,"colleg":5,"internet":1,"influenti":1,"say":1,"tire":1,"faraday":1,"encount":1,"14":1,"stick":1,"equival":1,"smart":1,"valuabl":1,"movi":2,"around":2,"experi":1,"win":1,"isaac":1,"chang":1,"heat":1,"relat":1,"seed":1,"build":2,"plane":1,"fingertip":1,"public":1,"michael":1,"desir":1,"for":1,"email":1,"lose":1,"concept":1,"perfect":1,"exampl":1,"wunderkind":1,"like":8,"humbl":1,"get":12,"time":9,"valid":1,"type":1,"accept":1,"fame":1,"within":1,"rest":1,"need":1,"40+":1,"adjust":1,"yet":1,"given":1,"poke":1,"ambiti":2,"buy":1,"tell":2,"midnight":1,"dawn":1,"everyon":2,"found":1,"better":2,"step":1,"project":4,"teenag":4,"intern":1,"focus":2,"discrimin":1,"newton":1,"great":6,"manag":1,"becom":2,"somewhat":1,"older":2,"badg":1,"mentor":4,"avail":1,"sky":1,"

Worldbuilding on the Digital Frontier - Reboot","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/darkforest?s=w","content":"I've read the book Ender's Game at least ten times in the last ten years. There are so many wonderful things about the series, but what I really latched on to—and predated the work I'm currently doing—was the part where Ender's siblings wrote articles on web forums with fake names. I was and am still obsessed with the idea that relatively powerless figures can leverage online information ecosystems to make shit happen on a geopolitical scale.\n\nI think a lot of technologists have something similar to my Ender's Game moment. They come across a creative work—a book, a video game, a movie—that shocks them into imagining the wild utopias and dystopias that technology makes possible.\n\nToday, I'm sharing an interview with my good friend gubsheep. He's a 2020 Thiel Fellow currently building the Dark Forest video game and other zero-knowledge cryptography experiments. Inspired by our last event with Cory Doctorow, I hit him up to chat about his sci-fi inspirations and the design challenges around Dark Forest. Gubsheep also helped create HackLodge , a program for student developers, and he spends his time thinking about crypto, communities, and digital worlds.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat was the first sci-fi book you read that really changed the way you approach your work?\n\nThe seeds of my interest in decentralized technology were planted about five years ago, when a friend gave me a copy of True Names: and the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier . It contains the novella True Names by Vernor Vinge and a collection of essays from cypherpunks and other thought leaders in early cryptography.\n\nVernor Vinge was one of the first authors to hypothesize about a digitally interconnected world many years before the early internet. True Names lays out a vision for pseudonymity and anonymity in cyberspace; for example, the idea that because of privacy-preserving cryptography, cyberspace may be much harder for traditional meatspace authorities to exert control over. Like other influential sci-fi books like Snow Crash and Ready Player One, the most powerful people in True Names are totally unassuming in the context of traditional power structures—but wield enormous power in a digital reality. Vinge inspired a lot of writers and technologists to start actually building towards this vision.\n\nSo tell me about what you're working on now!\n\nFor the last 18 months, I've been working on a project called Dark Forest . It's a massively multiplayer, real-time strategy game built on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses new cryptographic technology to make much richer and more dynamic online worlds than were previously possible.\n\nAround 2019, there was an explosion in a subtopic of crypto called zero-knowledge cryptography (ZK crypto), which allows you to perform verifiable computations without showing what data you're performing the computation on.\n\nRight now, there are two applications of ZK crypto that people care a lot about. One is privacy tech, like sending anonymous cash back and forth on the blockchain. The second is scalability tech: there are ways to use the mathematical techniques behind ZK crypto to make blockchains more efficient. But the third application that I'm most interested in—and that there's been very little activity on so far—is using ZK crypto to create games and digital worlds.\n\nCan you explain me how ZK crypto works in the Dark Forest game?\n\nAll games can be divided into two categories: complete information games and incomplete information games. Complete information games are games where everybody knows everything going on, like checkers or chess. Incomplete information games are games like poker or Starcraft where not everybody has full data on the world state. For example, I don't know what's in your hand in poker, and you don't know where my base is located in classical strategy games.\n\nThis distinction matters because incomplete information games often have a much richer and deeper strategy space and more interesting social dynamics to explore. If not every player knows the same thing, you enable emergent social dynamics like deception and conditional coordination.\n\nBut blockchains by design have open and transparent data layers. On the Bitcoin network, you can see a full record of all the transactions that have happened since the beginning of the system. So until ZK crypto was productized, the only games built on decentralized systems were very simple ones like CryptoKitties and other trading card games.\n\nIn 2019, we realized that we could use ZK crypto to make incomplete information games on the blockchain. Now, players can make moves while keeping their private information hidden; that is, a player doesn't need to know exactly where I am to verify that my move was valid.\n\nDark Forest revolves around a common strategy game mechanic and plot device called the \"fog of war.\" You start off at a home planet in a little corner of the universe. Until you have explored some area of the map, you don't know where or whether other civilizations exist. This anxiety—not knowing what's out there, and not knowing who's seen you—drives a lot of the dramatic action.\n\nHow did Liu Cixin's Three-Body trilogy, and specifically The Dark Forest, inspire the storyline for the game?\n\nThis answer is fascinating, but contains mild/vague spoilers for the Three-Body trilogy. We've footnoted it, so scroll to the bottom to read!\n\nDark Forest engages the central questions of politics, international relations, and human nature itself: for example, do you assume that everybody is power-hungry, or do you think empires can use diplomacy to create cooperative bodies like the UN? Since you don't have a formal background in these subjects, I'm curious how you derive your understanding of these issues.\n\nThat's a great question, and my answer is that I don't think we're capable of theorizing about it. We've built a very specific sandbox environment that may or may not bear resemblance to real-world situations. I think the best thing we can do as universe designers is to let people in, see what they do, and try to learn from that.\n\nWe've actually been quite surprised by a lot of player behavior. Coming in, we were anchored off Liu Cixin's Three-Body trilogy, where one of the implicit theses is that everyone is maximally suspicious and maximally cautious. Whereas in the Dark Forest game, a lot of players end up engaging in negotiations, trade, diplomacy, and even alliances.\n\nIt turns out that the communication channels available to players impacts their behavior. For example, we allow players to link their game accounts to their Twitter handles. One thing that organically emerged is that when players ran into each other, before taking any action, they would DM each other to determine if the other person was hostile, friendly, or might even be open to an alliance to wipe out another bigger player. We later moved the community to Discord and created channels where players can broadcast signals to each other.\n\nThe Dark Forest team tries to be fairly hands-off and non-prescriptive about how players should play. I don't think you can stop either players of a video game or players in the grand game of life from doing what they want. We’ve learned that people aren't going to bend to your theorizing.\n\nDo you think that building Dark Forest has made you more optimistic about human nature?\n\nThe crypto ecosystem is very polarizing. You truly get the best and the absolute worst of people. For example, Satoshi and Vitalik are so committed to a vision of open technologies, and they've given up so much in the process. But any system that has economic incentives built in will simultaneously attract the most amoral people: the scammers, the grifters, the pump-and-dump shills.\n\nWe've been trying to be deliberate about constructing a community that self-selects as the former. So far, there aren't any financial mechanisms built into the game, though in the future, there almost certainly will be. And I've been pleasantly surprised that the game attracts developers who want to write code and share it with others—a lot of our third-party developers spend hours a day helping newbies write scripts or understand the Dark Forest plugin system. So this project has actually made me very optimistic for the decentralized universe community.\n\nYou can find more of gubsheep on his Twitter or Dark Forest's Twitter and blog .\n\n🌏 Gubsheep also recommended this New Yorker profile of Liu Cixin , which gets into the sci-fi author's upbringing, modern Chinese politics, and his Machiavellian—or pragmatic—imagination. “I did not begin writing for love of literature,” he says. “I did so for love of science.”\n\n🕸️ Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin breaks down the three types of decentralization : architectural, political, and logical.\n\n🏰 In this podcast, MacArthur genius and fantasy author NK Jemisin teaches Ezra Klein to world-build . I was especially impressed by the way her historical knowledge informs the constraints of her worlds.\n\n💰 The following is provided for informational purposes only, and should not be relied on as legal, tax, or investment advice. (Or should it?)\n\nI've never been a gamer, so I turned to the Reboot Fellows to ask why they game:\n\nKhoi (mentor, Fanhouse founder): Whereas fiction feels like worldbuilding via relationships and imagination; games feel like worldbuilding via roleplay and mastery. Also, when I used to make games, I'd find people do completely unexpected things. It’s harder to interpret fiction in a novel way from the author's intent than to find delight in a game that was unintended by the game designers.\n\nLucas (fellow, Brown 2023): Not my quote, but I thought of Bushnell’s Law, coined by the founder of Atari (Nolan Bushnell): “All the best games are easy to learn and difficult to master. They should reward the first quarter and the hundredth.”\n\nFinally, if you could fill out Reboot's 1-minute feedback survey , that would be awesome. I personally read every single response!\n\nDisclaimer (Aug 2021): Reboot has since received a $5k grant from Dark Forest’s associated foundation.

agony of eros: on limerence - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/the-agony-of-eros-on-limerence?s=r","content":"Hello! This is the next installment in my series on how love hurts and why. Recently the main character of Twitter was a woman who left her husband of 14 years after meeting a guy she really vibed with at a conference. She became convinced over the course of an evening that he was her soulmate. The title of her forthcoming book is When A Soulmate says No, so it turns out that he was not her soulmate. But why did she think he might be? Limerence.\n\nThe psychologist Dorothy Tennov coined the term limerence, which is the obsessive, all-consuming feeling certain people get when they fall in love. She writes about it in depth in her book Love and Limerence . The most prominent characteristic of limerence, as she explains it, is 1) intense fixation on whether your feelings are reciprocated and 2) obsessive preoccupation with the love object. Like: you wake up thinking about them, you go through your day thinking about them, you lie in bed at night thinking about them. From a paper on treating limerence with a CBT approach:\n\nThe greater the degree of uncertainty, the more intensely the individual ruminates about the LO, and the greater the desire for reciprocation. This pattern of uncertainty about the LO's feelings and availability may distinguish limerence from the early stages of a typical romantic relationship, in which both partners often experience infatuation or obsession with each other.\n\nLimerence can make people act insane. In her book on romantic obsession, Unrequited , Lisa A. Phillips described an episode of limerence she experienced when she was 30, and how her deranged behavior during it inspired the book: “My unrequited love became obsessive. It changed me from a sane, conscientious college teacher and radio reporter into someone I barely knew—someone who couldn’t realize that she was taking her yearning much, much too far.” In Agnes Callard’s essay The Eros Monster she describes an affair she was enmeshed in that sounds like as a classic episode of limerence:\n\nIt was torture. I rapidly found myself thinking of little else. I fell behind on obligations, forgot appointments, lost weight and sleep; a few months in, I began drinking. About a year in, thoughts of suicide surfaced—was that the only way out? I sought professional help. Therapy, for better and worse, equipped me to deal with the roller coaster, to accept it as my new reality. When I would complain, Hugolof himself would tell me to “just walk away.”\n\nSometimes I thought, and said, that I loved him. At other times I hated him to the point that, if I didn’t hear from him for a day, the possibility of his death conjured the tantalizing prospect of relief. It might seem incredible that you can hate the person you claim to love, yet that is exactly what happens when eros becomes a trap.\n\nDuring the Hugolof years, my usually stable and mild emotions came to fluctuate wildly. I would conjure up tender charity and affection, having, just the moment before, whipped myself into bitter outrage. Superstitious thinking requires a massive investment of energy; the vacillation between hopefulness and despair is what fuels the perpetual thinker’s unending inquiry into what this or that new detail means. When everything out there is heavy with symbolism crying out for interpretation, one’s inner life becomes saturated with emotion.\n\nOf course, not all people who are limerent end up becoming stalkers. In Tennov’s book there are many examples of people who become intensely limerent for coworkers or even lovers but never express it out of fear of scaring the person away. Picture a grade school crush where you stare at the back of a boy’s head and doodle his name on ruled paper but never talk to him for years. Tennov: “Just as all roads once led to Rome, when your limerence for someone has crystallized, all events, associations, stimuli, experience return your thoughts to LO with unnerving consistency.”\n\nAlso, some people never become limerent, which means they perceive people who do become limerent as totally unrelatable. If you’re reading this essay like “what the fuck is she talking about,” maybe that’s you! Which is wild, if you think about it: some percentage of people are being hijacked by this very intense neurochemical experience either once or multiple times throughout their life, about which endless songs are written and movies are filmed, and other people have no clue what it’s all about.\n\nThe onset is difficult to predict and may happen in all sorts of circumstances. It can be sudden or gradual.\n\nWhen people feel ecstatic union (“Love is a human religion in which another person is believed in”)—that’s limerence.\n\nThere’s an inability to be limerent about more than one person at a time.\n\nLimerent episodes tend to last between 18 months and 3 years.\n\nSexual attraction is an essential component of limerence.\n\nLimerence is predicted on uncertainty; when you are sure of reciprocation, it naturally disappears over time.\n\nWishing you weren’t limerent does not help you become less limerent, lol.\n\nTennov identified three ways in which limerence disappears:\n\nConsummation : Your feelings are returned, and therefore you become less preoccupied over time.\n\nStarvation: It becomes clear over time that your feelings are definitely not returned (though you might spend a long time fantasizing that they are), and the limerence gradually fades.\n\nTransference : You find someone else to be obsessed with.\n\nPeople who are anxious tend to experience limerence more often than people who are not; it bears a lot of similarity to anxious-preoccupied attachment. This paper “exploring the lived-experience of limerence” suggest that the people we become limerent from are influenced by our parental figures:\n\nThe idea of a construction of a LO type that emerged from a variety of early caregiver memories, might also explain why a LO often fails to reciprocate or fulfil the desired emotional connection (or at best sends mixed messages of reciprocation). Specifically, LO selection in Limerence appears to involve some yet-unformulated mix of early caregiver triggers and unmet emotional needs which parallel, yet supersede, the normative more successful factors of mate selection, examples being physical attractiveness and compatibility of values and interests (Berry, 2000; Rubin, 1973). Indeed, one respondent specifically linked the idea of childhood attachment figures, separation anxiety, trauma and self-identity and in this sense Limerence may involve creating imaginary companions (Taylor, 1999; Taylor, Carlson, Maring, Gerow, \u0026 Chaley, 2004) and/or later maladaptive fantasy with extensive structured immersive imagination and disassociated states (Bigelsen \u0026 Schupac, 2011; Dell \u0026 O’Neil, 2009) as a form of coping, whereby imagined emotional reciprocation and proximity reduces anxiety and facilitates temporary relief.\n\nInformants who described what I came to call “affectional bonding” usually replied affirmatively to my initial question about whether they felt themselves to be in love. But unlike those whose relationship was based on limerence, they did not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feel intense need for exclusivity, describe their goals in terms of reciprocity, or speak of ecstasy. Instead, they emphasized compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, pleasurable sexual experiences, and, in some cases, a degree of relative contentment that was rare (even impossible) among persons experiencing limerence.\n\nIt generally seems that it’s impossible to maintain limerence in a healthy long-term relationship (it’s a mechanism to induce pair bonding), so when people who have been together for 20 years say they’re “in love” they’re referring to affectional bonding, not limerence. Maslow described it as D-love versus B-love:\n\nMaslow wrote of “D-love,” which he said was not love at all but a state of dependency. “B-love,” in contrast, should be welcomed into consciousness; it is never a problem but can be enjoyed endlessly. It has beneficial effects on the persons involved since it is associated with individual autonomy and independence. B-lovers are not unreasonably jealous and they are not blind. It is the other, damaging D-love which blinds you. In true love (B-love) you are able to perceive your lover clearly and penetratingly.\n\nLimerence is the feeling of being possessed by desire. When you ask people about being limerent it’s not atypical to hear “It almost ruined my life,” sometimes followed by “I miss the intensity of it.” If you want to freak yourself out, check out the Limerence subreddit, where you can see posts like “Honestly if I could punish someone, I would make them limerent for the rest of their life. It’s the most slowest and painful way to die.” From the paper :\n\nTheme 3: Disintegration of the self. The respondents regarded Limerence as a disintegration of the self in that a state of turmoil develops which manifests as uncontrolled, turbulent emotions. These included feelings of confusion, destabilisation and being out of control, even to the point of stalking a LO. All of the respondents recognised Limerence as an emotional rollercoaster, which the following respondents describe below.\n\n[Limerence as...] Elation and despair (R5). Rushes of fondness and excitement and false hope (R4).\n\nEuphoric feelings of love, combined with guilt, self-condemnation and confusion (R3).\n\nLimerence inspires a lot of art. Books that are about limerence: Simple Passion by Annie Ernaux, I Love Dick by Chris Kraus, What We Do in the Dark by Michelle Hart, 22 Minutes of Unconditional Love by Daphne Merkin, The Ravishing of Lol V Stein by Marguerite Duras (honestly all of Duras, if you ask me), Anais Nin’s diaries, Madame Bovary, Anna Karenina. “Ruin me, but do not leave me,” wrote Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich to the courtesan La Bella Otero: that’s limerence. Henry to Anais: Anaïs, I am going to open your very groins. God forgive me if this letter is ever opened by mistake. I can’t help it. I want you. I love you. You’re food and drink to me—the whole bloody machinery, as it were. Lying on top of you is one thing, but getting close to you is another. I feel close to you, one with you, you’re mine whether it is acknowledged or not. Limerence!\n\nI never knew how to think about it: as a real emotion, or as an involuntary chemical reaction. I guess it’s both. For many people limerence will be the strongest emotion they ever experience, the feeling with the most amplitude. In Unrequited, Phillips describes her friend Katherine, who finds herself in constant unrequited crushes which seem to lead to nothing but frustration: Heather Havrilesky described it as a “ prayer to a closed door .” When Philips describes Katherine to another friend of hers, the friend “countered, “That’s the kind of fantasy that my therapist would say was completely unrealistic and neurotic, and there’s nothing good about it.” Phillips goes on: “This view is understandable and common. But it ignores the value of the emotional honesty of allowing yourself to feel love, even when it can’t be returned.”\n\nOn a podcast discussing her essay , Agnes Callard talks about how Plato believed that obsessive love for another person could sometimes be successfully be converted into a non-possessive love of the beauty you see in them, which you can then appreciate in all other places it appears in the world. I love that idea—the thought that a self-centered obsession, an intense experience of projecting desire onto another person, can become an appreciation of the good within them. We are all, in our own time, capable of turning our internal preoccupation outward.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Then Think - LessWrong","link":"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPFuxpGEevyGgMwJ2/do-then-think","content":"48\n\nRational Thought Is Best Past a Certain Data Threshold\n\nWe Often Think About Stuff That’s Already Decided\n\nWe Can’t Control Thought Through Anything But Action\n\nThis is a linkpost for https://www.epistem.ink/p/do-then-think?utm_source=url\n\nIf there’s one lesson that I learned from almost every single smart person I know, it’s:\n\nThe unreasonable effectiveness of doing, then thinking; vs thinking too much before doing\n\nThis is not something I’ve been able to convince anyone of, at least not with a rational argument. I might tell people things like:\n\nStop ruminating about changing jobs, make accounts at x/y/z today, and fill them in minimally... yes, like, in 20 minutes, yes, it’s fine if they are not perfect. Then apply to 100 jobs, no, no, don’t spend 1 hour ruminating over each one, just write a 5-minute intention letter, you’ll have like a 5% reply rate anyway, just focus on the ones that send interview... I don’t mean like that, don’t ruminate for hours about every interview!\n\nYeah, it’s a super complex piece of kit you need to build. But like, you’ve given me a use-case, you explained one of its components, just write a test and see where it goes. Yeah, I understand the test will fail, I understand it won’t even compile, whatever, just write it. Or if you don’t want to do that write the component you described to me, it can be broken, doesn’t matter. Or heck, find a similar~ish project and just copy-paste it and start cutting and remaking. Doesn’t matter that you’re starting from a Reddit clone and you want to build genetics testing CRM, it can still serve as a starting-off point.\n\nYeap, getting into a new field is hard, but whatever, fake it til you make it. Buy the right books, follow the right people on Twitter, read the right blogs, build something that seems like it suits that field. Yes, the books will be wrong, you’ll be following dumb people that every insider actually derides, the blogs will be off-topic, you’ll build something shamefully bad. Doesn’t matter, just do it.\n\nAnd I can’t for the life of me convince people about doing these things because they seem “rash”... and I keep thinking (therefore I know I exist): “what the fuck are they thinking” (therefore I know they exist as a separate entity), “why is this rash, you’re not trying to spear-hunt a fucking bear, you're writing some code in the privacy of your own home, the place you masturbate in, surely the shame of failing miserably can’t be that bad”.\n\nAnyway, I’m not going to try to convince anyone to do then think. I can’t prove nor even properly conceptualize why you should start doing that. But I want to try and at least think about a few reasons why doing before thinking, or at least doing something that seems like doing before thinking, is so unreasonably ineffective.\n\nYou all know the drill here.\n\nBrilliant scientist thinks a lot about a problem, gathers all the data that doesn’t make sense and all the data that already makes sense and needs to keep making sense, struggles for a few days and comes up with nothing... then, he wakes up from a dream drooling inspiration, runs to his notebook in a trance and figures out relativity/microscopy/the periodic table/DNA structure.\n\nIf we assume that, at any given time, a large part of brain networks are inactive or below the state of conscious control, then it’s only a short inference away that the patterns of thought that’d bring them online are best triggered by actually doing the tasks and letting said networks “figure out” that they need to to help and how.\n\nExamples of this that everyone’s noticed are learning to ride a bike, row, climb, surf, etc. Complex motor skills are learned with minimal conscious input, the conscious mind just decided to get on the bike as best it can, it receives instructions like “push with your leg in a sort of rotation motion”... and 1 hour later the network that can actually handle bike riding has learned how to do it. It’s important to note that riding a bike can’t be first learned at a theoretical level.\n\nAnyway, we’re talking about things that are more complex than bike riding here, so I get that the analogy doesn’t fit perfectly, but remember that bit about theory not being useful for beginners? I assume it’s not the same for professionals.\n\nProfessional bikers might spend hours a day discussing cycling theory, optimizing things besides bike riding like their doping regiment, training adjacent skills that they think are particularly important but hard to train “while doing the thing”. Professional sportspeople in general presumably do this quite a lot, though I expect it’s much more common at complex sports (think football, skiing) than at simple ones (sprinting, javelin throwing).\n\nThis might in part work because rational thought is good at polishing up ideas and behaviors but can’t start from a position of insufficient data, or rather, is really dumb from a position of insufficient data.\n\nLet's think of a complex skill that people are really anxious about practicing, let’s say picking up people or interviewing with an important manager. How’s intuitively going to be better, someone that read a dozen interviewing-and-business/pickup-artistry books and watched videos and prepared bits to say... or someone that’s already done it 4 or 5 times (even if they failed)? Almost certainly the latter.\n\nTheory and rationality seem to only help from a position where data is plentiful to think with, where there are real-world examples to think about, where you’ve already “felt” a system from the inside. Sure enough, people seem to have come up with a promising theory about mechanics much sooner than about waves, and for seemingly no fault of experimental devices, it’s just that we “do mechanics” in our day-to-day lives.\n\nLet’s say thinking involves several disadvantages, it wastes time, it stresses you out, it makes you less likely to do anything in the long term (because doing anything is stressful and time-consuming), and so on.\n\nThis would still make thinking advantageous if you have to go spear that bear since you want that kind of scenario to be a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so the extra stress and time is not only worthwhile for a slightly lower chance of death, it’s the appropriate signal to send: “This is really hard and dangerous, don’t do this ever again”.\n\nAlas, we are usually in lack of life and death scenarios, and furthermore, we are trained to think too much in easy situations that should require no thought (e.g. solving math problems at school) in order to get a slight edge over someone else (e.g. during an exam).\n\nSo it might be that doing than thinking is unreasonably effective because we trade-off on wasting time and producing anxiety that might make us never take useful action, to begin with.\n\nAn important bit there is to remember that the network/self/you which thought the action is good is often not the network doing it. Maybe you did ponder the idea of getting a new job for a lot, decided on yes, and now the pesky you actually doing the job searching is thinking through every single job as though I’d be a life-and-death decision whether or not to apply. This leads me to...\n\nSure, it’s good to question the fundamentals of math every now and then, but maybe it’s not best to do it as part of solving a mildly annoying but certainly-doable calculation. It’s also worth thinking if you’ve gone a bit too extreme with your dieting, but doing so in the middle of a diet is bound to always result in you rationalizing “yes” to be the answer in order to splurge on sweets.\n\nThinking often leads us to quickly rethink at the “meta” level where a decision was already made, potentially a very thoughtful and thorough decision we made a while ago.\n\nAn important note here is that this should bias us against both thinking too much while doing something that’s been decided upon and towards planning fewer things at the “meta” level, leaving the doing for some other-self.\n\nEven though we have a lot of “mental power” available at any given moment, most of what we do with it feels “unelected”, we lack understanding about why conscious thoughts flow the way they do.\n\nBut a pretty reliable way to control thought is to put yourself into a situation where thought must take a certain pattern.\n\nIf you jump through a small hole in the roof of a bear’s den, wooden spear in hand, barely not awaking the fiend from hibernation, you’ll probably have more optimal thoughts about bear-killing than if you tried to “imagine” the scene. But the trade-off is risk. Similarly, with social situations, risks of saying the wrong thing or grooming the wrong monkey could have been rather high. So we grew to love “imagining” and be afraid of action.\n\nWhat we think of when not acting will be a function of what seems “most important”, thus many people end up ruminating about things such as politics, socializing and phobias. What we think of when acting will be the process itself, thus shortcutting the prioritization process.\n\nNone of this is a conclusive answer to the question, much less so a proof, but these are some of the intuitions I have about it.\n\nAs an aside, I conceptualize all of these intuitions while writing, maybe there were already formed in my subconscious, maybe they were created as a result of the imagined constraint of having to write this article, maybe they are all bad because I didn’t spend more than 30 minutes consciously ruminating on the subject, or maybe they are as good as the answers of someone that meditated upon the question his entire life... If only I could know for sure.","tokenFrequency":{"certain":3,"use":2,"“whi":1,"alreadi":6,"yeap":1,"bearkil":1,"articl":1,"input":1,"blog":2,"prove":1,"say":4,"act":2,"better":1,"calcul":1,"smart":1,"rotat":1,"lesson":1,"instruct":1,"seem":7,"tabledna":1,"control":3,"good":4,"don't":5,"“unelected”":1,"leav":1,"prepar":1,"extra":1,"particular":1,"decis":3,"presum":1,"could":2,"fewer":1,"sort":1,"go":3,"way":2,"help":2,"easi":1,"usual":1,"solv":2,"out”":1,"realworld":1,"that":3,"quick":1,"pretti":1,"“mental":1,"sooner":1,"5minut":1,"ski":1,"almost":2,"i'v":1,"signal":1,"ineffect":1,"peski":1,"know":5,"search":1,"edg":1,"sure":4,"action":4,"rememb":2,"chang":1,"day":2,"intuit":3,"build":4,"separ":1,"yes":4,"pick":1,"bit":4,"mechan":1,"privaci":1,"ponder":1,"school":1,"yeah":2,"begin":1,"still":2,"past":1,"anxious":1,"potenti":1,"profession":3,"mechanics”":1,"struggl":1,"sens":3,"mayb":6,"“rash”":1,"cut":1,"imagin":1,"live":1,"crm":1,"result":2,"cycl":1,"ride":5,"you'v":3,"spend":3,"stop":1,"someth":5,"bad":2,"involv":1,"common":1,"probabl":1,"certainlydo":1,"hibern":1,"leg":1,"wast":2,"work":1,"said":1,"situat":3,"anyon":2,"vs":1,"talk":1,"etc":1,"drill":1,"notebook":1,"general":1,"fundament":1,"throw":1,"tranc":1,"gather":1,"groom":1,"assum":2,"perfect":2,"remak":1,"i'm":1,"piec":1,"bias":1,"larg":1,"there":1,"diet":2,"send":2,"miser":1,"mild":1,"everyon":1,"period":1,"later":1,"jump":1,"adjac":1,"come":2,"effect":2,"row":1,"whatev":2,"let":4,"run":1,"import":5,"order":2,"sportspeopl":1,"test":3,"plenti":1,"advantag":1,"asid":1,"put":1,"tradeoff":2,"thing”":1,"upon":2,"thorough":1,"annoy":1,"job":5,"discuss":1,"daytoday":1,"sport":1,"can't":6,"task":1,"footbal":1,"produc":1,"less":2,"describ":1,"insuffici":2,"dope":1,"fit":1,"regiment":1,"monkey":1,"won't":1,"manag":1,"inact":1,"clone":1,"behavior":1,"compon":2,"anxieti":1,"again”":1,"sever":1,"dumb":2,"process":2,"network":4,"feel":1,"would":1,"rethink":1,"simpl":1,"fault":1,"least":3,"wake":1,"heck":1,"high":1,"often":3,"'s":1,"derid":1,"you'll":4,"explain":1,"see":1,"trigger":1,"subconsci":1,"brain":1,"hole":1,"letter":1,"one":5,"want":4,"power”":1,"priorit":1,"requir":1,"bare":1,"notic":1,"first":1,"reliabl":1,"minim":2,"“while":1,"state":1,"“figur":1,"onceinalifetim":1,"right":3,"entiti":1,"how":1,"get":5,"til":1,"fake":1,"field":2,"“push":1,"devic":1,"best":4,"new":2,"flow":1,"none":1,"pattern":2,"function":1,"ration":5,"everi":5,"take":2,"broken":1,"otherself":1,"think":24,"term":1,"unreason":3,"polit":1,"math":2,"risk":2,"doesn't":5,"lack":2,"fiend":1,"wrong":3,"like":10,"anyway":3,"motion”":1,"tri":4,"den":1,"compil":1,"answer":3,"given":3,"biker":1,"promis":1,"constraint":1,"fuck":2,"twitter":1,"short":1,"thought":11,"copypast":1,"level":3,"intent":1,"conclus":1,"grew":1,"realli":3,"similar":1,"understand":3,"kit":1,"hand":1,"goe":1,"spear":2,"bike":6,"networkselfyou":1,"“what":1,"bring":1,"onlin":1,"reddit":1,"thinking”":1,"skill":3,"hour":4,"bear":3,"eg":2,"read":2,"singl":2,"entir":1,"wooden":1,"optim":2,"matter":3,"similarish":1,"form":1,"decid":4,"thus":2,"much":6,"data":6,"system":1,"place":1,"ever":1,"drool":1,"httpswwwepisteminkpdothenthinkutmsource=url":1,"sinc":1,"need":3,"problem":2,"part":3,"creat":1,"infer":1,"write":7,"follow":2,"buy":1,"might":5,"brilliant":1,"javelin":1,"super":1,"danger":1,"lower":1,"rash":1,"disadvantag":1,"handl":1,"code":1,"end":1,"extrem":1,"it":12,"fill":1,"death":2,"that'd":1,"today":1,"tell":1,"masturb":1,"conscious":5,"receiv":1,"away":1,"proof":1,"shame":2,"roof":1,"practic":1,"point":1,"life":3,"chanc":1,"question":3,"“felt”":1,"“this":1,"repli":1,"reason":1,"someon":4,"made":2,"relativitymicroscopyth":1,"slight":2,"startingoff":1,"hard":3,"enough":1,"us":3,"stuff":1,"beginn":1,"shortcut":1,"theori":4,"genet":1,"alway":1,"fine":1,"argument":1,"“most":1,"surf":1,"make":8,"time":5,"account":1,"ala":1,"ago":1,"lead":2,"though":3,"figur":1,"didn't":1,"experiment":1,"mani":1,"kind":1,"note":2,"actual":4,"exampl":2,"sprint":1,"48":1,"therefor":2,"convinc":3,"rumin":5,"person":1,"20":1,"fail":3,"":35,"complex":5,"long":1,"linkpost":1,"dream":1,"middl":1,"quit":1,"start":4,"worth":1,"lot":4,"worthwhil":1,"scenario":2,"must":1,"small":1,"important”":1,"structur":1,"insid":2,"bad”":1,"home":1,"social":2,"exist":2,"“imagining”":1,"appropri":1,"appli":2,"even":4,"idea":2,"abl":1,"plan":1,"project":1,"analog":1,"bound":1,"video":1,"theoret":1,"wave":1,"inspir":1,"“yes”":1,"done":1,"exam":1,"splurg":1,"love":1,"we'r":1,"interviewingandbusinesspickupartistri":1,"also":1,"motor":1,"30":1,"gone":1,"els":1,"conceptu":2,"sweet":1,"awak":1,"peopl":8,"moment":1,"posit":3,"scene":1,"threshold":1,"xyz":1,"train":3,"usecas":1,"“meta”":2,"subject":1,"anyth":3,"avail":1,"focus":1,"“imagine”":1,"rather":2,"noth":1,"stress":3,"spearhunt":1,"scientist":1,"toward":1,"learn":5,"thing":8,"offtop":1,"medit":1,"100":1,"furthermor":1,"climb":1,"suit":1,"mean":1,"watch":1,"minut":2,"dozen":1,"latter":1,"whether":1,"serv":1,"expect":1,"“do":1,"keep":2,"lifeanddeath"

Letter #47: Till death do us part","link":"https://lettersfromhomeandaway.substack.com/p/-letter-47-till-death-do-us-part?s=r","content":"📩 Letter #47: Till death do us part The beauty of love, commitment, and a fast decision.\n\nI’m engaged. Three months after our first date, he bent down on one knee with a small box. We were alone, on a quiet beach. He held out a ring: his grandmother’s diamond reset in a thin gold band. I said yes. It wasn’t impulsive, it was planned. It felt serious and joyful, somber and celebratory, nerve-wracking and full of certainty, all at the same time.\n\nSome will be shocked. Three months? Are they nuts? Maybe. But it’s a beautiful thing to choose and to be chosen. It’s something our culture feels so disconnected from—the deep joy of making permanent decisions.\n\nI’m not naive. I understand the statistics: “50 percent of marriages end in divorce.” Research has shown 20 percent of married men and 10 percent of married women cheat on their spouses . Today, marriage is declining . An increasing number of adults are staying single or choosing to cohabitate with their partners instead. The paperwork, the legality of marriage, feels like a financial agreement doomed for emotional and economic pain. It’s burdensome and constricting. “Aren’t we all too modern for this?” critics say. But trends mean nothing until you examine the specifics. So here are the specifics. We met at church. Our first dates were not dates at all, but long walks to debate and argue. We took loops around Lake Austin to yammer about big topics: religion, philosophy, diet, exercise, money, family. What makes a meaningful life? Is there ever such thing as a good person? What does “good” mean? (Our mutual friends find us exhausting.) These days, we do the same thing over coffee and scrambled eggs in our kitchen. We talk to each other constantly—while cooking, showering, walking, reading, working. We’re like little parrots. Meanwhile, our text thread is so short I can still scroll to the top of it. Most of it says, “I’m here,” or “I’m parking,” or “Where are you?” The reason we talk so much is that we have so much to talk about. We are very different people. He runs marathons, I like to take naps. He dropped out of college to start a company, bored by the inanity of learning without doing. I long for learning, the quiet sound of a lecture hall filled with scratching pencils. I’m cautious and controlled, he’s decisive and instinctive. He is the most punctual person I’ve ever met. I try my best to be on time. He jumps out of bed at 6:00 am. I fiddle with my phone until 7:30 am, or 8:00 am, and roll over until 9:00 am. But we share core beliefs: There’s no such thing as a budget for books. Grey Poupon is better than Heinz. Faith comes first. Love the people around you. We believe in the value of inquisitiveness, asking “Why?” and “How?”\n\nHere’s something important: He’s not a perfect person. We squabble sometimes about crumbs left on the counter or different visions for vacation plans. (I hate spending money, he likes to celebrate.) But I’m not a perfect person either. I can be crabby, anxious, and neurotic. That’s what’s beautiful about the unending commitment of marriage. The flaws come too. We have space for messiness as well as joy. Within a lifelong commitment, I can free him from the burden of being perfect. Without the expectation of being the “perfect man,” he can be exactly what he is: A great man. (Crumbs and all.) That’s freeing.\n\nI’ve never known a relationship where I didn’t have to edit myself or put on a show. “The pretty girl with a smile and a positive attitude,” cast of one. But marriage is different. It’s not a theater performance you can dance and sing then drop when the curtain closes—it’s constant. It’s all day, every day. No one can be pretty, polite, skinny, and peppy for forever. Failure is a certainty. Yet he’s made a commitment to embrace me anyway, even when I’m messy, cranky, hungry, stinky, irrational, or too frugal. That’s not to say those characteristics are likable—they’re not—it’s to say that even when he doesn’t like it (or when I don’t like something he’s doing) we have a mutual agreement to keep going. To keep talking. To keep going on walks. To work through it.\n\nWithin the safety of that commitment, we can aim toward something nobler than perfection. We can aim toward becoming whole.\n\nThat’s an important distinction: unconditional love comes because of the commitment, not the other way around. So much of our culture—with shows like “The Bachelor” or “Love Island”—teaches us that the search for love is more important than the hard work of life in a relationship. We should hunt high and low for the perfect partner while casting aside anyone with blemishes. If they make a mistake, they’re gone. But once we find someone who is perfect, then we can fall in love. We’re looking for “the one.” Dating apps reinforce the idea: There are always more faces to swipe through. Your perfect match is out there, you just need to keep looking. That’s why in most rom coms, the wedding happens at the end of the movie. The hard work—the search—is over. The main character has finally found the object of their affection, and they ride into the sunset together. Roll credits. But for me, I’m choosing to believe the commitment is the beginning. It’s where the story starts. We’ve barely scribbled out our prologue. Where will the story go from here? I can’t wait to find out. XOXO,\n\nMy Book Rec: Euphoria , by Lily King Why I’m recommending it: OK, first, this book has nothing to do with the weird HBO show I hear people enjoy. This is about anthropologists in the 1930s exploring Papa New Guinea. It’s honestly a masterpiece. I read all of Lily King’s books the same way I eat watermelon: in giant gulping bites. It’s so sweet, tangy, and yet relaxing. I know I’m in the hands of someone who will take me on an adventure and deliver me safely home.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

It's too early to say much about this effort–like any startup, it feels exhilarating and terrifying at the same time, all the time. But I'd like to talk about how I got here and what experiences drove me to the decision to work in mass-oriented cooperatives.\n\nThe lesson I hope to drive home is this: If you are a technologist or otherwise a person possessing skill and talent (which you almost certainly are), and if you have the means to do so while sustaining yourself (which if you worked in tech for long you likely are), and if you have come to understand that the problems facing our planet are primarily political, not technological, then what you need to do is find a group of people who are struggling collectively to shift power from entrenched tyrannies towards the masses, and then you need to use your skill and talent to make that group successful.\n\nThe Stanford d.school was founded in 2004, the same year I arrived at Stanford. The d.school teaches design thinking, which I understand to be a systematic approach to understanding the needs of a population of users and then iteratively designing solutions to those needs, usually in the form of a product.\n\nThe buzz about design thinking hit its peak, at least in my life, in the early 2010s when I joined Facebook. The company had made a series of high-dollar acquisitions of design-centric firms and the story was that design was coming to save Facebook from the sprawling mess it had become. Coming from my experience at Stanford where I was enamored with design, I joined a team focused on design . Over time, my understanding of the role of design in corporations shifted.\n\nI have come to see design thinking as an anti-democratic system that is fantastic at delivering \"win-wins\" of a certain flavor but is ultimately a dead end for building emancipatory technology. The win-win is a Silicon Valley sacrament; an endeavor is worthwhile if and only if it provides positive value for all its participants. Never mind if one participant is a low-wage worker and another is a planet-scale corporation with an army of highly-trained designers, psychologists, lawyers, and lobbyists. Before the win-win, all are equal. And never mind if one side's win grows without bound while the other's shrinks to epsilon, the win-win cares only that the sign is positive.\n\nMy final project at Facebook was working on the Diem cryptocurrency and Novi consumer finance product. The company assembled an unmatched team of engineers, economists, researchers, and designers for this project. They had a lofty goal of bringing blockchain finance to the masses, with a focus on the international remittances market wherein workers leave their home countries to earn wages abroad which they remit home to their families. The fees on such transfers are often so high as to be criminal–some money transmitters make obscene profits exploiting the already most-exploited. One hope of Diem is that the price of moving money could be shrunk to nearly zero.\n\nI was already skeptical of Facebook's ability to do good in the world after seeing up close the ways they created clever legal workarounds to employment law to exploit the thousands of service workers on campus. If the company cannot take care of its own staff, if it creates arcane legal fictions to obscure the employment relation with its own service workers, content moderators, and QA testers, why should anyone believe the corporation will do right by its users, to whom the company's obligations end at a EULA and an ever-shifting privacy policy?\n\nBut I do actually believe that beneath the layers of speculation and charlatanism, blockchain technology has immense emancipatory potential. It enables mass participation in consensus-building in environments of low or moderate trust. But most any technology has emancipatory potential–the steam engine, the nuclear reactor, and the transistor could have been used for our collective liberation instead of the construction of imperialist war machines. We have lost repeatedly on the political terrain, not in the development of new technologies. In this domain workers have excelled beyond all imagination.\n\nWhat I noticed at Novi was that the belief in the power of design thinking led to workers at the company being completely comfortable making decisions for a group of users after conducting a research process upon them. Obviously rituals and practices around money and its movement vary around the world, and only by researching such practices in their specificity can they be understood and affected. But absent in this method is any actual empowerment of the users being researched. The promise of design thinking is that any sufficiently motivated and resourced designer can create products that intervene in the lives of the product's subjects to positive benefit. Modulated through the absolute requirement of the win-win, design thinking can improve others' lives so long as the result is also good for the designer's employer's shareholders. What if the interests of the users and the shareholders are at odds? Well, this must be handled artfully–not by directly harming the interests of the user, but, whenever possible, by helping the right kind of user in the right kind of way such that the win-win is preserved.\n\nFor me, the divide in the rhetoric of the Diem project and my growing understanding of US imperialism became too much. Does Venezuela really need a stablecoin to right its economy, or does it need to rise up against centuries of colonial extraction? Why do we ask how foreign workers can send money home instead of asking why does the global labor market routinely dislocate certain kinds of workers? I was burned out by my job, by attempting to organize within tech, and by organizing with DSA all at the same time. I wasn't being effective at any of them so I left Facebook to work on the Bernie 2020 campaign in DC for six weeks until lockdown and the end of the primaries sent me home.\n\nIn Silicon Valley circles it is taken as a given that the story of history is a story of technological progress. The telegraph changed everything and then the transistor changed everything and then the iPhone changed everything, again.\n\nBut technology is much more inert than that. All we can really say is that particular technologies were used in particular ways by particular actors in particular positions. It is actually social relations, mediated through technology , that move history. By understanding that social relations and technological development proceed together in a dialectical fashion, we can imagine different futures where technology is constructed and applied differently.\n\nWithout this social relations-centric understanding of technology it's easy to make mistakes and misapply ourselves. Frequently I see technologists flock to a problem affecting our society hoping to build a technical solution to it, and nearly as frequently I am certain that the solution to whatever problem is primarily going to involve changes in our social relations rather than incrementally more technological innovation.\n\nI believe this is the case when it comes to the common belief that a techno-fix is coming to save us from climate change. Many technologists I talk to believe that the best thing they could do to help avert climate collapse is to contribute their skills towards attempts to find the techno-fix. While, say, renewable energy sources and geo-engineering solutions may be necessary conditions for avoiding collapse, they are certainly not sufficient. Looking at the causes of climate degradation at a slightly deeper level, it might make more sense to conclude that the very small number of powerful entities that control all carbon production have already decided to extract and sell every drop of accessible carbon to be found on earth. The technologies needed to reverse this course have more to do with empowering masses of people to forcibly resist extraction than with providing energy monopolists with green alternatives that they are not interested in.\n\nWe can say the same about the crisis of misinformation on the internet. Many technologists I've worked with see the problems around misinformation as primarily issues to be addressed by machine learning, or, god help us, blockchain . But it's easy to see that scaled misinformation is just the shadow of the growth tactics employed by digital communication monopolists. Rather than attempting to fix the problem with the same level of thinking that caused it, we should change the ownership and regulation structures that incentivize growth-at-all-costs shareholder-maximization corporate structures.\n\nGenerally, if you see a problem and you think \"An app could solve this,\" I am skeptical.\n\nThere are currents within the workers' movement that are, in my analysis, excessively distrustful of institutions seeking power. In the world of class-conscious technologists, this can often look like a preference for the small over the large, or for decentralized structures over centralized. It can also be a preference for older, easy-to-manage technologies over technologies designed for massive scale. It can be a reticence to get entangled with capital or hire staff or transact with money. But technologists adhering to these tendencies still advocate for the development and use of technology, specifically software, towards emancipatory ends. I think of this set of beliefs as folk technologism.\n\nFolk technologism is an analogue of what Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams identified as folk politics in their book Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work. From the Wikipedia synopsis :\n\nThe book begins (chapters 1–2) by critiquing dominant left-wing thinking in the West, suggesting that since the cultural upheavals of the 1960s it has been characterised by a \"folk politics\" which aims to bring politics down to the \"human scale\". By emphasising temporal, spatial, and conceptual immediacy, folk politics tends to privilege reacting to change (through protest and resistance) over imagining new long-term goals; the immediate and tangible over the abstract; personal involvement in direct action over institutional responses; single issues over complex strategies; horizontal organising over hierarchical; and the local over the large-scale. While arguing that these approaches are important and can at times be effective, Srnicek and Williams argue that they are insufficient to tackle global capitalism and specifically neoliberalism.\n\nTo paraphrase a friend to whom I related this complaint, \"The world is burning. We do not have time for this.\" The institutions in power have steered technological development into collapse. They cannot be confronted in the small. They must be challenged at the largest scales, seized, and toppled. This means the state, logistics networks, fucking Google, all of it. We need to be thinking on industrial scales and creating projects and codebases that disrupt and replace the capitalist entities that hold power today. While we must bring immediacy to our work, affecting real workers with real needs, we must build with an eye towards scale. And we must not dampen our own prospects by pretending we can build anything at scale without access to capital and the compromises that capital will entail.\n\nSolving a problem for a small group of people is always the first step. Small-scale solutions that exist outside the standard system of capital accumulation are an existence proof that alternatives are possible. But an act is not revolutionary unless it contains within itself a path to achieving revolutionary scale.\n\nHaving rejected design thinking, technological determinism, and folk technologism, what strategies can a technologist embrace towards the success of our project? My thoughts here are early, but I am coming to think of the correct strategy as being chiefly agile and embedded.\n\nIn software construction, agile refers to a set of values and principles about how projects should be pursued and how teams should operate. In agile development, software creators continuously deliver value to clients on a frequent, regular schedule. There is no one initial \"planning session\" where the five year plan is laid out and then followed to a tee. Any creative person with a few years experience understands that any real project that attempts to plan everything in advance is guaranteed to fail. Instead, agile developers ship little bits of value every day and get immediate feedback from their customers. Instead of getting everything right, they try to get a little better each cycle. It should be obvious that practices that lead to a faster feedback loop between experimentation and observation will outcompete those that do not. \"Discover the truth through practice, and again through practice verify and develop the truth.\"\n\nWhile taking this iterative, scientific approach to problem-solving seems obvious in theory, in practice well-intentioned people usually get it wrong. There is a venture-funded startup called Get Frank that exhibits many of the flaws I've outlined thus far. Get Frank is meant to be a workplace organizing tool. It hosts a forum for coworkers to use to organize things like petitions to their bosses asking to improve their workplaces. I have not used this product and I do not know the founders; maybe I am way off here, but it seems clear to me that Get Frank is a failure and a product of design thinking.\n\nThe Get Frank product appears to me as if its founder, a product designer from Airbnb, did a design process on workers to understand their needs, then went into an office for a year and built a product with no further feedback from workers. It is highly doubtful that this talented designer first found groups of workers attempting to organize and struggling to do so because of poor technology. If they had, and if they had struggled and organized with such workers, they would have built something more useful and Get Frank's laudatory press coverage wouldn't be about the launch of an empty website but about the victories its users had won. I suspect design thinking stood in for finding real workers and empowering them using technology. The result is a waste of time and talent that we do not have to spare.\n\nNot only must our work be agile but also embedded. \"There is something missing from tech worker organizing,\" writes Carmen Molinari. Issue-driven and guilt-driven organizing among high-wage tech workers have not succeeded. The reality is that not enough of us have skin in the game. Without real stakes, our organizing efforts will remain shallow. Conditions will eventually push us forward–our jobs will be outsourced, our state will burn, our investors will fund police drones , but for now our organizing efforts will remain nascent.\n\nI have been no different. If the cafeteria workers won or lost their union at Facebook my life would not have materially changed. I could only make their plight my plight through emotional entanglement. As part of a union drive I would go to workers' houses along with another worker and an organizer to tell them about the union. I met people's families and saw the homes they would need to leave if they didn't get a contract. If they lost I would cry for them, but I would also be able to walk away.\n\nThis is how it will be until more technologists have a stake in disrupting the status quo instead of maintaining it. Eventually the same forces that led to the de-industrialization of the West will come for us tech workers, too. But if we want to make progress before then, we need to be embedded in the struggles of other workers in a meaningful way. Their problems need to be our problems.\n\nHaving something you don't want to lose sucks. Making the struggle something more than a volunteer shift when you get home from your half-mil-a-year job is painful. Making someone else's struggle truly your own is a risk, but we need to be taking risks. Not a small risk like signing a petition to your CEO. Not a fake risk like joining a post-Series-A startup with a guaranteed soft landing. I mean real risks where it will be devastating if you lose but a victory would inspire other victories at larger and larger scales.\n\nBeing agile and embedded makes priorities crystal clear. Rather than just imagining what tools and features workers fighting for self-determination might need in the abstract, being part of a real workers' struggle sharpens our senses and keeps us on the right path. It allows us to test our theories fast enough to meaningfully improve them. And by being embedded in a real workers' struggle, we will give a shit enough to bring all our talents to bear.\n\nWe've got to stop acting as if we can design away problems from a distance. We aren't going to code our way out of capitalist collapse. And we aren't going to change the world without confronting its masters at the largest possible scale.

It all helps. Thanks!\n\nToday, one of my favourite Martha Gellhorn letters, written in 1983 to her dear but selfish friend, the Hollywood actress Betsy Drake. For the uninitiated, Gellhorn spent much of her adult life travelling the world as a celebrated war correspondent and is best known for her reporting during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. She also knew how to write a letter, hundreds of which have been published in excellent collections such as Selected Letters of Martha Gellhorn (edited by Caroline Moorehead), from which this letter comes, and Yours, for Probably Always (edited by Janet Somerville). Both are highly recommended.\n\nYou are sensitive to your own feelings; you indulge yourself in feelings which are always and exhaustingly about your reactions to people and events. You haven’t the faintest idea about other people’s feelings—how you affect them. You invent complications, you analyse without reason or need very simple occurrences, and you analyse with very little true knowledge of people. It does not occur to you that this is an outrageous burden on others; not friendship but emotional tyranny.\n\nEmotional tyranny, Betsy. The rule, your rule, is: tread softly, by God, or you will disturb my feelings. It’s an enormous stupid tedious bore. You can have all the feelings you want, but the only practical way you can handle this is: cut out the people who distress your feelings and take the rest of the world at face value, the face the world presents, because everyone has enough real problems without getting bogged down in the problems you manufacture.\n\nYou have no idea why I won’t travel with you again. Because, with all your feelings, you have never stopped to look at yourself: a woman who sulks when events don’t work out as desired, who has innumerable absolute needs which are not life and death matters but your absolutes, who has to be kept happy or else by golly it’s miseryville all round.\n\nFriendship is fun and a loose mutual aid society. It isn’t soul-picking (your soul, note) and you’ve made me as furious as I’ve ever been. I won’t have this nonsense and this tyranny. I have never had it from anyone else and I’m not having it any more from you. Try growing up.\n\nFrom Selected Letters of Martha Gellhorn , edited by Caroline Moorehead.

Neighbors held each other and cried. Fathers shook hands and slapped each other’s backs, grins spread wide. That year, their boys had done it: The Permian High School Panthers were state champions. “We were hoarse from screaming and yelling. We didn’t want to leave the field,” quarterback Jerry Hix remembered years later, long after his high school football career had ended. “Nothing can compare. I miss it.”\n\nIt was a moment of indescribable pride for boys who spent the better part of their young lives cracking ribs, ripping tendons, and puking under the Texas sun, working toward a single goal: Excellence at the game of football. It was a moment of pride for the people of Odessa, the few thousand ranchers and oilmen and beauty clerks who scratched out lives in the arid desert, watching and praying over their team.\n\nIt was also a moment from which many of those boys would never recover. “My life’s never been the same since,” said Joe Bob Bizzell, a player who flamed out of college football and retreated to the dirt roads of Odessa. A decade later, he found himself still there, repairing pump jacks on an Amoco oil field.\n\n“You live in a fairy tale for that one year of your life,” said a different player’s wife. “You’re worshipped, and that year is over and you’re like anyone else. We all feel our husbands have been unhappier with everything they got out of it.” Players fell into alcohol abuse and lackluster home lives. Permian High’s athletic trainer called winning a Texas high school football championship the “kiss of death” for teenage boys. “They’re popular. They’re in very hot demand, like a hot rock group. No matter what they do, it’s a hit. Everything they do is right,” he said. “And they just can’t find that again. What other job can they find that has that glamour? What’s the substitute? Find the substitute for it. The only consequence of it is a mentally crippling disease for the rest of your life.” Why am I recounting Pulitzer Prize winner H.G. Bissinger’s reporting in Friday Night Lights ? First, because it is a wonderful book. Second, because as I’ve been re-reading it this week, the story feels uniquely relevant. Bissinger’s nonfiction account of Odessa and its Permian Panthers isn’t just a book about winning football games. It’s a book about the lingering cost of life lived on a pedestal.\n\nFlipping through Twitter last week, this video, “A day in the life of a New York fashion student,” popped into my feed. Watching, it wasn’t memories of NYC, or outfit envy, or nostalgia for my own youth that I first thought of (that came later)—but the boys of Permian High.\n\nBy all objective metrics, this girl is living a fabulous life. She’s beautiful, with nice friends, fantastic clothes, a fun gym routine, and professional success. Her video has been watched 4.1 million times on Twitter. Kate Bartlett has 421,600 followers and 16,300,000 likes on TikTok. That’s very real economic leverage. Employers will race to capture the power of a smart, appealing young woman.\n\nShe’s playing an expert level of the game as it is understood in 2021: Attract an audience. Curate your life. Optimize for beauty and likability. Be authentic, but careful. Precise. That’s how you win.\n\nThe rules of this game were written two decades ago—entirely unwittingly— by pale young men trying to get dates from a Harvard dorm room. In the firehose of faces, you needed a strategy to stand out. The ultimate rule was born: Be something special.\n\nYou can be a champion at anything. Therefore, you must be a champion at something.\n\nLike football, champions are rewarded by a crowd of cheering fans. Fans are where the money comes from: Season tickets and popcorn sales and T-shirts and sponsorship deals. But that audience is no longer a West Texas town of 15,000 neighbors and cousins and friends: It’s billions of blinking eyeballs.\n\nThe game isn’t played in stadiums, but online. It is no longer bound by the friction of the physical world. There are no tryouts. There are no coaches. There is no 4-year time horizon. You cannot graduate from the gridiron of the Internet. 16,300,000 people have watched Kate Bartlett on TikTok. That is 162 different packed crowds at the Darrell K Royal Texas Memorial Stadium at the University of Texas.\n\n16,300,000 people saw her as young and beautiful and smart and successful.\n\n16,300,000 people will expect her to remain that way.\n\nBut if it is irreparably painful to live under the expectations of a crowd for one year—just one season of football—what must it be like to withstand that pressure for…forever?\n\nImagine yourself in college. Could you have handled that audience? My college days were spent blessedly offline. (This is because I was uncool, not because social media wasn’t popular.) I wore some bad outfits, ate mac \u0026 cheese on the floor, brought greasy sacks of McDonald’s into the library, said and did things that I regret. But the stakes were low. I could make mistakes and learn. No one held it against me if I goofed up. I could apologize, figure it out, and be better next time.\n\nIn front of 16,300,000 people, the stakes are high. Mistakes will not be tolerated. Cellulite will not be tolerated. In the game, you must be perfect.\n\nRinging endorsement of “content creators” is everywhere. TikTok is the future of celebrity. OnlyFans is the future of empowerment. Instagram and YouTube remain the keys to the golden castle. A loyal audience is a wellspring of power: cultural, political, or economic.\n\nYou and I are both writers—paid only for our words and ideas. We both make content every day. It pays the rent. I certainly value the dissemination of creative work, understand it to be an important tool, and believe it worthy of compensation and recognition.\n\nBut then I read about the torment a 17-year-old girl endures from 100 million strangers. I read about the eating disorder she’s hidden. I read about the violent threats in her DMs, pings that reach right into the palm of her hand. I listen to her cry . Can you watch this video without feeling sick? Can you really?\n\n“She’s the most powerful influencer in the country! She has it all!” adults will tweet. “She has scale larger than some publicly traded companies! You shouldn’t feel bad for her.”\n\nI think about these adults, strategizing about how to “leverage her brand.” They sit on Zoom calls. They make decks. I wonder if they get death threats.\n\nI think about the systems these adults will build, and finance, and scale. I think about how these systems will impact everyone else, everyone who is not famous, but is now convinced that perhaps they could be. Should be.\n\nI watch this video , a woman filming a dance for TikTok when a stranger appears inside her apartment. He has climbed onto the balcony. She shelters in a neighbor’s apartment until the video ends.\n\nIt’s easy to pretend the digital world is removed from the physical. It is not. I think about the millions of women streaming on OnlyFans. Are they safe? Then I think about myself. Have I tweeted anything that will reveal my home address? What have I posted? Who can find me? I feel sick.\n\nI watch content, and I watch, and I watch, and I have to ask: What are we really advocating for?\n\nThe truth is, we’re advocating for a giant scoreboard—something clear and definitive to measure our worth. Who is up? Who is down? We want the score to always tick higher, more, more, more. We want qualitative proof of recognition and connection and fame. We want to be champions. Here’s a quote I love: “Most of us come to grief because we want too much.”\n\nWanting emerges as a soft white fog, billowing over our thoughts. We love to rationalize it. We frame it as goal setting, as ambitious career plans, as a good reason to spend 10 hours behind a laptop. Of course you want to play the game—that’s how you win. Who doesn’t want to win? The 1972 Permian Panthers were full of wanting: To win for their town, to earn the respect of their peers, to prove they were the best.\n\n“You should set high goals,” the game tells us. “You should be a champion.”\n\nBut look closely: it’s just wanting. “I have 20,000 Twitter followers.” I want to be worthwhile.\n\n“I write 3,000 words every night.” I want to be understood.\n\n“I just negotiated for 6 figures.” I want to be valued.\n\n“I eat organic foods, sleep eight hours a night, meditate, and optimize my work schedule.” I want to be loved.\n\nThe game will not satisfy these wants. When you get too old, or too boring, or too careless on Twitter, the game will be over. It will leave you stranded in Odessa, Texas, alone, checking for rust on oil pumps.\n\nWe’re all in control of how much we play the game. We do not need to be champions. We do not need to watch the scoreboard. We’re allowed to walk off the field, to slam the gate of the stadium behind us. We can exchange the roar of the crowd for the quiet of a dirt field, a place to toss a ball around with a few friends—to play a game that makes us whole rather than leaves us hamstrung.

to avoid half-heartedness - by Ava - bookbear express","link":"https://ava.substack.com/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness?s=r","content":"how to avoid half-heartedness\n\nA few nights ago a friend and I were talking about the moment when someone shows you their texts with their crush and asks you to analyze it with them, i.e. “Do you think that he/she likes me?” I always offer the best analysis I can because I believe it is a sacred duty to indulge your friends’ paranoia (and also I have so, so been there and appreciate people who’ve helped me neurotically analyze meaningless exchanges). HOWEVER, I do feel compelled to state that it doesn’t really matter because if someone likes you it’s usually quite obvious. Especially now that we’re not in middle school and most people are pretty good at using their mouths and thumbs to communicate.\n\nSo: if the person you like likes you back, you can probably tell. If you’re not sure they like you, they’re almost certainly half-hearted or conflicted or lukewarm. And that’s fine! It is really, truly okay if someone is not very into you. The interesting question here is why you care so much: why do you need to obsess over it, why do you need to figure out exactly what’s going on? Why are you so okay with half-heartedness?\n\nMy answer is that if you tolerate too much half-heartedness, it’s probably because you’re half-hearted. As in: anxious and ambivalent, looking for reassurance. As in: bored, along for the ride, not really sure about your own feelings and opinions. As in: external locus of control vs internal locus of control. You probably don’t have anything in your life that really tethers you to yourself—you don’t have conviction about what you love, so you’re hoping that someone else will provide you that certainty.\n\nI think that people come alive when they’re serious about what they love—when they choose to pay careful attention to what feeds and sustains them. I love this one Heather Havrilesky line about how crushes are often just misplaced ambition. Of course crushes are more than that—they’re about nostalgia and magic and futures we’ll never access—but I think they’re also indicative of a desire to place happiness outside of ourselves.\n\nIf you want to be loved, find something you love. People can sense it when you have something you’re dedicated to. No one wants the burden of being the answer to your dissatisfication. When you’re unsure of yourself, it’s easy to be obsessed with the idea of love—the idea that happiness will arrive when someone else loves you. This can lead to you ignoring your own life.\n\nBriana West: “You want [love] to provide for you what you think you cannot give yourself: stability, security, hope, happiness. So long as you function on this belief, you place “love” as being something that is outside of you when the reality is that you cannot see, create, or experience on the outside what you are not already.”\n\nIf you’re serious about what you love, does that mean everyone will love you? Absolutely not. People will continue to kind of like you and like you a little bit and not like you at all. The difference is that it won’t matter so much, because you already have something to pour your love into, something that nourishes you. So you don’t have to spend your time watching everyone else to see if they glance towards you and deign to bestow their love.\n\nYou have so much within you. Pay attention to it. Pay attention to your feelings of discomfort and uncertainty—watch yourself as you think and feel. The thing I like about writing is that it’s quite literally thinking—a way for me access my own interiority and construct something from it. What I write is all mine, it’s a living thing, it’s an extension of me that wanders out into the world. It is desire turned inwards instead of outwards, focused instead of displaced. It’s a way to access self-knowledge and self-respect.\n\nTreat everything that happens to you as material and write it down. Don’t let someone tell you your experience doesn’t matter—you’re the one who gets to decide if it matters. Give yourself agency.\n\nIn a scene from We Play Ourselves, the protagonist, a playwright named Cass, confesses her love to the director she’s been working with, Helene. And in response Helene tells her that her crush is a form of deflection. Later she encourages Cass to “Choose your art, practice your art, always, always choose your art over and above anything else. If you can’t do that, then you have—what, a few more years?”\n\nYou can’t get away with half-heartedness in making art. You can’t believe that something, someone else will be a solution. It never is. If you’re fundamentally ambivalent about yourself no one else can change that relationship. Everything you’re reaching for is just a mirage.\n\nDon’t rely on someone else to give you what you need. Choose what nourishes you every day. See how strong you become when you remember that love is just reassertation, choosing something over and over. Do it one more time \u0026 watch mundane repetition become something transcendent.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

I was recently having The Talk with one particularly distraught student, who was worried her ideas aren’t good enough. “Maybe I’m not cut out for it,” she told me, “or maybe all of the easy ideas have already been done.”\n\nLike her, I’ve worried that I was born too late and all the low-hanging fruit was picked before I got here. Fifty years ago, you could get a million citations just for showing that people like their own team the best , that kids will do something that they watch other people do , or that people think other people agree with them . Everything obvious has been done, and now it’s up to poor schmucks like me to figure out the hard stuff.\n\nLots of people who think hard about the progress of science seem to come to the same conclusion:\n\nAll the low-hanging fruit has already been picked […] it’s almost inconceivable that it could ever be otherwise.\n\n[I]deas naturally get harder to find over time, and we should expect art and science to keep slowing down by default.\n\nThe days when a doctoral student could be the sole author of four revolutionary papers while working full time as an assistant examiner at a patent office — as Einstein did in 1905 — are probably long gone. Natural sciences have become so big, and the knowledge base so complex and specialized, that much of the cutting-edge work these days tends to emerge from large, well-funded collaborative teams involving many contributors.\n\nEveryone agrees: we must resign ourselves either to tweaking what came before or spending our lives descending deeper and deeper into the idea mines, searching for the few nuggets of originality left.\n\nI once found this idea seductive. Now I find it outrageous. It’s not just because it’s wrong; it’s an affront to the human spirit. People only discover stuff when they think it’s worth trying, and there have been entire eras of human history where people didn’t think it was worth trying. A meme like “ideas are getting harder to find” could drive the desire to discover back into hiding again, fulfilling its own abominable prophecy.\n\nSomebody needs to defend the belief that mere mortals can still discover useful truths, and it’s me. I’m here to be that somebody.\n\nIf we’re going to entertain, say, defunding theoretical physics on the grounds that there’s just no more useful physics to do, we should at least ask: could any cognitive biases be at play here?\n\nI can see two. First, all ideas seem obvious in retrospect . Heliocentrism, germ theory, and randomized controlled trials look like no-brainers once someone explains them to you, but they took people thousands of years to figure out. (\"E = mc^2? That’s just three letters and a number!”)\n\nSecond, it’s always going to feel hard to think of new ideas. What should we do next in physics, biology, music, or film? Gosh, I don’t know! I’d have to think pretty hard, just like everybody before me, and I might not come up with anything, just like almost everybody before me.\n\nSo if past ideas seem obvious and future ideas seem obscure, it’s tempting to conclude we live at the inflection point where ideas suddenly get harder to find. And maybe we do. But we’d feel that way even if ideas weren’t getting harder to find, and that should make us a little skeptical.\n\nIf our ancestors also thought they were running out of ideas and were wrong, then we should be wary about thinking the same thing. Our ancestors did think that, and they were wrong.\n\nFor instance, physics was apparently about to end in the 1890s :\n\nMax Planck later remembered a professor telling him that during this period, “the system as a whole stood there fairly secured, and theoretical physics approached visibly that degree of perfection which, for example, geometry has had already for centuries.”\n\nThe British scientist William Cecil Dampier recalled his apprenticeship at Cambridge in the 1890s: “It seemed as though the main framework had been put together once for all, and that little remained to be done but to measure physical constants to the increased accuracy represented by another decimal place.”\n\nBritish physicist J. J. Thomson: “All that was left was to alter a decimal or two in some physical constant.”\n\nAmerican physicist Albert A. Michelson: “Our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth place of decimals.”\n\nThere cannot always be fresh fields for conquest by the knife. There must be portions of the human frame that will ever remain sacred from its intrusion – at least, in the surgeon’s hand. That we have nearly, if not quite, reached these final limits there can be little question.\n\nPsychology was on track to wrap up before 1920 , according to the behaviorist John Watson:\n\nI believe we can write a psychology […] and never go back upon our definition: never use the terms consciousness, mental states, mind, content, introspectively verifiable, imagery, and the like. I believe that we can do it in a few years…\n\nIt was only going to take a couple of dudes and a summer to solve some of the fundamental problems in artificial intelligence:\n\nWe propose that a 2-month, 10-man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The study is to proceed on the basis of the conjecture that every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves. We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.\n\n(They didn’t solve everything but they did start the field of artificial intelligence , so it was still a pretty productive summer, all things considered.)\n\nWhen I wrote recently about how all popular stuff now comes from just a few franchises and superstars , one of the responses on Twitter was:\n\nChart-topping original movies have gone extinct. People have a lot of explanations for this, but they're all incomplete because they don't realize the same thing is happening everywhere. An oligopoly has conquered all of popular culture. https://t.co/9oVoSIlNdj\n\nBut there’s more original content than ever; it’s only popular content that's been dominated by reruns. Clearly, it’s easy to rush to the conclusion that we’re close to the end of ideas, and easy to be wrong.\n\nPessimists seem to think that the universe was born with a long list of discoveries, ordered from easy to hard, like this:\n\nAs time goes on, the thinking goes, more and more of the easy discoveries get crossed off the list, leaving only the hard ones. But knowledge doesn’t work like this at all. Every discovery opens up additional discoveries to make:\n\nWhich in turn lead to more discoveries:\n\nAnd so on.\n\nYou might worry that this means discovery gets harder over time because you have to follow a chain to its end before you can add a new link. Fortunately:\n\nWe can all agree that discovering fire was pretty rad. The first humans to do it probably spent a lot of time learning which kind of kindling was best, how to nurse a spark into a flame, and what sorts of fires were best for cooking vs. heating. They must have painstakingly passed this knowledge from generation to generation, and youngsters had to practice making lots of fires before they got it right.\n\nBut in 2022, I don’t have to do any of that. When I need to cook, I turn on the stove and it makes fire for me. Or I tap a button on my phone and a human makes food for me using their own fire, then they bring it to me. When it gets cold, a fire in the basement turns on, heats up some water, and then the water flows up into the room where I live and makes me warm, too. I don’t really know how any of this works. All the fire-knowledge I’ll ever need is encoded into the innovations that surround me.\n\nThis is how science works, too. To do science, you don’t need to start with the dawn of all human knowledge and then work forward. You start with the current state of knowledge and go from there. Learning the history of science is helpful for shaping your intuitions and giving you perspective, but you don’t actually have to read Darwin, for example, to do evolutionary biology.\n\nThat’s why I’m puzzled by the claim that scientists must labor under an ever-increasing burden of knowledge . The author of that paper writes: “If one is to stand on the shoulders of giants, one must first climb up their backs, and the greater the body of knowledge, the harder this climb becomes.” This suggests that if you peek into PhD programs, you’ll see lots of students bent over their books, desperately trying to learn everything that’s come before so they can start their own projects. “I can’t do any physics yet,” you might hear them lament. \"I’m only up to Huygens !” Instead, you’ll see PhD students doing original research from Day 1—and often long before. Indeed, many students start doing more interesting work once they stop looking at lots of previous work, as it finally frees them from imitating other people and searching for “gaps in the literature,” two strategies that are unlikely to yield anything interesting.\n\nThe world heats up. Stars explode. Species invade. Tectonic plates shift around. The internet upends society. Wars break out, diseases spread, and an ambiguously colored dress turns brother against brother. All of this demands explanation, and we’re the ones who get to explain it, because all the scientists of yore are dead. We probably won’t get far before a whole new deluge of facts arrive, or before we become the scientists of yore.\n\nIt turns out many scientific studies don’t work when you try them again. Lots of cancer studies may be bunk . A coding glitch may have ruined 150 chemistry papers . When the premier journal in social psychology publishes evidence of ESP , you know something is amiss.\n\nThis chaos is a ladder for young scientists. We thought all the juicy, low-hanging fruit had been picked, but now it’s back on the tree, ripe and ready for us to snatch. When we’re standing on the shoulders of giants and they start buckling underneath us, that’s our shot to become the giants.\n\nProfessors delight in telling graduate students that they had to do their data analysis with punch cards, write their dissertations on typewriters, and call up strangers on the phone to ask them to participate in studies. Now you can analyze data by pointing and clicking, write your dissertation in a word processor that fixes your typos for you, and run 1,000 participants in an afternoon on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We’ve got electron microscopes and automatic pipetters and AI-powered transcription and a million other tools that allow us to do research that was impossible or unfeasible even a decade ago. So even if we’re picking the lowest-hanging fruit, we’re standing on an ever-ascending scissor lift.\n\nI’m a psychologist, and I understand that most people aren’t thinking about psychology when they fret about humans running out of ideas, and that psychology hasn’t been a formal discipline as long as the natural sciences have. Still, we’ve certainly been thinking about minds and behavior for a very long time, so if ideas get harder to discover over time, it should be pretty hard to do psychology these days.\n\nLet me tell you: it’s not. I’ve published two papers in what most scientists consider the third-most prestigious journal in all of science. (I think journals are bad, but that’s a story for a different day.) The idea behind the first paper was, quite literally, “ Do conversations end when people want them to? ” The idea behind the second paper was “ Do people know how public opinion has changed? ” These ideas are so low-hanging you could trip over them. My conversation studies could have been run a hundred years ago. My public opinion studies could only have been run recently because we haven’t been measuring public opinion all that long. So one low-hanging idea went unpicked for a century, and another could only have been picked in the last few years.\n\nThe hard part of these ideas wasn’t coming up with them; it was picking them out of a bunch of worse ideas. According to my notes, I pitched 59 research ideas to my advisor over the first two years of my PhD. Only two of these––3%!––became research projects. Of the remaining 97% that went nowhere, only 26% were abandoned because we found out they had been done before. (There’s no guarantee we would have continued them otherwise; finding a previous paper was just a good reason to move on.) Most of the rejected ideas just weren’t that interesting.\n\nIf you’re looking for low-hanging fruit in biology and medicine, see Slime Mold Time Mold . Their contaminant theory of obesity may be revolutionary, and they’ve told me before that their work would have been almost impossible even ten years ago, because most of the sources they use have only recently been published or posted online—that is, the fruit just got lowered. Right now they’re recruiting people to eat nothing but potatoes , the fruit so low-hanging it’s literally underground.\n\nThe abundance of ideas is even more obvious outside science. If ideas were getting harder to find, you might expect that the most successful people are the ones who have discovered something really complicated. Instead, Jeff Bezos was like “what if we sold stuff on the internet” and now he’s the second-richest guy in the world. Zhang Yiming was like “what if people watched short videos,” invented TikTok, and now he’s got $50 billion . Doja Cat was like “ bitch, I’m a cow ” and she just won a few Billboard awards and bought a house worth $2.2 million .\n\nAll of this makes me very skeptical that ideas are getting harder to find. Nobody has ever shown direct evidence to the contrary, and I’m not even sure what that evidence would look like. Instead, most of the research on the topic—including the appropriately-titled “ Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find? ”—simply points out that while the number of researchers has increased, the output per researcher has gone down. I have a lot of objections to this paper, but they’re a little bit technical so I’ve put them in the Appendix below. Suffice it to say that a) their equations and measures seem dubious; b) their results are consistent with other explanations; and c) it actually seems pretty benign and unsurprising that as you add more people to a task, the output per person falls.\n\nI don’t think we’ll actually get far by arguing over the data, because we’ve got the underlying model all wrong. The metaphors we use to describe scientific progress— foraging! mining! drilling! —all assume that each generation of scientists simply does the same thing as the previous generation, just with more complexity and precision. Our ancestors mined the surface; we mine the depths.\n\nThat doesn’t seem quite right. Democritus and Einstein both contributed to physics, but one made claims with words and the other made claims with numbers. Sigmund Freud and Lee Ross were both great psychologists, but one did cocaine and free-associated while the other put people in situations and recorded what they did. Einstein and Ross didn’t simply forage farther or drill deeper than Democritus and Freud; they did something fundamentally different.\n\nYou don’t even have to look across thousands of years to see these qualitative shifts. Twenty years ago it was perfectly acceptable to run a psychology experiment that had thirty participants in each of four conditions, drop a few outliers, do a bunch of statistical tests until one of them spits out p \u003c .05, and publish the results. Now we know how easy it is to get statistically significant results from a few seemingly-innocuous choices like these, and publishing that same paper today would get you laughed off Twitter. I predict—well, I hope!—similar shifts will happen in fields like biology, where it will become ridiculous to make strong claims about humans from lab mice , and in neuroscience, where it will become ridiculous to put people in a big magnetic tube, look at where their brains light up, and claim you’ve discovered consciousness, or something.\n\nScience is not like foraging, mining, or drilling, where we keep doing the same thing and it keeps getting harder. It’s more like discovering an elevator left for us by aliens. At first we have no idea how it works; we get in and push a button, and now we’re climbing dozens of floors in a matter of seconds. We excitedly calculate that, at this rate, we’ll reach outer space in a few hours!\n\nBut at some point, the elevator stops. We try everything, but we can’t get it to go any higher. Eventually we figure out how elevators work and we start building even taller elevators. Another golden age ensues—there’s taller elevators every year!\n\nBut as the elevators get taller, the engineering gets more complicated. We need more elaborate support structures and stronger materials just to keep the elevators from toppling over. Pessimists start proclaiming that we’ll never reach the stars, or even the stratosphere. The elevators simply can’t reach that high!\n\nThe way to go higher, of course, is not to build taller elevators. It’s to invent hot air balloons. Once we discover lighter-than-air travel, it’s easy to fly as high as the highest elevator, and far above it. And when the balloons can’t go any higher, the solution is helicopters. And when the helicopters can’t go any higher, the solution is rocket ships. And when the rocket ships can’t go any higher, the solution is something we haven’t invented yet. No doubt these space conveyances will be complicated, but so were elevators before we knew how they worked.\n\nThis metaphor captures an important truth that other metaphors don’t: not every paradigm shift is going to be equally useful to the average person, or equally impactful on the same dimension. People may point out that while improving elevators helps us build taller apartment buildings, inventing hot air balloons does not. “Science is providing diminishing returns to housing,” they say gravely. That’s true, but once you can build really tall buildings, limits on housing quickly become political rather than technological. For example, 40% of buildings in Manhattan could not be built today because of increasingly strict zoning requirements. (Some of them would be forbidden because they're too tall and contain too much housing!) Once we solve the scientific part of a practical problem, we can’t continue to measure scientific progress by how well we’re doing on that problem.\n\nThomas Kuhn said something like this sixty years ago . He pointed out that scientific fields tend to putter along until people start noticing problems with the prevailing paradigm (“The planets don’t move like the theory says they should!”). Eventually the problems get too big to ignore and the whole field flies into crisis, and things only settle down when someone proposes a new paradigm that can make sense of everything. Then the cycle repeats.\n\nTwo key ingredients in scientific revolutions, then, are noticing problems and taking them seriously. Kuhn assumed scientists do both of those things naturally, and maybe that was true in 1962. But it doesn’t have to be. As fields formalize, they can get very good at ignoring and suppressing problems, delaying revolutions indefinitely.\n\nOne way professional science does this is by preventing divergent thinkers from entering in the first place. The usual way of becoming a scientist is to become a professor, ideally at a wealthy institution that can furnish you with lots of science gizmos and attractive letterhead for your grant applications.\n\nThe path to that prestigious professorship has become ludicrously competitive. Harvard, the ideal first step in an academic career, accepted just 3.19% of undergraduate applicants last year, down from 7.1% in 2012. Harvard doesn't publish overall PhD acceptance rates—the next step on the academic ladder—but the engineering school does and it’s a mere 7% . Only 15%-30% of PhDs who make it through this gauntlet and still want a permanent academic job will actually get one, and very few will be at the fancy places.\n\nTo win one of these coveted positions, then, you need to do everything exactly right from your freshman year of high school onward: get good grades, garner strong recommendations, work in the right labs, publish papers in prestigious places, never make anybody mad, and never take a detour or a break. (I occasionally get emails from high schoolers begging to work in my lab so they can get their name on a paper.) Professors who got their jobs decades ago tell us it wasn’t like this . In this hypercompetitive environment, the most fervent careerists will outcompete everybody else. And fervent careerists don’t produce revolutionary science.\n\nThe other way professional science can prevent problems from accruing is by simply refusing to publish them. Pre-publication peer review has only been popular for about fifty years—the prestigious medical journal The Lancet only started reviewing papers in 1976 . If your paper or grant application threatens to undermine Dr. Tweedledum’s theory, there’s a good chance Dr. Tweedledum is going to review it, and they’re not inclined to be kind. Everybody knows this, of course, so they don't even try. You need publications and grants to survive, so it’s much better to work on something you know will be publishable at the end. This also rules out revolutionary science.\n\nProfessionalized science, then, may force us to keep building elevators even though we can’t get them to go any higher. Weirdos with crazy schemes for hot air balloons simply don’t get jobs; after all, they don’t even have a degree in elevators! Anyone lucky enough to stay in the pipeline has to apprentice under an elevator-builder, so building elevators is all they’ll ever know. Besides, everyone knows that you can’t get helicopter research published in the Journal of Elevators, and the National Elevator Foundation will never give you money to build one. And our esteemed elders assure us that elevators have an excellent track record and the recent slowdown in elevator progress is only because it’s harder to build taller elevators, so really what’s needed is more elevator funding. But even then, they warn, it won’t ever be possible to reach the stratosphere, let alone outer space. We must resign ourselves to looking for discoveries in the sixth place of decimals.\n\n“Ideas are getting harder to find” is a pretty bleak thing to believe. It says, “Look around the world. This is pretty much as good as it gets; the returns start diminishing from here. All the problems you see are unlikely to be solved anytime soon, so you better get used to them.” Why would anyone agree to such a thing without putting up a fight?\n\nI think, deep down, part of us wants to believe it, because pessimism is really a clever excuse for cowardice. If you believe people are evil, you can be excused from ever trying to befriend them and maybe being rejected. If you believe the world is stacked against you, nobody can blame you for always playing it safe. And if the easy ideas have already been taken, you can’t be expected to come up with anything new.\n\nI don’t blame people for using pessimism as an opiate; we could all use some relief right now. Wages are stagnant, inequality is rising, and if you don’t have a house yet, good luck buying one. The government is sometimes run by people you dislike; the rest of the time it’s run by people you hate. People are dying of preventable diseases while other people are launching cars into space. Everything’s on fire and nobody’s doing anything about it. This doesn’t seem like a world where much is possible, so why not lower your expectations?\n\nBut if we want a better world, we have to believe it’s possible to create one. And that takes courage, because if you truly believe in a better world, you have to do something about it. You don’t get to smugly smirk as the ship sinks; you have to start pumping the water out. Smirking seems easier than pumping at first, but pumping turns out to be really fun. You start to feel useful. You make friends with the other people trying to keep the boat afloat. You stop caring about all the people who say what you’re doing will never work. Ultimately, pumping is way easier than smirking, and it feels better too. Optimism cures pain; pessimism, like painkillers, merely dulls it.\n\nThe way I see it, if you want to write a song the world hasn’t heard before, you have two choices. You can spend your time calculating how there’s only a finite amount of different melodies, so eventually humans will run out of songs to write, so why bother. Or you can pick up a guitar and play.\n\nThis paper by Bloom, Jones, Van Reenen, and Webb claims that ideas are getting harder to find. They summarize their argument like this:\n\nThere’s something very strange about this equation. It implies that the only way to get negative economic growth—that is, a recession—is for either research output or the number of researchers to be negative, which seems unlikely to happen. But if both are negative, economic growth is positive! Clearly, the relationship between researchers, productivity, and economic growth is a lot more complicated, and that makes me doubt that economic measures do a good job capturing the progress of science.\n\nI’ve got three other gripes with this paper. First, it casually swaps correlation and causality, assuming that increasing numbers of researchers have been necessary for maintaining the same level of productivity. For instance:\n\n...this growth has been achieved by engaging an ever-growing number of researchers to push Moore’s Law forward. In particular, the number of researchers required to double chip density today is more than 18 times larger than the number required in the early 1970s. At least as far as semiconductors are concerned, ideas are getting harder to find.\n\nThis isn’t evidence that making better computer chips required additional researchers. We don’t know what the growth rate would have been if we had kept the number of researchers the same.\n\nMy second gripe is that the theory seems to explain too much. The authors find research productivity slowing down everywhere they look, which they interpret as robust evidence for “ideas getting harder to find.” Even if ideas really were finite and get harder to find over time, should we really expect that to be happening in every single field in this exact time period? There isn’t a single discipline where some breakthrough led to a period of increased productivity? Some of these fields, remember, are way younger than others. Shouldn’t we expect some of them to still have lots of easy ideas left, and others to have fully entered their twilight stage, where there are only extremely hard ideas remaining? Science has been going on for a while, so why should this be happening only in our lifetimes, and not fifty years before or after? This seems like a pretty extraordinary coincidence.\n\nWhich brings me to my final gripe: the paper interprets any drop in research productivity as “ideas getting harder to find.” But that’s just one explanation; there are lots of plausible alternatives. Ben Southwood suggests it may be because industrial labs were replaced with less efficient academic departments, or because geniuses don’t go into research anymore, or because lead poisoning is making us dumber. Jay Bhattacharya and Mikko Packalen think it’s because scientists have become obsessed with citations , which leads them to do incremental rather than revolutionary work. They illustrate their theory with this extremely charming figure:\n\nThese explanations sound plausible to me. And I’d go even further. Above a pretty low threshold, we should expect per capita productivity to drop whenever we add more people.\n\nSay you get two guys to remodel your kitchen, and they tell you they can do it in two weeks. “Perfect,” you say. “I’ll just hire 2000 guys, and the job will be done in about 20 minutes!”\n\nThat won’t work, of course, for all sorts of reasons. (Though it does make a good episode of Nathan for You .) You can’t fit that many people in your kitchen—even 20 guys would be bumping into each other all the time. It’s unlikely that the 2000th contractor you hire is going to be as good as the first. Working with that many people requires lots of management and planning. The work can’t be done entirely in parallel—you can only hang the light fixtures after the wiring is done, for example. And some things simply can’t be sped up: paint just takes a while to dry, no matter how many people are waiting around.\n\nSome of the same problems may arise in science. It takes a lot of work to manage lots of researchers, which is why people who lead big labs today spend much of their time being CEOs, fundraisers, and human resources managers rather than scientists. A few individuals may disproportionately drive progress, so adding researchers might actually decrease progress per capita. Some fields may be stymied until progress is made in other fields. And some science simply can’t be sped up: humans age, bacteria multiply, and light waves travel at the same rates no matter how many people are studying them.\n\nPlus, researchers have lots of perverse incentives that remodelers don’t. The remodelers all want the same thing and are willing to follow the same plan and take direction from a supervisor. Researchers, on the other hand, compete with each other. They might steal each other’s ideas, or purposefully tank each other’s papers and grant proposals. Their jobs depend on them looking productive, so they pump out pointless papers to lengthen their CVs. These problems only grow as researchers multiply and the field gets more competitive.\n\nThat’s why I wouldn’t find it very surprising if per capita research output has dropped as the number of researchers has increased. It isn’t convincing evidence that ideas are getting harder to find. I still think we have a big problem, but it’s a solvable social problem, rather than an unsolvable scientific problem.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

Need to Talk about the Software Engineer Grind Culture | by Constance Xu | May, 2022 | Level Up Coding","link":"https://levelup.gitconnected.com/we-need-to-talk-about-the-software-engineer-grind-culture-801f3c3613aa","content":"We Need to Talk about the Software Engineer Grind Culture\n\nWhen I was in college, I found myself constantly trying to find the highest paying job or the most elusive role. This landed me nearly a hundred interviews and it was so much work that I had to quit my part time job to interview. At the time of interviewing, I was taking four credits total at my college and I had to quit a 20 hour/week commitment to my job at one of the biggest banks in the world.\n\nTrust me, I get it. The software engineer interview grind is real. But that grind it seems also carries into my work. Granted, working in big tech has its advantages. There are days that feel so slow, where I might not even write a line of code. On the flip side, there are days where I skip lunch (Yes, even remotely working, I skip lunch so I can help debug code, attend a meeting, etc.) just so I can work!\n\nThere is not a job in the world that pays anyone enough to skip meals we need to eat. My boyfriend is an officer in the Army, and there were plenty of days that he would come home from work with an untouched lunch. He tells me just how busy his day was and how nobody got released for lunch, so no one in his platoon ate lunch. I thought to myself, what could be so important that you cannot stop and eat?\n\nWhen I started working fulltime, I realized I got into a habit of skipping lunch as well. I work pacific coast hours from Texas, and sometimes a meeting will go straight through my lunchtime and then I have back-to-back meetings, and suddenly, it is 6PM , and time for dinner.\n\nSWE culture can be very toxic. Generally, I found that people who get rewarded within software engineering are those who sacrifice their personal time for their project/job. We reward people who code an entire project in 24 hours (I mean, just think about the popularity of hackathons). I remember watching a TikTok from a tech creator and he said that US software engineers are paid so much not because of what they do during work hours, but because of all of the extra work they do outside of it. Ask yourself: are you paid enough to sacrifice your life outside of work?\n\nSo many of us are conditioned to this rat race. I realized that this grind has caused me to lose out on any hobbies outside of coding. There are so many software engineers who are also tech creators on the side. Whether they have a twitch channel dedicated to coding, making Youtube videos about coding, or a tech content creator on TikTok, it usually has something to do with this specialization in software engineering. The reason these channels are so successful is because we, as software engineers, have bought into this narrative.\n\nAsk someone in the US how they would describe themselves, and they will tell you their occupation first (I’m a lawyer, doctor, engineer, etc.). While I agree that our jobs have an impact on who we are, I don’t agree that this is the way we should be describing ourselves.\n\nI want to be a multifaceted person. Yes, for my profession, I am a software engineer, but that is not who I am. Currently, I write articles for Medium (hello!), I crochet, and I go to the gym. I would like to become a self-described gym rat and become a better cook. I want hobbies that steer completely away from coding.\n\nFurthermore, I have started to give myself a better work-life balance. While my company is known for great work-life balance and my team encourages it, sometimes I find myself working when I don’t need to be. It is a self-enforced, I-need-to-get-this-done mentality when really, there is no urgency in getting it done at all. The boundaries that we set within our job will carry on with everything else that we do, so I believe that we all need to set clear, healthy boundaries between work and life. Because at the end of the day, your job is just your job and you only get one life to live.\n\nRecommended from Medium\n\nHow to get unstuck while coding\n\nThe Story of an Exchange Dispenser Machine\n\nSoftware engineer @ Microsoft.

History may repeat itself, but there’s an awful lot of history that this particular venture capital cycle could repeat. Below is a short history of venture capital in the 1980s, my interpretation and comparison to the ’90s and today, and some thoughts about what that means. It’s long. If you’re attention-deprived, skip to ‘1980s v. 1990s’, about four-fifths of the way down.\n\nBaby, baby drove up in a Cadillac I said, “Jesus Christ, where’d you get that Cadillac?”\n\nThey started out well. The recovery from the 1973-1975 recession brought unemployment down and incomes up. But all this was undone by the return of inflation. By 1980, when inflation reached its peak, unemployment was rising, interest rates were at their highest levels since World War II, productivity growth had slowed, and business investment was falling. Fear ruled the markets, a “crisis of confidence” ruled the people.\n\nVenture capital had a different trajectory in the 1970s: until 1978 there was almost nothing, then suddenly, it took off.\n\nOne of the reasons for venture capital’s current heady successes is the good judgment men like Burr [Craig Burr of Burr, Egan, Deleage] and Cronin [Dan Cronin of Ampersand Associates] learned while slugging their way through the near-dormant mid-’70s. The period between 1972 and 1978 may someday be remembered as venture capital’s years in the desert. After a heady adolescence in the late ’60s, the business almost disappeared from public view after the bull market of 1968-69 went into eclipse, taking with it the new-issues market that had buoyed the venture business.

Magazine, “ The Billion Dollar Gamble “, 9/1/1981)\n\nThe pioneers of the 1960s and 1970s had figured out a winning formula: build a great network to source opportunities, spend months getting to know the management team and doing due diligence, invest at the earliest possible stage, work hard to help founders get the right team in place and put together partnerships, and take the company public only when it was ready to be a public company. The result was that, despite an IPO market that had virtually disappeared, iconic VC-backed companies made it out into the market. Cray and Tandem in 1976, Evans \u0026 Sutherland and Federal Express in 1978, and Apple and Genentech in 1980. The Reagan years looked promising.\n\nNever for money, always for love… I guess this must be the place.\n\nBy 1981 economic triumphalists were crowing that the ’80s were to be the “decade of the entrepreneur.”\n\nIt adds up to quite a boom, recalling the late 1960s. Though final figures aren’t tallied, about twice as many high-tech companies were started in 1980 as in 1979, drawn by the twin lures of plentiful venture capital and the dazzling market debuts of two former venture companies in electronics and genetic engineering: Apple Computer Inc. and Genentech, respectively. (Wall Street Journal, “Venture Capitalists Rush in to Back Emerging High-Technology Firms”, 3/18/1981.)\n\nThere’s so much money chasing these deals that venture capitalists are in competition with each other. They spend their energies marketing themselves instead of screening the deals. It’s gotten silly. 1\n\nMoney had been pouring into venture capital since a 1978 change in regulations allowed pension funds to consider it a “prudent” investment. The $2.5 billion managed by venture capital firms in 1977 quintupled by 1983 to $12 billion. 2 New money committed per year rose 16x over five years, from $218 million in 1978 to $3.6 billion in 1983. 3 The number of venture funds grew from 47 in 1980, to 71 in 1982, to 113 in 1983. The number of investment professionals nearly tripled, from 597 in 1977 to 1,494 in 1983.\n\nThe economy started to improve. The new Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, appointed by Carter in 1979, had taken the politically unpopular move of raising interest rates to combat inflation, to 20% by mid-1981. It was painful, but it worked: by 1983 the decade of stagflation was over. The IPO markets celebrated with their biggest year since 1969. A Carter appointee had delivered on Reagan’s promise: it was Morning Again in America.\n\nVenture investments got competitive, and more expensive. “We have less time to make up our minds,” said Eugene Kleiner in a Wall Street Journal article, “It used to be that you had two or three months. Now it’s a matter of weeks or even days, because if we don’t somebody else will.” 4 VCs started to invest ever earlier in a company’s lifecycle to try and avoid competitive term-sheets.\n\nMore and more these days, venture capitalists are financing the birth of new companies. The typical venture-capital concerns used to provide money only after a few hundred thousand dollars or more had been put into a business by relatives and principals, and only after the company had a product well along in development. But now the values of young companies are rising so rapidly that venture capitalists who invest at the traditional stage often can’t make the five to tenfold profit they typically require. (Wall Street Journal, “To Increase Profits, Venture-Capital Firms are Investing Earlier in Fledgling Concerns”, 10/31/1983.)\n\nThe later stages of financing are becoming very crowded, so the best opportunity is to come in with seed money, or to invest even before the company has a business plan. 5\n\nPrices for startups rose. “The price tags on such companies are running from 20% to 100% higher than last year’s first-round financings,” said the Wall Street Journal in 1981. 6 Some attributed the rise in prices to lack of experience.\n\nA tendency by newcomers to overestimate the value of new companies has contributed to the recent sharp rise in the size of some deals…some veterans are dropping potential deals because they’re wary of the competence of other venture capitalists involved in the deal. (Wall Street Journal, “Venture Firms Lack People of Experience”, 12/8/1983.)\n\nAlmost two-thirds of VCs in 1983 had not been in the business five years before, they had very little venture investing experience. And yet the amount of capital each managed doubled, on average, from $4 million in 1977 to $8 million in 1983.\n\nHalf the people in the industry have only two years’ experience. “That isn’t sufficient at all.”\n\nSo the 1983 IPO window was a godsend. Amgen, Biogen, LSI, Apollo, Compaq, Lotus Development, Businessland, Trilogy, Stratus, Paychex, Chiron, and a host of other VC-backed companies went public in 1983, far more than in any year previously. Industry folklore reported investment returns of between 30-50% per year. 8 It was a watershed year for venture capital.\n\nNaturally, that’s when things started to go wrong.\n\nThere’s bum trash in my hall and my place is ripped I’ve totaled another amp, I’m calling in sick It’s an anthem in a vacuum on a hyperstation Daydreaming days in a daydream nation\n\nThe bull market for tech stocks was short-lived. In 1984, the Wall Street Journal noted\n\n“High” and “tech” are still a pair of four-letter words to a lot of money managers and individual investors. They remember the high-tech bubble of 1982 and 1983, when infinite price/earnings ratios were commonplace and anything ending in “onics” was oversubscribed. They also remember the high-tech crash of 1984, and the screams of pain up and down Wall Street. (Wall Street Journal, “High-tech Issues Again Begin to Brave Perils of the Once-Fertile Market for Initial Offerings”, 11/13/1984.)\n\nThis wasn’t a bubble. Prices had briefly gone up, as the Journal had noted in 1981, and then they declined:\n\nFor the first time since the boom in venture capital began five years ago, prices are falling in all stages of high-technology finance. Venture money is still abundant, and the private market value of some young companies are continuing to rise. Overall, however, venture investors are paying 20% less for deals than a year ago; for companies that haven’t lived up to their promise, prices are off by 50% or more. (Wall Street Journal, “Venture Capitalists Pay Less to Invest in High-Tech Firms”, 5/4/1984.)\n\nIn 1984 companies suddenly found it was again hard to go public.\n\n1986 was a bit better, and firms like Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, Adobe, and Cypress Semiconductor took advantage of the opportunity, but the IPO market grew sluggish again after that. Tech IPOs peaked at 173 in 1983, a level they would not reach again for twelve years.\n\nVenture returns started to fall. From a peak of about 30% median IRRs in 1982 and 1983, IRRs slid all the way down to about 8% in 1988.\n\nThe drop-off was entirely attributable to recently raised funds. Returns from funds raised in 1980 peaked in 1983 with an almost 20% cumulative return (the pre-1980 funds did even better.) 1981 was respectable. But funds raised in 1982 and after showed abysmal early returns through the ’80s.\n\nObservers started casting blame: frequently on venture capitalists paying too much, or on inexperienced VCs.\n\nOverpaying is an obvious explanation. Increased competition for deals may have driven prices up and returns down. But high prices in the early ’80s can’t account for the poor return of later vintages, so that can only be part of the explanation.\n\nIt’s also easy to believe that newcomers might just not be very good investors yet, that they would need some time to learn how to invest well. But poor returns weren’t limited to new VCs: returns broken out between first-time venture funds and follow-on funds show both the noobs and the experienced producing similarly dismal results. 9\n\nThe poor performance of newer venture capital funds reflects that fewer companies are going public, and some are forced to go public at low prices. 10\n\nNew money managers have a unique problem, though. They need to show they can make their LPs money before they go to raise a new fund. They need exits. Some observers claimed that new VCs were “grandstanding”: demonstrating their ability to exit by exiting too soon, especially through IPOs. 11 By forcing their companies to go public before they were ready, they ended up with sub-optimal IPOs. This not only hurt the VCs involved, but it poisoned the well for other companies hoping to go public.\n\n“Venture capital looked like a very easy business” in the boom times, but “venture capital has never been an easy business. There’s a lot of heartaches and a lot of hard problems to solve to create a durable enterprise.”\n\nBut the biggest problem, in hindsight, was that the sectors that had produced the best returns in the early ’80s were no longer delivering. Investors scrambled, betting on any idea that showed evidence of being able to become a winning business, no matter if it was technology or not.\n\nThe computer hardware boom had quietly ended as each category settled on an architecture. Soon after IBM released their personal computer in 1981, for example, the basis of PC hardware competition moved from product innovation to manufacturing and marketing efficiencies. 13 Scores of companies trying to define what the personal computer would be were whittled down to just a few trying to market slightly faster and smaller machines to specific markets at ever lower prices. From PC design innovators like Apple, startup activity moved to efficient manufacturers and marketers like Dell and Gateway. Like the mainframe and minicomputer industries before them, and with the workstation market right on its heels, the PC hardware industry had moved from radical to incremental innovation.\n\nSo by January 1984 investors had turned away from hardware towards software.\n\nComputer software companies are currently appealing to venture capitalists because their role in the personal computer industry is booming and appears somewhat less risky that the computer hardware market, which is undergoing a shakeout. (Wall Street Journal, “Software Companies Attracting Investors as Industry Booms”, 1/3/1984.)\n\nBut these VCs were already late to the market. By 1984 the big software wins of the 1980s were already founded or public. Computer Associates (founded 1974) went public in 1981; Lotus Development Corp. (founded 1982) in 1983; VM Software (founded 1981) in 1985; Adobe (founded 1982), Oracle (founded 1977), and Microsoft (founded 1975) in 1986; BMC (founded 1980) in 1988; Electronic Arts (founded 1982) in 1989.\n\nThe people who knew better noticed this immediately. Just a month after the previous article, the Journal reported Mitch Kapor saying “There are going to be some major nose dives, some will pull out, some will crash and burn.” Robin Grossman of Sevin Rosen Management, one of the top VC firms of the era, said “Venture money is already drying up…lots of investors will be disappointed.” 14 Just nine months later, in November 1984, Benjamin Rosen, arguably the best VC of the era, wrote off the whole sector: “Soaring marketing costs, intense competition and an unfavorable stock market…make the success of new personal software companies highly questionable.” 15\n\nOver the past five years, venture capitalists have been chastened by large losses on an estimated $500 million in a dozen now-unsuccessful makers of mini-supercomputers. 16\n\nOther high-tech areas of focus also did not pan out. Despite being the natural evolution of decades of product trends, almost none of the mini-supercomputer firms survived. Artificial intelligence was a bust:\n\nThe AI industry, which many market researchers had projected would reach $4 billion in annual sales by now, remains nascent. Generous estimates of the market today are closer to $600 million. After swallowing up hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital…hundreds of AI start-ups have yielded only a few profitable public companies. (Wall Street Journal, “Bright Outlook for Artificial Intelligence Yields to Slow Growth and Big Cutbacks”, 7/5/1990.)\n\nBiotech, the great hope of the end of the ’70s, had fallen out of favor; progress was slow: the 1989 revenues of the top ten biotech companies was less than $1 billion in aggregate, with combined losses of about $33 million. 17 Pen-based computing, interactive television, and superconductors did not pan out. Parallel computing was too early. 18\n\nThe disk drive industry (called then “Winchester disk drives”) deserves a few paragraphs just by itself 19 because it illustrates a recurring theme: VCs reacting to a few successful companies by massively over-funding the sector.\n\nThe success of one company in an area such as disk drives or semiconductors immediately spawned a plethora of me-too deals in the same business. 20\n\nThe disk drive industry had been rapidly growing for several years. Few PCs had them in the early ’80s but they became standard as prices dropped. Between 1978 and 1983, sales in the OEM market grew from $27 million to approximately $1.3 billion, and were projected to continue growing to $4.5 billion by 1987. Companies like Memorex, Control Data, and Storage Technology were big winners. When it became clear how well they were doing, more companies were formed and funded.\n\nDave Marquardt…made a half-million investment in Seagate in May 1980. When Seagate went public in the Summer of ’81, that half-million was suddenly worth twenty million. 21\n\nIn 1981, 12 disk drive companies were founded and received venture capital. In 1982, 19 companies; in 1983, 22 companies. Almost $400 million was invested in the industry between 1977 and 1984, $270 million of that in 1983 and 1984 alone. By 1983 there were more than 70 companies competing in the industry. In response to the increase in competition, prices were slashed and margins fell dramatically, but fixed R\u0026D expenses did not. The valuations of these companies collapsed.\n\nThere are more than 64 floppy-disk makers. Perhaps that’s too many. That’s just a personal observation.\n\nVenture investors have always flocked to sectors that begin to show promise. There were a plethora of funded PC manufacturers, for instance. Individual companies in these over-funded sectors still succeed, 23 but overfunding causes overall low returns. In the 1980s this was exacerbated by the sheer number of new VCs, their fear of missing out on what might be a career-defining win, and the few promising sectors that appeared.\n\nThere are fewer high-tech deals that are perceived to be hot.\n\nIn retrospect, we can see new areas on the horizon: Cisco was founded in 1984; 25 AOL in 1985; Thinking Machines unveiled its first massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine, in 1986. But it was not obvious at the time how these ideas would generate new markets; it was too early.\n\nSpeaking at the 1990 Venture Forum, John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins illustrated the industry’s frantic search for an innovative sector that could sustain it.\n\nThe business grew too fast, there were too many people trying to do technology start-ups.\n\n[Doerr] went on to contend that…pessimism is all wrong because the business is not a zero-sum game and several significant trends will create opportunities for billion-dollar companies in the 1990s. Doerr believes the most promising opportunities include instrumentation for human gene screening, the development of more effective pharmaceutical products for the aging population, a new generation of audiovisual, pen-based computing, new discoveries in neurobiology, and automated designer chemicals. 27\n\nIf an interviewer asked John Doerr a few years later about the most promising opportunities, he would have had a clear and concise answer (Doerr backed Netscape and Amazon.com in the early ’90s.) But between 1984 and 1992 there was no clear answer.\n\nPension funds and others who stake VCs can’t really know how poorly their venture investments are doing until years after the fact. So even as returns on recent funds went negative in 1985-1989, money kept pouring into venture; VCs had to figure out something to do with it.\n\nYou might as well go for the safer and more current return because you do have the time value of money. I am being penalized for being a long-term investor.\n\nVCs figured that, absent blockbuster companies, IRRs could be improved either by shortening holding periods or having a higher company survival rate. Despite learning in the 1970s that early-stage investing is where the returns are, firms in the 1980s started to invest at much later stages and in already-established markets.\n\nThe venture capital industry, which has nurtured the growth of hundreds of high-technology companies such as Apple Computer, Genentech and Lotus Development, is shifting its focus to more mundane investments that have little to do with technological innovation or creating new jobs.\n\nDiscount stores, pizza shops, athletic apparel concerns and a host of companies that provide personal and business services are increasingly competing for funds with biotechnology ventures and computer concerns.\n\nAt the same time, more than a third of the $3.4 billion raised by venture capitalists last year [1986] appears to have been earmarked for leveraged buyouts, in which loans used to finance the acquisition of a company are secured with the assets of the company being acquired. Such buyouts invest in established companies rather than underwriting new ones.\n\n”It may not be good for the country, but the fact is that technology has not been as rewarding as other forms of investment,” said Kenneth W. Rind, a partner in Oxford Partners, a large venture capital firm in Stamford, Conn. (New York Times, “High Tech’s Glamour Fades for Some Venture Capitalists”, 2/6/1987.)\n\nAmerica’s venture capital industry has been restructuring itself in a way that is eroding its historic role as a source of seed money…venture capitalists have been putting a greater share of their money in later-round financings and LBOs. 29\n\nFrom none in 1980, LBOs grew to 23% of VC dollars by 1986. Seed and early-stage financing, once a quarter of VC investment, fell to 12.5% by 1988.\n\nMany of the top firms moved either entirely or partly to LBOs: J.H. Whitney \u0026 Co. (one of the original VC firms, in the business since 1946); Patricof Associates (Alan Patricof returned to the VC fold in 2006 with his current fund Greycroft Partners); Welsh, Carson, Anderson \u0026 Stowe; Warburg Pincus; Merrill, Pickard, Anderson \u0026 Eyre; Bain Capital; and TA Associates were some of the more prominent. Even Sequoia started backing LBOs.\n\n“We still want to invest in new ideas, but we will do it through more mature companies.”\n\nInstead of backing entrepreneurs to develop new companies, many deal makers are emphasizing investments in companies that plan to grow through acquisitions…the growth of the venture capital industry is making it harder to find worthy new companies to support. So they have to find other place to put their money. (Wall Street Journal, “Venture Capital Turns to Mergers For Faster Growth and Lower Risk”, 1/7/1986.)\n\nAs veteran venture capitalist Fred Adler put it: “Venture capital has more parts than it used to. We’re a lot more flexible about how we use our money.” (ibid.)\n\nEven when VCs were investing in startups, the companies were unlike the ones that had generated the phenomenal 1980 VC returns. The new wisdom was to lower risk by investing in well-understood, slower growth markets. VCs also limited risk by shunning technology.\n\nSome of the hottest venture deals these days are being done in a field that is mostly low-tech or even no-tech: specialty retailing…most of these smaller outfits are trying to carve their niche with the same basic strategy of lavishing tremendous amounts of personal attention on the customer. To use the emerging buzzword, they seek to be “full-service” retailers. (Wall Street Journal, “‘Full-Service’ Specialty Retailers Draw Venture Capital”, 5/1/1989.)\n\nVCs backed companies like Staples (founded 1985) and Starbucks (founded 1985), despite their high capital requirements and lack of barriers to entry.\n\nIn the past 12 months, venture capitalists have invested a hefty $18.5 million in Staples, Inc…but in the same period—apparently lured by [Staples’] initial success—an estimated $10 million has been invested in at least five competing start-ups. (Wall Street Journal, “Retail Start-Up Decides to Start Out Big”, 5/14/1987.)\n\nAs in the high-tech sectors, initial success was followed by over-funding.\n\nOne of the hottest venture capital investment ideas—bankrolling office-supply discount chains—is starting to sour. In the past two years, investors poured nearly $200 million into at least 16 office-supply “supermarket” chains. But today, the flood of entrants threatens a market-share war, and the result may be hard times. Several companies seem to be faltering, and at least two have closed. (Wall Street Journal, “Growth in Office-Supply ‘Supermarkets’ Threatens Tough War for Market Share”, 12/1/1988.)\n\nTop funds, like US Venture Partners and NEA, moved “from their traditional high-tech portfolios into specialty retailing and consumer product investments.” 31 VCs had always backed retail companies (Jiffy Lube in 1979, for instance) but the volume of these deals increased. Consumer was the largest single VC investment category, by dollars, in 1984. 32 And it was the largest category of VC-backed IPOs in 1984, 1985, and 1986. 33 One unnamed venture capitalist said in the Journal “Although the prospects for unusually big hits like Apple and Sun are small, you can get good results with greater consistency.” 34 This turned out to be wishful thinking.\n\nWhile consumer related and ‘other products and services’ grew as a percent of VC disbursements, semiconductors, computer hardware, and communication shrank. Software and services did not start to take off until the ’90s.\n\nBy the end of the decade venture capitalists started to admit that the attempt to create predictable returns had failed.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, many [venture capitalists] experimented with investments in such low-tech industries as specialty retailing. Results were generally disappointing, in part because the financiers often didn’t understand what they were getting into. (Wall Street Journal, “Venture Capitalists Find Low-Tech Firms Appealing”, 6/20/1991.)\n\nVCs acknowledged their inability to get venture capital returns in low-tech businesses by investing in more low-tech businesses:\n\nSeeking greater safety, some venture capitalists say they increasingly invest in food retailing and distribution, waste management and other areas where emerging technology generally isn’t a factor. (ibid.)\n\nVCs disliked high-technology because the high-tech sectors of the day were poor candidates for venture. Investments in cable-TV and cell-phone infrastructure could never have achieved the types of returns that an Apple Computer or Genentech did, because they required so much capital. (Even though capital-intensive companies like Federal Express had gone on to be successful IPOs in the 1970s, they were still bad investments for their early backers. 35 ) Early stage investors, what few remained by the late 1980s, lowered their sights to avoid being crushed by future capital requirements. In biotech they gave up even trying to build self-sustaining companies that might one day go public.\n\nInstead of building corporations and taking them public one day, these venture capitalists now develop companies purely for sale to big corporations. They make smaller investments for shorter periods than in the past. More than ever…they limit their risks and focus on developing products rather than companies. (Wall Street Journal, “Biotech Start-Ups are Increasingly Bred Just to be Sold”, 7/19/1989.)\n\nThe VC investing landscape had, essentially, bifurcated. One group of VCs made small, earlier investments and tried to manage their risk by investing in established markets or by building products, not companies; another group made much larger, later investments and tried to manage their risk by investing in companies that were not “startups” at all.\n\nThe initial successes of the venture industry in the first half of the decade have led to an excess of “megafunds”—venture pools with hundreds of millions of dollars to invest. The sheer size of these funds has, in many instances, transformed seed capital from a primary activity to a marginal one. (Wall Street Journal, “Venture Capital’s New Look”, 5/20/1988.)\n\nThe number of risk takers is decreasing.\n\nVenture capitalists’ job is to invest in risky projects. But after shying away from risk for years, VCs finally found there was no longer anybody willing to found a risk-taking company. The number of high-tech starts plummeted.\n\nIt looked, for a time, like high-tech was done. Marc Andreessen recently described the Silicon Valley he moved to in 1994:\n\nIt was dead. Dead in the water. There had been this PC boom in the ’80s, and it was gigantic—that was Apple and Intel and Microsoft up in Seattle. And then the American economic recession hit—in ’88, ’89—and that was on the heels of the rapid ten-year rise of Japan. Silicon Valley had had this sort of brief shining moment, but Japan was going to take over everything. And that’s when the American economy went straight into a ditch. You’d pick up the newspaper, and it was just endless misery and woe. Technology in the U.S. is dead; economic growth in the U.S. is dead. (New York Magazine, “ In Conversation: Marc Andreessen “, 10/19/2014.)\n\nBut, as every good contrarian knows, things are darkest before the dawn.\n\nI woke up early, couldn’t go back to sleep Cause I had been thinking of where it all would lead… There’s a big day coming, about a mile away There’s a big day coming, and I can hardly wait.\n\nIt changed fast. A headline in the Wall Street Journal in August 1991 moaned “Venture Capital Funding for Small Companies Plunges.” 37 A year later the headline read “Venture Funds Regain Appetite for Start-Ups.” 38 Start-ups were back in favor.\n\nWhat happened? Well, you know what happened. The Internet happened.\n\nIn 1993, investor interest in…young companies often focused on the new media and communications industry segments. The spotlight on new media and the emerging information superhighway helped early stage companies. (Wall Street Journal, “Firms Backed by Venture Capitalists Do Well in IPOs”, 1/14/1994.)\n\nThe technologies enabling “New Media” were not new. AOL and Cisco were both formed in the ’80s. The fiber optics that became the backbone of the “information superhighway” had also been laid in the ’80s 39 and the multimedia capabilities of PCs were the result of years of work. 40\n\nThe catalyst for the 1990s revolution was the invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. In January 1993, Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina released the first version of Mosaic, an open-source Web browser. Also in 1993, CERN announced the Web was free for anyone to use, at just the time when the NSF freed the academic Internet to connect with commercial networks. The 1990s had begun, high-tech was saved.\n\nConsumer adoption of the Web created some early winners. AOL went public in 1992; Netcom in 1994; UUNet, Spyglass and Netscape in 1995; Lycos, Excite, Yahoo!, CompuServe, Infoseek, C/NET, and E*Trade in 1996; and Amazon, ONSALE, Go2Net, N2K, NextLink, and SportsLine in 1997. Then IPOs got crazy. Ten Internet IPOs in 1995 turned into 18 in 1996, 15 in 1997, and 40 in 1998; but in 1999 there were 272. Even in 2000 there were 148, despite the stock market crash of March of that year (in 2001 reality sank in and there were only 6 Internet IPOs.) 41\n\nThe large early stock price gains by Netscape, Amazon, and others rewoke investors to the potential of technology stocks and they bid up any company that had any involvement with the Internet. Private tech companies took advantage of the market opportunity by going public and investors bought these up too. These companies could not yet be evaluated on objective measures like earnings, so investors used the rising stock prices as the rationale to keep buying. Anyone who questioned the sustainability of prices was told they just didn’t “get it.” 42\n\nEntrepreneurs and venture investors struggled to satisfy the appetite of IPO investors. They took startups to market before they had proved their long-term viability, and funded any startup that might be able to make it to the public markets quickly. Companies were funded with questionable markets, management teams, business models, and products.\n\nRegardless, venture investors often made good money on these short-term bets. Venture returns hit heights they had never seen, not even in the high-flying ’70s.\n\nMoney poured into venture at a rate that belied the 1980s warnings that the industry would need to shrink to prosper.\n\nAnd many more new funds were started to take the money.\n\nIn March 2000, some investors realized that some of the public Internet companies could not, under any reasonable growth and valuation assumptions, be worth what the market valued them at. They sold, and prices went down. Other investors, seeing prices go down, decided to cut their risk by also selling. Prices went down further. There was a brief rally and then investors lost their nerve. On March 27, 2000 the NASDAQ, where many of the Internet companies had listed their stock, closed at 4,959. By April 14, less than three weeks later, it had dropped more than 30%, to 3,321. The NASDAQ lost half its value by the end of the year. It has never, even after almost 15 years, returned to the highs of March 2000.\n\nThe ’90s were a bubble. Investors bought stocks because they could sell into a rising market. VCs backed companies because they could take them public. Everyone took brash product and market risks because the public markets did not care about these sorts of risks. But the ’80s were not a bubble. Not every cycle is a bubble.\n\nIf the fatal flaw of the ’90s was hubris–“This time it’s different”–the fatal flaw of the ’80s was fear. Venture capitalists were afraid to take risks. Instead they invested in known markets, less ambitious entrepreneurs, and later-stage companies. But you can’t get great returns without taking big risks: risk and reward are correlated. In the ’90s entrepreneurs and investors took huge risks and got big returns. In the ’80s they tried to avoid risk and got nothing.\n\nA couple of weeks ago the New York Times said:\n\nThe economics of starting companies, and investing in them, has changed over the last 15 years, said Andy Rachleff, a founder of Benchmark Capital…Before the ascendancy of the Internet, he said, venture capitalists invested in areas that had high technical risk and low market risk. It took a lot of capital to get these companies off the ground, but the odds that the company would succeed were relatively high if the company could deliver on its technology promise. “Today,” he said, “it’s the opposite.”\n\nFor that reason, many of the larger, more established venture funds are investing later, writing larger checks after concepts have proved themselves. These firms, which include Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark and Sequoia Capital, still account for the majority of all venture capital dollars. (New York Times, Venture Capital Is Looking for Ways to Outrun the Herd , 12/10/2014.)\n\nRisk is uncertainty about the future. High technical risk means not knowing if a technology will work. High market risk means not knowing if there will be a market for your product. These are the primary risks that the VC industry as a whole contemplates. (There are other risks extrinsic to individual companies, like regulatory risk, but these are less frequent.)\n\nEach type of risk has a different effect on VC returns. Technical risk is horrible for returns, so VCs do not take technical risk. There are a handful of examples of high technical risk companies that had great returns—Genentech. 43 , for example—but they are few 44 Today, VCs wait until there is a working prototype before they fund, but successful VCs have always waited until the technical risk was mitigated. Apple Computer, for example, did not have technical risk: the technology worked before the company was funded.\n\nMarket risk, on the other hand, is directly correlated to VC returns. When Apple was funded no one had any way of knowing how many people would buy a personal computer; the ultimate size of the market was analytically unknowable. DEC, Intel, Google, etc. all went into markets that they helped create. High market risk is associated with the best VC investments of all time. In the late ’70s/early ’80s and again in the mid to late ’90s VCs were comfortable funding companies with mind-boggling market risk, and they got amazing returns in exchange. In the mid to late ’80s they were scared and funded companies with low market risk instead, and returns were horrible.\n\nToday is like the 1980s. There are a plethora of me-too companies, companies with a new angle on a well-understood market, and companies founded with the hopes of being acquired before they need to bring on many customers. VCs are insisting on market validation before investing, and are putting money into sectors that have already seen big exits (a sign of a market that has already emerged.)\n\nSaying VCs used to take high technical risk and now take high market risk is both an overly optimistic view of the past—the mythical golden age of heroic VCs championing the development of new technologies—and an overly optimistic view of the present—gutsy VCs funding radical innovations that create entirely new markets. Neither of these things is true. VCs have never funded technical risk and they are not now funding market risk. 45 The VC community is purposely avoiding risk because we think we can make good returns without taking it. The lesson of the 1980s is that no matter how appealing this fantasy is, it’s still a fantasy.\n\nPeople in the VC industry talk about the ’60s, when institutional venture capital took off. They talk about the ’70s, when iconic companies like Apple and Genentech were founded and the microcomputer industry emerged. They talk about the ’90s and the Internet bubble. They don’t talk about the ’80s; the ’80s are the missing piece of the puzzle. You can have lots of plausible theories about what venture capitalists as a class can do to get good returns, until you take the 1980s into account. Then you can only have one: the only thing VCs can control that will improve their outcomes is having enough guts to bet on markets that don’t yet exist. Everything else is noise.\n\nThe 1990s are not our map, the 1980s are. Don’t worry about irrational exuberance fueling a bubble, that is not what is happening. Worry about fear of risk. We know where that leads: once again straight into the ditch.\n\n– Thanks to Justin Singer for reading drafts of this and helping me think it through.\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new

Governance — Mirror","link":"https://baby.mirror.xyz/O7a922A-9zT4C4UwssRExkftdHywJ-13sR2rxQ-t__k","content":"Decentralized governance has been dreamed of and experimented with for a long time. From self-managed market socialism in Yugoslavia to revolutionary anarchists in Spain to the IETF’s use of rough consensus , plenty of people have sought new and better ways to make bottom-up decisions.\n\nBut doing so at scale has never been easy. It is fiendishly difficult to get lots of people to make decisions and work together both non-hierarchically and effectively. Because blockchain technology enables decentralized consensus at scale, the implications for human decision-making and coordination are immensely promising; if we can use it to scale decentralized governance, this could be a paradigm shift in how most of us live and work together.\n\nIt’s not decentralization itself that is unlocking new possibilities for governance and other areas – it’s decentralized computation. Let’s take decentralization as a constraint here; in certain contexts, we want to avoid having centralized power and few points of failure. Computation is that which makes it possible to do what we want while respecting the constraint of decentralization.\n\nSmart contracts on Turing-Complete chains contain the promise of composable, arbitrarily programmable governance – what I call Turing-Complete governance.\n\nArbitrary programmability comes from the fact that blockchains like Ethereum are Turing-Complete computers, which can run algorithms to perform any well-defined computational tasks. If you create smart contracts to help organize people to do something together as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), you can specify any series of steps to determine how to do things like grant membership, allocate decision-making power, allocate created value, or aggregate member input to produce an output.\n\nComposability comes from the fact that Ethereum is also a world computer with interoperable programs (for more on why this is important, scroll to the appendix). This allows anyone to build upon existing contracts easily and reliably, to create something new and in turn, to share their creation with the world.\n\nTuring-Complete governance entails an arbitrarily vast and interconnected design space in which we can find better ways of encoding our organizational wants and needs. Hence, DAOs are routes to experiments in human organization and politics; a way for organizations to quickly experiment with decision-making, ownership and coordination structures that work for them.\n\nThe procedures we have in society for coordinating people to make a decision together are limited by our tools, and by what we can understand, verify and calculate. While it is undesirable (and impossible) to attempt to fully specify the soup of human desires and values in code, there are things that computers do better than humans do—even simple things—and we would do well to enable a symbiotic partnership between human and machine.\n\nToday, collective action problems abound . Misaligned incentives between the individual and the group prevent us from making progress on anything from pollution, to pandemics, to building alliances and working towards the same mission.\n\nHumanity has found a few ways to coordinate with each other to solve these issues. One classic coordination mechanism that humanity has found is the market. It’s arguably the most efficient one that we’ve made work somewhat-well at the scale and complexity of contemporary human society. (Many caveats here.)\n\nBut markets don’t just appear naturally – they take lots of work . They’re also often simply unsuitable for coordination, particularly when people need to make conscious decisions together rather than simply participating in transactions. In many domains, organizations work better than markets. In those cases, coordination usually occurs via the imposition of bureaucratic and hierarchical layers; the bigger the organization, the more layers. The role of managers, for example, is a coordination mechanism to ensure people are broadly aligned and doing what they’re supposed to .\n\nBlockchain-enforced execution of agreed contracts using consensus and transparency can, in numerous cases, reduce the need for the bureaucratic and hierarchical layers—the slow processes of legal and social recourse—that usually exist to coordinate humans to make decisions together.\n\nBut properties like decentralization and guaranteed execution are not enough to combat coordination problems. Decentralize what? Guaranteed execution of what? Despite our compelling goals and powerful processing tools, our knowledge of what organizational structures we want to create and the corresponding tooling to enact it is quite rudimentary. We should use our tools, in particular the composability and programmability of Turing-Complete blockchains, to deliberately experiment with and enact better methods of human organizing. If we can build up that empirical knowledge, we could address humanity’s biggest Achilles heel.\n\nSince Ethereum’s inception, the concept of on-chain DAOs has captured all sorts of interest. DAOs are often compared to internet-native businesses , or—the code-centric view— mostly-autonomous agents that require some degree of human support. The term is rather fuzzy, but whatever you believe a DAO is, it always involves multiple humans, whose association and activities are determined to some extent by smart contract code.\n\nWhile there are all sorts of reasons for creating a DAO—e.g. they can be purely social (e.g. gating access to an exclusive community based on a token), or necessitated based on a low-trust adversarial environment—to view DAOs as defined decision-making communities opens up their conceptual potential as powerful instruments for enabling better governance.\n\nGovernance is defined by Wikipedia as “the decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions… the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.” Let’s break this down into three components. Governance inherently involves a community coordinating to make decisions of consequence, and is formalized or defined in some way - it can’t just be a group of friends deciding where to go for drinks.\n\nViewing DAOs as decision-making communities is equivalent to seeing them as vehicles for governance. This view naturally brings up the questions of, what decisions are made, who makes them, and how are they made? Quickly, one will realize that almost all somewhat-formalized human activities involve making and executing decisions, so the scope of governance varies widely. As such, the scope and implementation of a DAO can and should also vary widely.\n\nOn the more simple side, you can have a DAO be a multi-signature wallet like PleasrDAO , where a certain proportion of signatures are required to take actions. More complex implementations generally involve a series of smart contracts that specify how ownership is allocated, what governance decisions are made, and what the decision-making process looks like—such as MakerDAO , which makes use of a complex system of interrelated smart contracts for governance.\n\nAt the moment, the usual structure of a DAO is an organization whose on-chain protocol involves using a token that allows the holder to vote on governance decisions. Usually, 1 token = 1 vote. This token-centric method of governance bundles ownership and governance rights in that one asset, in a bid to align power and responsibility.\n\nThe pure form of token-gated governance involves some downsides. Token ownership has the advantage of being an easy-to-understand model which allows for permissionless ownership by enabling community inclusion and decision-making power to be traded. Tokens can also, as has been pointed out , covertly sneak cooperative principles into “highly financialized spaces” by awarding governance power automatically to holders.\n\nHowever, token ownership also keeps out those who may be affected but don’t have the capital for buying tokens—a paradigm that becomes increasingly unjust as decisions made become increasingly consequential. It also creates opportunities for vote buying through unbundling economic interest and governance power, where those who are not personally invested in the community can borrow governance power through financial markets in these tokens. There’s also the question of those who are uninterested in governance power, and purely want to make money through the community, which can end up corrupting and over-financializing the spirit of the community, or even result in a hostile takeover . Auctioning off or loaning away voting power to those uninvested in quality governance, or want to steer governance towards selfish ends misaligned with the community, is generally a terrible idea.\n\nThe popularity of token governance is influenced by the current finance-first crypto culture. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the most popular application of smart contracts, because it’s easy to do it fully on-chain – you simply move numbers around on the blockchain. The most financially valuable and visible ones are built around DeFi protocols; just take a look at this dashboard of the most valuable DAOs. Token-based structures meet DeFi needs by allowing scalable ownership in low-trust contexts in which financial motives play a key role, and community over-financialization is low on the list of concerns. And even in those canonical DeFi spaces, there are still many organizational kinks to iron out , e.g. a lack of truly participatory decision-making.\n\nIn general, governance power should be given to those who are truly invested in making good governance decisions and contributing to the community in the long term.\n\nThe financialization of decision-making communities often rubs up directly against values like egalitarianism, inclusiveness or justice, forcing undesirable tradeoffs. It also prevents progress on decision-making around things that cannot or should not be monetized, including public goods like water, the internet, roads and libraries, or basic rights like clean air and education. Creating crypto-enabled decision-making communities around any of these things will require us not to take current implementations as given and examine our assumptions, e.g. transforming how we view and use tokens as digital rather than financial objects.\n\nThere’s a wave of excitement about DAOs; new ones springing up are opportunities to experiment and play with decision-making structures at lower stakes with freedom, earnestness and intention, so that communities can find better, more values-aligned ways to make the higher-stakes decisions.\n\nYou moved house two months ago, and have been parking on a side street close to your workplace during the day. You’ve been using your crypto wallet to pay for parking, and because your wallet address has been interacting with the parking spots in this area multiple times for months, you were granted a non-transferable governance token by the local council DAO, to participate in local decision-making. This token stays in your wallet as long as you’re still regularly parking there. You can also obtain this token by using your wallet to pay for public transit, where your route begins or ends in the area. Those that pay business taxes in the area get slightly different tokens, too.\n\nBefore it was easy to distribute participation, it was just the business owners who got invites to these forums. Now, rather than paying lip-service to the idea that they value the opinions of all those who come through the area, the council can find a clean, easy way to enact this, without creating complicated registration forms and braving the hurdles of outreach and discoverability—by dropping non-transferable tokens to various addresses that have activity in the area.\n\nYou’re sent an invite link to the forum, and to semi-regular meetings. Twice a year you get automagically pinged with a ballot listing a number of decisions on topics including parking standards, busking rules, permits, bike lanes, revenue allocation, waste collection days, and unusual one-off choices like under what conditions we let film crews close a certain street temporarily for shooting a movie scene, and how locals should be compensated for the disruption. While voting records are protected with zero-knowledge proofs , decision outcomes and consensus statements are transparently recorded, so if you find a new construction site across the street, you know exactly why they’re there, and how long they’ll be blocking traffic and making noise for. You also get pinged with quarterly polls on things like community safety and whether there is enough bicycle parking in the area. In earlier years, overwhelming decision-making friction meant that these decisions were largely all made by the larger city council, which standardized guidelines around parking, rates and road maintenance, at a granularity too coarse to be effective .\n\nIn earlier years, DAOs were primarily means of decentralizing ownership, but achieving the decentralized decision-making to go alongside it was very difficult. There was too much noise in forums, people had too little time to build context on decisions, and so on. In practice, decisions tended to come from the top down, and DAOs found it hard to scale to accommodate diverse input. Now, innovations in community governance tooling and “ organization legos ” have made sorting and prioritizing proposals much more streamlined, and thus much less centralized. Modular, composable mechanisms for submitting and reviewing proposals have proliferated, such that the most important ones get the most attention. This large council DAO has, through experimentation, come to rely on a proposal prioritization algorithm, which enables members to have personalized proposal feeds that still allow data control and privacy.\n\nYou find the parking signage extremely confusing, and one day you submit a proposal to spend money to standardize and clean up unnecessary clutter and difficult-to-interpret signage. Turns out that there are plenty of interface designers living in the area, who have been recommended your proposal by the algorithm. One of them has been wanting to switch to urban design; they are able to tag on to the proposal, and are eventually contracted for a few months to redesign the public signage in the area. Would they have known about this opportunity to contribute if not for the fact that your participation in local affairs, as well as their ability to see relevant information, was made relatively frictionless, and yet with decentralized and privacy-preserving properties?\n\nAfter a few months, some members want to start a local credit union, to help the community with better interest rates and fees. Because of interoperability, they’re able to immediately take the existing member list of the local council DAO (plus that of the local library DAO, and the community arts center DAO), and stitch together a preliminary reputational system based off the existing data contained in those DAOs, to bootstrap a credit system (through which financial privacy is protected using zkSNARKs ). Interoperability allows them to avert the cold-start problem .\n\nJane Jacobs speaks of the importance of lively sidewalks to a city, where many people of all backgrounds mingle, keep a casual eye out for each other, and can meet naturally in public. Much of this, she insists, must be informal, to keep private life from being transgressed on by institutional structures. Interoperability and programmability means that we have an opportunity to stitch together human structures that look very different to past ones—informal, lively, casual yet strong.\n\nPublic infrastructure on the Internet should be like public infrastructure in the physical world: in the ideal case, freely accessible and used by many. We shouldn’t settle for an online landscape of gated silos, difficult-to-use UIs, and huge barriers to participation. Crypto doesn’t solve all these problems (in fact, it can feel like an abnormally difficult space to navigate), but properties like interoperability and decentralization can help us find ways of bringing together loosely-connected people. Cryptographic security can help people who have no prior reason of trusting each other, to come together to plant an initial seed of confidence, a seed which is now allowed an opportunity to grow and become real, non-digital trust. What can our powerful processing tools do for reshaping what a digital society looks like?\n\nThese are theoretically infinite possibilities in how you could configure your organization to address your needs. Here, I will break governance down into five configurable aspects:\n\n(Although, as I’ll get to later, there are design decisions and tradeoffs to be made here—in particular, we likely do not want to make all of these pieces highly algorithmically complex.)\n\nOne example of a complete DAO configuration is token based membership where 1 token = 1 vote, tying both membership (#1) and power (#2) to the number of tokens held in one’s wallet. A binary yes-no vote on a decision, with the majority of some quorum needed to pass the vote, serves to aggregate preferences (#3). Consensus is signalled through a UI that displays the vote tallies for each option (#4) and the value created is represented by the financial value of the governance token, which one hopes to increase (#5).\n\nThis is a pretty standard token-based governance model, but it is limited, as mentioned. But, as also (repeatedly) mentioned, Turing-Complete governance means that there are truly infinite possibilities.\n\nFor membership granting (#1), you can have people submit proposals that are endorsed by an existing member (e.g. MolochDAO does this). Or, a protocol can automatically grant membership to anyone who has interacted with it a certain number of times, determining who has a voice solely based on their history of participation. Airdrops work like this: protocols can automatically send governance tokens to early users, when a token is created for it. Airdrops are magical because few human organizations have ever been able to directly tie ownership to participation and early adoption so efficiently and cheaply. Before crypto, this would require extensive, deliberate personal information tracking and human outreach effort, far beyond simply sending tokens to a list of addresses. Imagine if we had airdrops for more decisions relevant to the off-chain world, like participating in local council (or being a regular at a community library, or listening to a radio station).\n\nPower allocation within the organization (#2) can also be implemented in many ways. Instead of allocating executive power via voting for specific proposals, an organization can grant roles to different addresses which can execute different capabilities. Imagine fair, decentralized jury duty in the local council DAO, where every month different addresses are randomly chosen to participate in a jury of peers, responsible for executing difficult and involved decisions e.g. major disputes between members. They can also add transparent conditions, such as, the jury participant needs to have been part of the organization for at least 100 days. When you are called to jury duty, you can trust in some degree of fairness and lack of corruption guaranteed by the code, which for some, might make the difference between whether they participate or not.\n\nDifferential amounts of power could be allocated by varying how many votes a member has. Power could be tied to a proxy for correctness or knowledge , derived from e.g. how information- or citation-dense your posts generally are, how “predictive” your voting pattern is of organizational behavior, and so on. It could also be tied to reputation. The magic of interoperability is that you could earn a greater say via increasing some reputation metric within the community, or improving your reputation elsewhere on the chain. If you participate in a number of DAOs, someone could create e.g. a modified PageRank algorithm that determines your reputation score by incorporating all of your on-chain activity. (This also has Sybil-resistant properties, since it’s hard to create multiple accounts all with good reputation.)\n\nPreference aggregation (#3) differs from power allocation in the sense that all members could be granted equal capabilities, but there are still many different ways one could aggregate many equals’ inputs to produce some decision. A quadratic voting , conviction voting or a futarchy algorithm can be used to make decisions. If you’re worried about the effects of doing something highly experimental and possibly community-damaging, you could program the smart contract to only implement this for a fixed trial period. You could also implement a voting system that chooses an outcome dependent on some external state: e.g. we vote to pass the decision for the DAO to donate $40k to a crisis hotline if our token value hits its all-time high in the next week. Everyone is thus transparently committed to the donation, making it easier to honour our commitments, and harder to renege on the promise out of laziness or sudden uncharitability.\n\nOne of the most interesting design decisions defining DAOs is the aggregation of member inputs to produce some output, whether for producing the final decision (#3) or for signalling consensus (#4). Usually, this involves vote aggregation: if the majority of members vote “Yes” on a proposal, the DAO code gathers up these votes and outputs a decision on whether the proposal will indeed be accepted or rejected. Imagine, however, a DAO that is tasked with recording and amending the canonical narrative of some subculture. It takes user proposals on sentences to change the on-chain story, and amends the story contract to evolve the story. Or, imagine a DAO that is an experiment in capturing people’s preferences in richer and more useful ways, which takes in people’s preferences as text input and amalgamates this to create a consensus document about what the group believes.\n\nPolis , for example, is an existing example of a system for gathering, analyzing and visualizing what large, diverse groups of people think in their own words; something like this could be used in the DAO decision-making process. If we have consensus statements from the DAO (or subgroups within it), this can become a rich iterative loop, with some of the statements being turned back into proposals to be fed back into the governance process for further improvements.\n\nSignalling consensus is an important function of a DAO; creating a record of what people want and signalling the common opinion, in as rich and useful a manner as possible, allows people both inside and outside the group to keep a pulse on the state and likely direction of the group sentiment, values, culture, nodes of power and ability to coordinate.\n\nLastly, created value can be allocated (#5) in various ways. There can be an explicit value loop with paying out dividends to members (e.g. dxdao does this), an implicit value loop enabled by token holding (e.g. MakerDAO and the MKR token, which should increase in value if people govern well), or allocating it to the broader community by vote, bounty, participation, or other metric; whatever one decides. Because a lot of the management is automated away using code, there will likely be more value to share among contributors—and not just direct contributors, but those further down the chain, outside the DAO, who you could program payment to as well. As Vitalik Buterin said, “Instead of putting the taxi driver out of a job, blockchain puts Uber out of a job and lets the taxi drivers work with the customer directly.” It’s an opportunity to rethink the usual value loops that we participate in.\n\nTuring-Completeness is a paradigm shift for governance, as it was for computers. Quite literally, anything is possible. One can build with composable models of decentralized community, orienting a community to financial stake, discourse, or anything else. And given that communities are dynamic, the efficiency and composability of code means people can more easily enact different models of governance as the shape and context of their community changes over time.\n\nAnd while I’ve proposed these five components of governance, they’re not the only parts of an organization that can or need to be designed (especially as our understanding of governance evolves). For example, one idiosyncratic property is a specification of when the DAO will end: e.g. programming a temporary task-force DAO to disband after the members reach their goal.\n\nThere’s so many mechanisms out there that haven’t yet been imagined. This article gestures at some implementations, but barely scrapes the surface of the possible. What is the equivalent of the Uniswap mechanism —a conceptually elegant, relatively simple mechanism that actually works—for DAOs? Are there implementations that can help us create spaces that are more inclusive, intuitive, and generative?\n\nBlockchain and interoperability don’t necessarily have to make everything easier. In fact, a lot of things are made difficult (or even impossible) by design, such as making a one-line code update or running large parallel-processing machine learning jobs. If one decides to use blockchain, they decide to accept its particular landscape of friction; when they program on top of that, they can likewise choose where to increase and decrease friction.\n\nWe might want to make the community resilient to exploitative bad actors in a decentralized way. One simple way of doing this is increasing friction for the use of executive power, by e.g. having a multi-sig wallet for key decisions, where you need a minimum amount of signatures to agree to a decision. You could add an extra layer of security by requiring e.g. a majority vote on a decision on top of the multi-sig condition. You can pile on even more layers of resilience if you so choose; and excitingly, these computational layers of resilience may turn out to look very different to the default hierarchical and bureaucratic layers of resilience built into our standard institutions. Computation allows for organizational processes with curious properties.\n\nAnother way of increasing resilience to bad actors is by decreasing friction for whistleblowing, e.g. interoperable programs that make anonymous whistleblowing more computationally secure. Imagine a potential whistleblower working for an on-chain decentralized company, who wants to speak up about another member’s bad behaviour or to anonymously leak politically sensitive documents. Using zero-knowledge proofs, this person could prove from an alt address that their main address is in a list of addresses that have been part of the company for years, without disclosing who they actually are. This gives their voice needed legitimacy, while preserving anonymity. For example, when it comes to the OpenSea insider trading scandal : imagine if someone at OpenSea got wind of some insider trading early on, and wanted to speak up about this to save the direction of the company and to oust the culprits without risking their own reputation. The incident may have course-corrected early on, and resulted in a smaller public outcry. The threat of anonymous whistleblowing may even have prevented such behaviour.\n\nWe might also want to decrease friction for those using alternative identities to gain DAO membership more generally, not just for whistleblowing. Inter-DAO and inter-address reputation mechanisms, and services built on zero-knowledge proofs (like TornadoCash) could increase participation from marginalized people, those who are or could be at political or social risk, and the 1 billion people worldwide without an official ID . All these people would ordinarily be locked out of regular human governance institutions, but now they can participate, especially if the DAO has a culture of building trust without necessarily requiring real names, something many people do on Twitter . This would increase the diversity of participants as a whole, letting in voices that we don’t even know we’ve been missing out on.\n\nIn DAO design, it’s important to consider the amount of complexity being introduced. We don’t want to make governance overly complicated, with fancy, inscrutable algorithms that many won’t trust or intuitively understand.\n\nTuring-Complete governance shouldn’t be advocated as a way to make the most complex algorithm possible. The point is that we can have any inputs we want, and any computational transformation of those inputs to produce some output. Vitalik has pointed out that simple social systems with more predictable outcomes and understandable processes for tweaking the outcome are more desirable; participants are more inclined to trust and rely on institutional processes. We should be looking for elegant, intuitive mechanisms, not complicated ones. And what “elegant” or “intuitive” means may surprise us, once we do more experimenting in this massive design space. The most empirically effective mechanisms may not be the solutions that seem theoretically immaculate.\n\nFurthermore, rather than using computation to make the space of outcomes overly large and risking overfitting to a particular situation, we could use it to create more complexity in the form of layers of safety and security, in order to increase the resilience of the organization (e.g. make interoperable layers for communities to guard against black swan events together, making it cheaper to prevent terrible, but low-probability events). In Vitalik’s words, optimizing for low VC dimension , but higher Kolmogorov complexity .\n\nThe higher the stakes and the more people depending on the system for more things, the less complicated an outcome space we want. At the same time, humans have a complex and long list of values to fulfill. How do we solve this? Rather than having each of our institutions become everything to everyone, it’s better to create many institutions that are limited in different ways such that as an ecosystem of institutions, they cover the span of what people need and want. Let’s make it far easier to increase the number of institutions (something that technology can help us with), but define each of them narrowly.\n\nOnce something is created, especially if it’s complicated and experimental, it’s important to study its human effects. We should pay close attention to how technology and people interact and co-evolve. How do participants respond to and integrate these mechanisms into their life? How do people modify, adapt, fork, learn in response to and in tandem with code?\n\nTechnical properties of governance are critical; they determine many of the freedoms and constraints of decision making, can help keep a community together, and to a large extent determine the character or quality of decisions made (or the fact of being able to make any decisions together at all!). But ultimately, our attempts at constructing better governance systems is in service of people, and the purposes and values that people define. DAOs can bring people together who never would have otherwise met, had a say in decision-making, or been able to share in the upside of good governance. A DAO succeeds if its technical properties grease the flywheel of decision-making, community building and participation, rather than staying the center of attention. A DAO also succeeds if its programmability allows the community to experiment with radical organizing structures and decision-making processes, and come away with valuable learnings. (Even if ultimately people decide that keeping everything or anything on-chain is unsuitable for them.)\n\nIn a very deep sense, everything is arbitrary, and everything is connected. Our agency is coupled with this arbitrariness. What do we choose when we can choose anything?\n\nIn this infinite design space, we are not forced to limit ourselves to one single paradigm. Rather, this is the opportunity to choose and explore many different things as an ecosystem of communities, and what’s more, to connect and compose our creations—and in a sense, ourselves—together.\n\nOur collective success and responsibility involves using our tools and coordination mechanisms to move towards the more fertile path — where win-win games are easier to find, where miscommunication reduces, and where we more deeply feel our interconnectedness.\n\nThank you to everyone who talked with me about these ideas, read or left comments on drafts of this essay, including but not limited to Justin Glibert, Toby Shorin, gubsheep, Scott Moore, Vivek Singh, Raymond Zhong, Andy Tudhope, Jasmine Wang, Nikhil Devraj, and riley wong. I’m very grateful for the opportunities this piece has provided to discuss, think and imagine with all of you. Additionally, thanks very much to 0xPARC for a learning grant that helped make this essay happen.\n\nIt’s worth expanding on the value of composability, which comes about because of blockchain interoperability. I’ll introduce the idea by comparing it with another common term in software: open source. While it is now relatively common as a hallmark of software openness to make something open source, enabling interoperability is less common, and less easy.\n\nThe distinction between the two is that for open source, the source code is freely available, whereas interoperability means that one application/system can exchange, integrate, access and use another application or system’s functionality and data. Things like common protocols, permissionlessness, and no or minimal system downtime increase interoperability.\n\nIn a way, open source is easy to operationalize. You simply release your source code. Interoperability, however, has to be built into the system, and exists by degrees. Just because you can see the source code of an app doesn’t mean you can use its data, communicate with it, or build on top of it. Usually developers have to spend significant effort building and maintaining APIs to facilitate interoperability.\n\nInteroperability is generally enabled by canonical protocols and standards for interface design and communication. While the underlying layer of the internet is fundamentally interoperable through e.g. TCP/IP, HTTPS, TLS and email protocols, most applications on top of it are not. This results in people becoming inescapably tied to platforms , unable to change clients or move their data, and the proliferation of bloated, monopolistic silos like Instagram and YouTube.\n\nImagine if every application on the Internet by default had a zero-downtime, publicly exposed API. You can message Discord accounts using WhatsApp, and watch videos hosted anywhere on a video client of your choice. Flexibility is the norm; silos are rare.\n\nSmart contracts are tremendously interoperable by default. They can not only programmatically interact with other smart contracts, the blockchain guarantees equal uptime, data availability and validity of all programs. It’s possible to use and compose existing primitives on top of each other to make potentially complex and tightly integrated systems, without fear that something further down the stack will fail. Anyone’s work can be highly interoperable without them putting significant effort into making it so.\n\nYou can also see the blockchain as a decentralized database and source of shared truth—you can read data to e.g. verify that some existing algorithm acts in an expected way, rather than just seeing the source code. This decentralized data availability adds extra guarantees.\n\nWe’ve made a decentralized world computer that we can easily build together on, with a database we can all use as shared reference.

are cheap, execution is everything.\n\nIt doesn’t matter how good the strategy is - it’s meaningless if it can’t be executed well.\n\nGreat execution is enforced by strong execution culture. But what does it really mean to have a strong execution culture?\n\nMarty Cagan , product management leader, and Partner at Silicon Valley Product Group outlines the 7 key principles:\n\nCulture of urgency – people feel like they are in war-time and that if they don’t find a way to move fast then bad things could happen\n\nCulture of high-integrity commitments – teams understand the need for (and power of) commitments, but they also insist on high-integrity commitments\n\nCulture of empowerment – teams feel like they have the tools, resources and the permission to do whatever is necessary to meet their commitments\n\nCulture of accountability – one way or another people and teams feel a deep responsibility to meet their commitments; accountability also implies consequences – not necessarily being terminated except in extreme and repeated situations – more likely consequences to their reputations among their peers\n\nCulture of collaboration – while team autonomy and empowerment is important, teams understand their even higher need to work together to accomplish many of the biggest and most meaningful objectives\n\nCulture of results – is the focus on output or is the focus on results?\n\nCulture of recognition – teams often take their cues from what is rewarded and what is accepted. Is it just the team that comes up with the great new idea that gets rewarded, or the team that delivered on a brutally tough commitment? And what is the message if missing a commitment is seen as easily excusable?\n\nSimplify put – as a leader, you should:\n\nEncourage your team to take action with urgency – and to focus on impact rather than inputs or outputs\n\nFoster an environment of teamwork, collaboration, and recognition\n\nEnable your team by providing the proper tools, resources, and guidance they need to succeed\n\n(Partner post) Check out one of my favorite newsletters… YouTopian Journey provides weekly motivation and wisdom to help you become mentally stronger and realize your potential.\n\nYou have greatness within!

Take Action for the SDGs\n\nWe are helping platform companies improve working standards in the gig economy\n\nRead more about this project\n\nMuch work has been done to close gaps in gender and race equality in the tech industry, but a new report indicates there’s still more needed.\n\nCareers website Dice’s Equality In Tech report asked more than 9,000 technologists about their overall career satisfaction and concluded more must be done to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nHere’s how gender and race impacted those working in the tech industry.\n\nGender discrimination in the workplace\n\nThese statistics show that women experience gender discrimination significantly more than men in the workplace.\n\nWhen asked if they had experienced gender discrimination in the tech industry, 57% of women respondents said they had, compared to only 10% of men.\n\nNearly half (48%) of women also reported seeing discrimination in terms of their technical abilities – double that of men.\n\nRacial discrimination in the workplace\n\nRacial and gender discrimination is an ongoing issue in workplaces.\n\nDice also asked about experiencing racial discrimination in the tech sector and found Black respondents were most likely to have seen it than all other groups, at 48%.\n\nThis was followed by Hispanic/Latino(a) respondents at 30%, Asian/Pacific Islanders at 25%, Asian Indian respondents at 23% and White respondents at 9%.\n\nGender pay gap\n\nWomen are less likely to negotiate their salary at a new job than men.\n\nThe Equality in Tech report also found that more women (35%) were dissatisfied with their current compensation compared to their male colleagues (29%).\n\nHowever, women were also less likely to have actively negotiated their salary at their most recent new job – with 44% of women saying they had compared to 49% of men.\n\nRacial pay gap\n\nThese statistics show that compensation satisfaction varies across different races.\n\nPay inequality has been a long-running issue in the tech industry and it is still impacting how employees from various backgrounds feel about their salary.\n\nWhile six in 10 White respondents said they were satisfied with their salary, just half of Black technologists felt similarly, along with 49% of both Hispanic/Latino(a) and Asian/Pacific Islander respondents and 45% of Asian Indian participants.\n\nSatisfaction with career by gender\n\nThese statistics show that women are less satisfied with their career in the tech industry than men.\n\nWomen in the tech industry were also found to be less satisfied with their overall career than their male peers – with a total of 63% saying they were very or somewhat satisfied, compared to 68% of men.\n\nSatisfaction with career by ethnicity\n\nThis graph shows that race affects career satisfaction in the tech industry.\n\nWhite employees working in the tech industry were found to be significantly more satisfied with their careers (at 69%) compared to their Hispanic/Latino(a) (66%), Black (61%), Asian/Pacific Islander (61%) and Asian Indian (58%) colleagues.\n\nBurnout experience by gender\n\nWomen and men experience a similar level of burn-out in the tech industry.\n\nWomen technologists (32%) were more likely to report higher levels of burnout than men (30%), with workload and hours worked the biggest contributory factor for both. However, women were more likely to suffer due to overall COVID-19 stress – with 20% reporting pandemic stress opposed to 15% of men.\n\nBurnout experience by ethnicity\n\nThis is the relationship between burn-out and race in the tech industry.\n\nAbout a third of all those in the tech industry feel burned out, regardless of ethnicity. Those with a Hispanic/Latino(a) or Asian Indian background reported the highest levels of burnout at 33%, followed by White (31%), Asian/Pacific Islander (30%) and then Black (25%). Hispanic/Latino(a) technologists reported significantly higher pandemic stress, at 23%, than peers.\n\nMaking the tech industry more inclusive\n\nWhile acknowledging efforts by the tech industry to improve gender and racial diversity, equality and inclusion in the workplace, Dice concludes more needs to be done.\n\nIn terms of gender, the report emphasizes the importance of allyship to the success of organizational schemes focused on diversity, equity and inclusion, adding that allies with privilege and power – regardless of level – can help women advocate for their needs.\n\nWhen it comes to racial equality, the report says managers need to do all they can to build an inclusive and supportive culture – including advocating for new hiring and retention policies – to build and support a diverse workplace culture.\n\nWhat's the World Economic Forum doing about diversity, equity and inclusion?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and recent social and political unrest have created a profound sense of urgency for companies to actively work to tackle inequity.\n\nThe Forum's work on Diversity, Equality, Inclusion and Social Justice is driven by the New Economy and Society Platform, which is focused on building prosperous, inclusive and just economies and societies. In addition to its work on economic growth, revival and transformation, work, wages and job creation, and education, skills and learning, the Platform takes an integrated and holistic approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice, and aims to tackle exclusion, bias and discrimination related to race, gender, ability, sexual orientation and all other forms of human diversity.\n\nEquality in jobs of tomorrow\n\nDice’s findings for the tech industry have particular relevance as 84% of employers plan to accelerate their digitization agenda and 50% intend to speed up the automation of tasks .\n\nThe World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2021 warns that there are significant challenges for the future of gender parity in emerging jobs in this new world of work. For example, female representation remains under 25% in roles such as artificial intelligence specialist, cloud engineer and DevOps manager.\n\nMeasures such as making a longer shortlist when recruiting, using skills-based assessments and making work-life balance a priority can help address this imbalance and improve diversity in the workplace.\n\nThe World Economic Forum has also published a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 4.0 toolkit for employers, with research suggesting that well-managed diverse teams significantly outperform homogenous ones – on everything from innovation to profitability and employee engagement.\n\nUpLink - Take Action for the SDGs\n\nA weekly update of what’s on the Global Agenda\n\nA study has shown that working from home can actually make things worse for women and slow their career progression - especially those in white-collar jobs.\n\nThere are still fewer women than men in work or looking for work in most countries, and rates in some places are going backwards.

Read it here .\n\nThis is part of an ongoing series of deep dives on coliving spaces. To see others, visit the Supernuclear directory .\n\nSomeone called them the “Shoulder Years” — let’s say roughly late 20s until mid 30s.\n\nIt’s the years when your friends are all over the map. Some of them are newly single, out of their early 20s relationships, and hitting the dating apps with a vengeance. Some are newly married and thinking about what life together means. Others are popping out their second kid and tending to a whole different set of life issues.\n\nRadish was conceived during the shoulder years. It’s a place designed to house the far-ranging life circumstances of the friends we held dear and wanted to live near.\n\nThe rallying cry for Radish was what we called “ The Obvious Truth ”\n\nWe call it the Obvious Truth because it’s a “no shit, Socrates” kind of insight... it’s pretty obvious. The hard part is actually designing your life around this truth when our built environment caters almost exclusively to either nuclear families or living alone. Radish was designed to optimize for this Obvious Truth rather than settle for the norm.\n\nRadish was Kristen and my second coliving community after RGB . In designing Radish, we were optimizing for the following:\n\nFlexible co-ownership for residents + non-residents : We wanted people to be able to own pieces of the project at different amounts and allow non-resident supporters to buy in as well.\n\nAccommodating people in different life stages : We want a space that works for single people, couples, and also young families with a toddler or two. We wanted both standalone apartment units that could provide for more privacy (at higher cost) and bedrooms in a house that were less private (at lower cost).\n\n1+1=9 : Since we were pooling our resources, we wanted to live in a much nicer space than any of us could afford individually. We wanted a large yard and room for building a dedicated community building.\n\nWalking distance to transit (BART) : No one is living off the land here. Everyone needs a way to get to work. Commuting sucks and we were not willing to subject our favorite people to a grinding daily commute. This was an urban project.\n\nThe search for property took two years. We saw dozens of properties, seriously evaluated about 10, and put in 3 offers.\n\nEvery day we looked at our daily listing email alerts from Zillow, Trulia, and LoopNet to see if our dream property had appeared on market yet. We reviewed every listing of \u003e4000sqft of building and \u003e8000sqft of land in our target zip codes for over a year to get a feel for the market. We even coded an algorithm that scraped listing sites for properties being sold next to each other at the same time.\n\nThen the unicorn appeared. A property that was sufficiently unusual that a “normal” developer wouldn’t know what to do with it, but perfect for our coliving purposes.\n\nIt was a single 1/3 acre parcel with two buildings — a 4-plex of apartments and a 5br single family home. It was a short walk from a well-located BART train station in Oakland.\n\nThere was space in the middle to construct a third building and an empty overgrown yard that was screaming for a big garden.\n\nIt was as close to perfect as we were going to find. So we put in a bid and then immediately got to work pooling resources to buy it (more on that below…).\n\nFive “founding residents” moved in — all close friends of Kristen and mine to start. For a project of this complexity, we wanted to start with people we knew well and trusted and then planned to grow from there. Four more people followed over the next few months — some who we knew before and others who just liked the vision.\n\nWe inaugurated the space with the Sledgehammer Gala — taking down an unneeded wall in formal attire.\n\nThe first year was “The Great Build” — turning a property that wasn’t designed for coliving into one that was built for our needs.\n\nStep 1, obviously, was installing the hot tub in the big empty yard. Priorities, people!\n\nNext we renovated some of the apartments, built a fire pit, a couple storage sheds, landscaped the property, and most importantly built our standalone communal space — The Blueberry. The group made hundreds of design decisions … from what color mulch to buy, what type of tile should go in the bathroom, and the dishwasher most likely to withstand daily use by a dozen people.\n\nDesign by committee was no one’s idea of fun, so we worked in pairs. Two people worked each piece of the project together. They got input where helpful, but we didn’t sit in long meetings debating the virtues of granite vs quartz countertops. We placed trust in the design team.\n\n2/3 of the overall project cost was purchasing the property. 1/3 was the Great Build projects and renovations. It was a nice balance between “ready to live in” and “room for the imagination.”\n\nSet rents so that owners make target returns (no more, no less)\n\nOur first principle is transparency. And this post is written in that spirit. We are 100% transparent about every dime spent and earned with the community. Trust is critical in community and opaque financial processes can erode trust.\n\nWe divided the world into two entities: The landlord entity (Big Cabbage LLC) and the community entity (Radish Community).\n\nBig Cabbage LLC owns the property. It does all the normal landlord-y things like maintaining the property, holding insurance, and paying property tax. It firmly exists in the world of capitalism. It has shareholders, it produces a profit \u0026 loss statement every quarter, it has legal agreements, etc. A bank would look at Big Cabbage LLC and say “cool, I get it.”\n\nThe Radish Community (aka the current residents) govern how people live on the property. Radish Community is essentially the master tenant renting the property from Big Cabbage LLC. It does all the unconventional community things. It is fluid and self-governed. It firmly exists in the world of the communal. It decides how our food plan works, how we recruit new community members, and how rent is split between residents.\n\nWe think of Big Cabbage LLC as existing to serve the Radish Community, present and future. It needs to produce enough income to attract investors to put money into the project, but its primary goal is to steward a long-term healthy community rather than maximize profit.\n\nAlthough these two entities are structurally and legally distinct, there is overlap in who participates in each.\n\nWe set it up this way to achieve a few objectives:\n\nWe wanted non-residents to be able to buy in. We had friends that wanted to own a small part of Bay Area real estate and were big supporters of the idea but they weren’t ready to live there.\n\nOur friends have different means and we wanted people to be able to invest at whatever level they are comfortable. We didn’t want to obligate anyone to invest either. Residents can choose to invest or not invest and the amounts can vary based on means.\n\nWe wanted people to be able to move around the property easily. If you are simply renting your space, this is simple. You move spaces and pay a different rent. If you own your physical space, this is harder.\n\nThe purchase of the property (⅔ of total project cost) was funded by a small initial group of people along with debt from a bank. Kristen and I have the loan under our personal names and we are responsible for the payments on it. Our shareholding in the LLC accounts for this.\n\nThe renovations and construction (⅓ of total project cost) was funded by later investors and also by the bank (it’s a construction loan).\n\nThere are two ways investors can sell shares: 1) Selling to an incoming investor (e.g. a new resident who moves in) 2) When we sell the property.\n\nUnlike other communities that intend to operate in perpetuity, Radish is designed as a 5–10 year venture. It’s the place that makes sense for us now in this life stage. And the financial and governance structure reflects this. Having an expectation for an exit allowed us to easier attract investors. Our friends and residents would have been reticent to put in money that had no timeline for return.\n\nAs new residents come in and want to invest, we can use this capital to buy out some older investors. We do an appraisal every ~2 years to guide pricing for those transactions.\n\nThis means in effect there is no guaranteed liquidity. You can’t say “I want to sell” one day and be guaranteed a buyer. Opportunities to sell do appear but they are irregular.\n\nThis impacts who we allow to invest. We are very careful not to allow people to invest with money they might need back soon. We only wanted people’s discretionary capital, not their nest eggs. And given that no one is putting i their nest eggs, there is typically less urgency to get their money back. All the resident-investors who left the community so far have chosen to leave their money in.\n\nThe investment is more like a 5–10 year bond. It produces dividends every year (target: 5%) and eventually will return the original capital when we sell the property or when a new investor wants to buy in. And the investors split any of the appreciation (or depreciation) on sale.\n\nPrinciple #5: Set rents so that owners make target returns (no more, no less)\n\nWhen residents are owners in different proportions, you need to figure out a fair way to set rent. There’s a natural tension where the people who are relatively more “owners” will want rent to be higher and the people who are relatively more “renters” will be rent to be lower.\n\nWe solve this via a simple method: We set a target rate of return for investors. We chose 5% as our target return meaning that investors should receive 5% of their invested capital back every year in the form of a dividend. This is a typical (not too high, not to low) rate of return on new real estate investments in the Bay Area.\n\nSo we estimated expenses and set overall rents accordingly. And if expenses are lower than anticipated, we can lower rents to hit that 5% target. It allows us to be transparent with incoming residents on why rents are the way they are.\n\nThe Radish Community decides how the rents get divided internally between the individual residents. They can choose to subsidize rooms to make something more affordable for someone who can’t afford ‘market’ rent. Or they can choose to leave rooms vacant. Like a normal landlord, Big Cabbage LLC just expects to get a fixed amount each month and doesn’t need to get involved in the details.\n\nEach month, the Radish Community collects dues to pay for community expenses. Here’s what a typical month looks like:\n\nNote on “repayment of setup costs:” Big Cabbage LLC loaned the community money to get started with some upfront expenses … like kitchenware and gets paid back with 0% interest over three years.\n\nBig Cabbage LLC is a benevolent dictatorship. Kristen and I are the managers of the LLC. The LLC makes big capital decisions like “when do we sell the property?” and “should we build a new building”\n\nThe Radish Community makes most of the day-to-day decisions that impact residents. It has a few layers of governance.\n\nAny decisions that are reversible or small happen do-ocratically. If you want to paint a wall, just do it. If you want to buy a shoe rack, just do it.\n\nSome larger decisions (e.g. spend \u003e $50) happen by “The Senate” — a system where people vote in a Slack Channel. We’ll do a future post on this idea.\n\nDecisions on new community members and changes to dues are done by consensus. We consider these to be the most impactful decisions and everyone must affirmatively agree.\n\nFood is a big part of the Radish culture. Shared meals are frequent. We believe food is a cheat code for community and we want to have it in abundant supply.\n\nA Slack channel called “Make it Appear” personifies this. There’s a group of staples that always gets ordered. Anything else you want, you request it in #makeitappear and soon it appears by the magic of a bulk food order. On person shops on behalf of the whole group.\n\nInterested in living at the Radish when we have openings in the future?\n\nLet us know here .\n\nCurious about coliving?

Not in the sense that I did anything to upset him, but because it felt like he was always assessing everything around him to see if it conformed to his standard of good taste. What you worked on, what you read, whom you were friends with, whom you dated, what you tweeted about, etc were all up for scrutiny, and it wasn’t particularly nice scrutiny. Let’s not even get into what he thinks of “self-help.” I don’t want to condemn his perspective (I’m definitely more critical than I’d like to be), but I wanted to distance myself from it, because I’ve been trying very hard to focus on this idea of “running your own race.”\n\nRun your own race, as in: you set certain standards for yourself, and you focus on meeting them. When you meet them, you’re proud of yourself. When you don’t, you urge yourself to try harder. You don’t question your standards based on what anyone else is doing. You don’t look over at someone else’s race and think, I’m doing a bad job because you’re going faster. You just focus on your own pace.\n\nI know this sounds very goal-oriented, but it’s actually been helpful to me in every area of my life. On the creative level, I’m revising some writing right now, and my only goal is to hit a certain word count every day. That’s it. If I’m feeling good, I go over it, but my job is not to go under it. I don’t worry too much about whether the writing is going anywhere (existentially, lol), what anyone else is writing, or if I’m writing fast enough—I just keep going. On a personal level, it’s been even more helpful. I have a friend whose communication style I really admire: she’s clear, emotionally honest, and sets great boundaries. My hope is to be like that in every important emotional encounter: to express my needs clearly, to be as honest as possible, and to make it clear what’s okay and what isn’t. This is incredibly freeing, because it means I judge myself by my own standard of behavior in every relationship, and not by the other person’s response. I’ve noticed that most people seem to overly fixate on other people’s responses: i.e. my partner is upset at me, so I must have been a bad girlfriend. She didn’t want to go on another date, so I must have been super boring and said the wrong thing. I had a fight with my friend and they’ve been ignoring me since, so I must have overestimated our intimacy. Like, hey, maybe you were super boring and maybe you did overreach, but if you want to calibrate accurately, you have to center your own behavior. How did you act? If you have no way to judge that’s not based on obsessively analyzing other people’s micro-reactions to you, you probably don’t know who you are in the absence of someone else’s verdict.\n\nIf you’re forever looking around for validation, you’ll never be able to make anything that’s completely your own. Because you don’t even know what you think. You don’t know what is good and beautiful outside of what is culturally dictated to be good and beautiful. We believe that desire is mimetic, but we forget that the people who inspire real desire are always people who are redefining it—who give us something new to look at, allow us to escape groupthink. There’s nothing more powerful than separating signal from noise, spotting a phenomenon no one else has recognized yet. But to do that you need your own separate thoughts.\n\nSo: cultivate your independence. Run your own race, knowing that the destination is yours to choose. Don’t enslave yourself to people who think there’s only one way to be right. Your job is to do what you like on your own terms. Your job is to keep going, to eke out good day after good day.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

We will all one day have to mourn the death of a loved one, and others will do the same for us. But what happens when the person we are mourning is still very much alive—perhaps even still in our lives?\n\nI think about this type of grief a lot. This emotion is far from foreign to me, and as I grow older, I’m realizing that more and more people have experienced it or are currently going through it as well. (I am once again reminded here that we are not alone in these experiences, finding both sadness and comfort in this realization.)\n\nOn the lighter end, you could feel some amount of grief when you and a close friend drift apart over time, becoming strangers with a history. You might also experience this type of grief for your past or future self, but this topic requires an entirely separate post.\n\nOn the more extreme end—and this is the type of grief I want to talk about in this piece—it could happen when a loved one undergoes a significant negative change that transforms who they are as a person, or you find out something about them that entirely changes how you see them, leaving you completely at a loss for what to do.\n\nThis post is my attempt to understand why we experience grief when this happens, especially for such an extended period of time. My theory is that we experience this type of grief precisely at the moment when we start to realize this person has fundamentally changed, because our mind desperately wants to cling on to the person they used to be. At this moment, we find ourselves stuck trying to reconcile the past (who they used to be) with the present (who they are now). And sometimes, we’ll rationalize or dismiss their behavior for temporary comfort.\n\nI think this mostly comes from a place of love and loyalty, but part of me also worries about the consequences of finding ourselves stuck here for too long. In the next section, I’ll try to explain my understanding of this emotion, but I recognize that I might be off—and I definitely have more questions than answers. If you have other theories, I would love to hear them!\n\nWhen we meet someone for the first time, we construct an image of this person in our heads. And whether we realize it or not, this image is updated with each subsequent interaction we have with this person. (Of course, this is a bit more complicated for people who have always been around, like family members, given that we begin constructing this image from childhood—a time when we have little life experience to best inform the image we’re creating. Similarly, this image creation process applies to ourselves, which means we can also experience grief for our past selves when we go through a monumental change.)\n\nAre they trustworthy? Do they like me? Are they fun, intimidating, confusing? How do I feel when I’m around them? Who do they remind me of, and what other similarities do they share with this person? Are they still trustworthy?\n\nAnd on, and on, and on.\n\nAs our relationship with someone deepens and becomes more complex over time, so too does our image of them. Suddenly, this image includes thousands of little updates and revisions due to good and bad memories, solicited and unsolicited input from other people, projections of our desires and expectations and insecurities, plus a number of other factors—and with enough time, this image sticks.\n\nIt becomes increasingly difficult to make any updates that might strongly contradict our existing image of this person.\n\nI believe this specific instance is when we experience this unique grief for the living—when the contradictions are too overwhelming for us to accept or peacefully incorporate into the image we’ve created of someone, making us feel like we’re stuck.\n\nI’m not talking about the inconvenient but minor updates that we make all the time, such as realizing that someone is always late rather than punctual, or is messy rather than clean, or hates your favorite show or music genre, or is not always aligned with your political beliefs, or is naturally changing as they mature. These realizations simply help us see others as real people who exist outside of our projections of them. In a way, these updates are good, and in many cases harmless!\n\nInstead, we experience this grief when something happens that requires a complete reassessment of the person in question; when the only way to understand and accept who they are now is to stop clinging on to our image of who they used to be.\n\nPhysically, the person is the same—psychologically, they might as well be a stranger.\n\nHopefully, an experience like this is rare. It might happen when someone you know struggles with addiction (the HBO show Euphoria depicts this transformation really well); changes due to severe mental illness; becomes abusive, cheats, or betrays you… you get the point. A change that is more shocking or distressing than the inevitable changes that people go through over time.\n\nThese changes, for lack of a better term, might happen suddenly or gradually. For example: finding out your partner cheated might be a sudden change that causes you to grieve the image you had of them, while watching someone you love fall into an addiction might be a gradual change that also causes grief and a reassessment of how your relationship should function from that point.\n\nBut it is then—once we are made aware of the change(s)—that our image shatters and we experience this unique type of grief, finding ourselves stuck trying to reconcile our “before” image of the person with the new information we’ve gathered.\n\nWhat causes us to be stuck here? And why do some people stay in this stage for months, years, or even a lifetime? One obvious answer is shock, or denial. But to dig a little deeper: I think most of us are scared to let go of the “before” image, because doing so metaphorically kills off the person we used to know. And death in any form is an uncomfortable topic; one that we have not yet, and perhaps will never, come to understand or make peace with. There’s also the fear that we’re giving up on someone we love, so we find (sometimes unhealthy) ways to revive our hope in this person.\n\nThis happens in the stuck phase, when we’re still trying to grapple with the change(s).\n\nIt might especially be difficult for us to move past the stuck phase if the person still exhibits characteristics from the “before” image we hold of them—and they most likely do. We might feel stuck because these characteristics elicit memories which give us hope that this person didn’t actually change.\n\nI’m particularly interested in how we can come to terms with these changes and move past the stuck stage. Perhaps then, our assessment of the person can be more realistic, allowing us to approach our relationship with them in a healthier or more productive or less emotionally distressing way. Or to leave completely and find peace in our loss.\n\nObviously, a lot of context is required here; each solution will be as unique as the situation it is addressing. Maybe acceptance is the answer for this type of grief. Or maybe the right answer is to keep fighting and not lose hope. Maybe it’s something else entirely.\n\nWhat’s interesting here, and perhaps a topic for another day, is the perspective from the person who is undergoing the change(s) we talked about. After all, there is some truth to the idea that people leave when you need them most, when you are going through a very difficult time, when you are at your most broken. In part, it could be because difficult times can bring out the worst in people; it also could be because difficult times really are a true test of loyalty. But this shift in perspective raises a lot of questions for how to best deal with this situation. Again: do you leave? Do you accept the situation? Do you try to solve it? Do you fight for change? How do you balance your needs with the needs of the person you’re grieving?\n\nThe point I’m trying to make: I have no idea what the best approach is for handling this type of grief, and I don’t know if there is one. In fact, at the moment, I’m okay accepting that this type of grief is just part of the human condition—an experience that we can’t hack or eliminate.\n\nAt the same time, I’m hopeful that these experiences, while difficult, don’t have to destroy us. To end this post on a more hopeful note, here is a lovely quote (of a quote) from one of my favorite books, The Telomere Effect:\n\nAs Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, a Swiss psychiatrist who studied grief and mourning, once said: The most beautiful people we have known are those who have known defeat, known suffering, known struggle, known loss, and have found their way out of the depths.\n\nThese persons have an appreciation, a sensitivity, and an understanding of life that fills them with compassion, gentleness, and a deep loving concern.\n\nBeautiful people do not just happen.\n\nThere was a lot left unsaid in this piece (and definitely more questions raised than answered), largely because this is a complex topic with little written about it, and it’s rare to find someone who has successfully navigated this type of loss and found peace with it.\n\nArt helps bridge the gap between the feelings we can articulate, and those we cannot. Here is my attempt to bridge that gap. I hope you enjoy some pieces that really resonated with me while writing this post:\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

I’ve been trying to make that feel like my purpose again.\n\nIn that spirit, here are some readings and ideas that I’ve found interesting recently.\n\nErik Hoel argues that art generated by AI is not real art because no conscious beings created it. Art is ultimately about expression—a connection between two points of consciousness. Per Tolstoy, “the aim of works of art is to infect people with the emotion the artist has experienced.” If you find a potato that just happens to look like a face, that's not art because no emotion or intention went into the making of the potato.\n\nIt wasn’t until reading this piece that I realized I’d always held a deflationary view of art, as Hoel calls it. If you’d asked me what art was before this piece, I’d have said: anything that someone looks at and finds beautiful. But then “beautiful” and “art” become synonyms:\n\nWithout taking into account the consciousness of the artist, the word “art” loses all meaning, becoming merely a synonym for “beautiful.” We may find something pretty, or interesting, or striking, or pleasing, but none of these mean that it is art. Without the intentionality of the artist taken into account, the definition of “art” is bled of all meaning, all differentiation, all usefulness as a term. This is why deflationary theories of art, like how art is “whatever is in an art gallery” or “whatever anyone says” or “whatever pleases the senses” are all unsatisfying as definitions, for they strip the word “art” of all capacity to do the job of a word, which is to differentiate.\n\nThe job of a word is to differentiate; art and beauty are differentiated by the fact that art requires intentionality, while beauty does not.\n\nA commenter makes a good counterargument that AI-generated art actually does involve human consciousness, making it no less real than art made by humans:\n\nIf you actually dive into the creation of Dalle-2 — the crude attempt of apes to recreate the part of themselves that conceives, the way the neural nets are forced into desperate (mathematical) free-fall through millions of human-labelled images — there is in fact intrinsic substance behind Dalle. Pollock drips, cavemen place a hand on the wall, Pistoletto smashes mirrors, and AI researchers force mathematical constructs to reverse the diffusion of pictures. You see Dalle as devoid of humans, like a rock, but I see it as fiercely, farcically, tragically, human, like a cathedral.\n\nInteresting to think about “life stories” as an object of study — how do people frame their life stories? What are common patterns and themes? How does it differ for people with mental illness? How do life stories correlate with well-being?\n\nPeople with schizophrenia tend to have disjointed, incoherent life stories. But over time with certain cognitive therapies, they rebuild a life story centered on redemption and agency. Very uplifting stuff.\n\nWhen I was in my late teens or early 20s I would sometimes be in the early stages of dating someone and feel like there was a glass wall between us, I just didn’t really get them, I didn’t know what they wanted from me, and it was so hard for me to have any clarity about who they really are. But I would be like, well, objectively this person is hot and smart and cool. So why wouldn’t I want to date them? Answer: because you can’t really talk to them, dumbass.\n\nSometimes you like someone and you can’t tell whether they like you back. This article made me realize that it’s not attractive or cool or mysterious that you don't know what they're feeling. It's literally just stupid.\n\nThe inability to communicate is not an indication of some flaw of yours or some hidden incompatibility that you can't figure out. The inability to communicate literally is the incompatibility.\n\nDespite having become acquainted with Buddhism and meditation for a few years now, I only just learned from this podcast the categorization of different philosophies/practices:\n\nSutric view: renunciation is the goal. attachments are the source of suffering. we must drop attachments.\n\nTantric view: renunciation is not the goal, transformation is the goal. attachment is not the problem. you’re supposed to be “in and of” the world.\n\nDzogchen: there is nothing to be transformed. the mind is perfect as is. (per Jake and Christofer, this view is technically true, but not helpful for someone just starting out.)\n\nJake and Christofer land on a helpful definition of the elusive concept of emptiness . To the untrained mind, our conscious experience seems to have this solidity that you can grasp; emptiness is about the un-graspability of experience. It's like trying to grasp air.\n\nIn this sense emptiness seems very analogous to the nebulosity stuff that David Chapman talks about. Nebulosity is why we can't \"pin down\" categories in reality, which is a kind of grasping.\n\nMeditation teacher Shinzen Young, when asked by a student, \"what if there are things I don't want to let go of? e.g. projects, my marriage, my kids”, responded: “the only thing we are ever called to let go of is our present moment sensory experience.”\n\nOne of the appeals of rationalism—of believing that the truth and the categories of the world are definite—is that it enables control and prediction.\n\nThe less you cling to free will, the more agency you have.\n\nNominative determinism is the view that “people that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names”—consider e.g. Usain Bolt (the fastest human ever), or William Wordsworth (poet), or William Headline (journalist at CNN).\n\nI agree with Roger’s Bacon conclusion that the effect of one’s name, if it does exist, is small at most. Your name is not your destiny. But I was struck by his insight that our practice of assigning permanent names at birth is itself a cultural practice, not something to be taken for granted:\n\nThe virtually universal practice of assigning a permanent name at birth (which only exists so that governments can more easily tax us) has caused a species-wide shift towards a more narcissistic and egotistical mode of being.\n\nMaybe this goes too far (or not far enough…), but the more general idea I’m trying to raise is that personal nomenclature is never value neutral and never without cultural and psychological ramifications. In other words, we shouldn’t be surprised that our culture has become sterile, stagnant, and individualistic to a fault when those values are embedded in the way we name ourselves.\n\nThere’s a widespread meme out there that we’re nearing the end of our discovery of new knowledge and it’s gonna get harder and harder to come up with new ideas. That there’s a small set of true or useful theories out there and we’ve already encountered the vast majority of them.\n\nMastroianni makes many strong arguments against this view:\n\nWe’ve believed this many times before (e.g. in the 1890’s leading physicists believed that physics was “basically over”, before it was revolutionized 30 years later by Einstein).\n\nNew ideas always look easy in retrospect but were actually hard to come up with at the time (e.g. Darwin’s theory of evolution).\n\nDiscoveries beget more discoveries. Ideas compose a graph, not a fixed linear sequence of discoveries. Each new idea opens the door to more possible ideas.\n\nNew ideas compress and synthesize previous ideas. You don’t need to learn everything from scratch to understand the modern theories of a field.\n\nI’m puzzled by the claim that scientists must labor under an ever-increasing burden of knowledge . The author of that paper writes: “If one is to stand on the shoulders of giants, one must first climb up their backs, and the greater the body of knowledge, the harder this climb becomes.” This suggests that if you peek into PhD programs, you’ll see lots of students bent over their books, desperately trying to learn everything that’s come before so they can start their own projects. “I can’t do any physics yet,” you might hear them lament. \"I’m only up to Huygens !” Instead, you’ll see PhD students doing original research from Day 1—and often long before. Indeed, many students start doing more interesting work once they stop looking at lots of previous work, as it finally frees them from imitating other people and searching for “gaps in the literature,” two strategies that are unlikely to yield anything interesting.\n\nAndrés Gómez-Emilsson has spent years putting together a formal theory of the structure of conscious experiences. In this piece he describes how our conscious perception of time (phenomenal time) may be related to physical time (the ticking of the universe’s clock).\n\nHe contrasts two philosophies of time: presentism (the view that only the present “actually exists” at a given moment, that the future and past are abstractions) and eternalism (the view that all moments of time exist equally, and the present only looks like special because of our limited conscious perspective).\n\nWhile most of our theories of physics seem to suggest eternalism (in general relativity, time is just an additional dimension on an existing 4-dimensional spacetime thingy), our conscious perception strongly suggests presentism.\n\nGómez-Emilsson paints one theory for how our conscious experience of time is created: our sensory systems take a bunch of snapshots in physical time, and each individual “moment” of experience is really a bunch of these snapshots superimposed on each other, with the most recent snapshot having the highest weight. (Kind of like Apple’s Live Photos.)\n\nWhen time feels slow, what’s happening is that a larger number of snapshots are being blended together. The “after-images” of recent inputs last longer. When time feels fast, the opposite is happening.\n\nMuch of neuroscience over the past few decades has consisted of map-making: charting out the connections between regions in the brain and figuring out which parts are responsible for what. But a map is not an explanation. Creating detailed maps is just the first step towards coming up with an actual theory of how our brain works.\n\nCase in point: the C. elegans nervous system has been mapped out completely—we know every connection between all 302 neurons the worm has. And yet, we still don’t understand how any of this generates the worm’s behavior. (For scale, humans have ~100 billion neurons.)\n\nDavid Poeppel is interested in language specifically. How does our brain parse the unstructured sound waves that enter our ears into structured, grammatical, meaningful communication? We still have no clue, but Poeppel has conducted an interesting experiment showing that brain waves are coupled with the high-level rhythms of speech.\n\nNeuroscientists have known that your brain “breathes” —we can measure (with an EEG) rhythmic patterns of neural firing that span large swathes of the cortex. These waves occur at a number of different frequencies: some are faster, some are slower. What Poeppel has found is that there are brain waves that seem to match the cadence of incoming speech, at multiple hierarchical levels:\n\nthere are brain waves that are coupled to the individual syllables we hear\n\nthere are other brain waves coupled to the word phrases (e.g. “dry fur”, “big cat”)\n\nand then there are brain waves that are coupled to entire sentences (e.g. “dry fur rubs skin”)\n\nThey ran a number of different experiments to confirm that the brain waves are actually coupled to the structure of the speech rather than just the rhythms in the sound itself. The details are in the lecture . The takeaway, though, is that our brain must be generating and computing over abstract structures that aren’t there in the raw stimulus. (Assuming that our interpretations of the brain wave data are correct, of course.)\n\nThere’s a higher-level question here about how the brain works: does the brain build discrete abstract units, that interact with one another based on rules? Or is it like a giant machine learning system, with continuously shifting weights, inferring statistical relationships between inputs and outputs? (Are these mutually exclusive?) Poeppel’s experiment is a nudge in the former direction: the brain does create abstract structures that are not just derivative of statistical relationships in the input. Poeppel’s hunch is that the brain is materially different (no pun intended) from modern deep learning systems:\n\nRemember that humans can learn things on experimental trial number one, learn complex ideas from sparse data, extrapolate insights that were never in the training data, and say things that they’ve never heard before. And remember that humans have generativity and compositionality. So scientists working on human cognition might look over and see what can be learned from huge statistical models, and we do learn things from those statistical models, but it simply doesn’t follow that that’s somehow the answer to how human brains are organized.\n\nTime will tell. When I look at the state of modern neuroscience I can’t help but think that there is so much understanding ahead of us; we’re where Newton was with physics, or Hooke with biology.

best ways to help others with your career, compared","link":"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs","content":"Many people think of Superman as a hero. But he may be the greatest example of underutilised talent in all of fiction. It was a blunder to spend his life fighting crime one case at a time; if he’d thought a little more creatively, he could have done far more good. How about delivering vaccines to everyone in the world at superspeed? That would have eradicated most infectious disease, saving hundreds of millions of lives.\n\nHere we’ll argue that a lot of people who want to “make a difference” with their career fall into the same trap as Superman. College graduates imagine becoming doctors or teachers – careers that help people directly. But these may not be the best fit for their particular skills. And like Superman fighting crime, these paths can often only help a limited number of people at once.\n\nIn contrast, Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner discovered blood groups, enabling hundreds of millions of life-saving operations. He would have never been able to carry out that many surgeries himself.\n\nAt the same time, many graduates feel unfulfilled in their careers because they don’t have a job that directly helps people. But there’s no need for this. It can be fulfilling to help indirectly as well, so by being more open-minded and creative about how to do good, more people can find a career that both uses their unique skills and helps others.\n\nBelow we’ll introduce four ways to use your career to help tackle the social problems you want to help work on (which we identified in the previous article ). The four ways are earning to give, advocacy, and research, as well as direct work. We’ll make concrete recommendations on how to pursue each approach.\n\nWould Bill Gates have done more good if he’d worked at a small nonprofit? We don’t normally think of software engineering as a path to doing good, but Gates has saved the lives of millions of children by funding vaccines. That’s a huge amount of good, even if you’re not keen on Microsoft.\n\nWe often meet people who are interested in a higher earning job, like software engineering, but are worried they won’t make a difference. Part of the reason is that we don’t usually think of earning more money as a path for people who want to do good. However, there are many effective organisations that have no problem finding enthusiastic staff, but don’t have the funds to hire. People who are a good fit for a higher earning option can donate to these organisations, and make a large contribution indirectly.\n\nEarning to give is not just for people who want to work in high paying industries. Anyone who aims to earn more in order to give more is on this path.\n\nConsider the story of Julia and Jeff, a couple from Boston with two children. Julia switched from nonprofit admin work to social work at a prison. Jeff used to work as research technician. He decided to train up to become a software engineer, and eventually got a job at Google. The couple were able to earn more than twice as much, so started to donate about half their income to charity each year.\n\nBy doing this, they probably have had more impact than they could by working directly in a nonprofit. Compare Jeff’s impact to that of the CEO of a nonprofit:\n\nJeff can live on about two times as much as he would have earned in the nonprofit sector, and still donate enough to fund the salaries of about two nonprofit CEOs. On top of this, he may also have some positive direct impact too, since Google has developed valuable innovations like Google Maps and Gmail; and he thinks he’s happier in his work because he enjoys engineering.\n\nMoreover, Jeff and Julia can switch their donations to whichever organisations are most in need of funds at any given time based on their research, whereas it’s harder to change where you work. This flexibility is particularly valuable because we don’t know which problems will be most pressing in the future.\n\nThis opportunity exists because (as we saw earlier ) we happen to live in a world with huge income inequality – it’s possible to earn several times as much as a teacher or nonprofit worker, and vastly more than the world’s poorest people. At the same time, hardly anyone donates more than a few percent of their income, so if you are willing to do so, you can have an amazing impact in a very wide range of jobs.\n\nEarlier, we also saw that any college graduate in a developed country can have a major impact by giving 10% to an effective charity. The average graduate earns $77,000 per year over their life, and 10% of that could save about 40 lives if given to the Against Malaria Foundation for example.\n\nIf you could just earn 10% more, and donate the extra, then that’s twice as much impact again. And if you think there are better organisations to fund than Against Malaria Foundation – perhaps working on different problems, or research or advocacy – the impact is even higher.\n\nSince we introduced the concept of “earning to give” in 2011, hundreds of people have taken it up and stuck with it. Most give around 30% of their income, and some more than 50%. Collectively, they’ll donate tens of millions of dollars to high impact charities in the coming years. In doing so, they are funding passionate people who want to contribute directly, but who otherwise wouldn’t have the resources.\n\nOne of the people we advised in 2011, Matt, has donated over $1m while still in his 20s, and was featured in the New York Times . He finds his job more enjoyable too.\n\nAnother quit his job as a software engineer and founded a startup. He has pledged all of his income above minimum wage to charity. If his startup’s current valuation is accurate, then he’ll give millions of dollars to charity in the next decade . His startup also reduces paperwork for doctors, and so it has direct impact too.\n\n“Without 80,000 Hours' research, I wouldn't have started this company; and without their community, I wouldn't have made it this far.”\n\nEarning to give has been our most memorable and controversial idea, attracting media coverage in the BBC , Washington Post , Daily Mail and many other outlets.\n\nFor this reason, many people think it’s our top recommendation. But it’s not: it depends on your situation.\n\nWe think earning to give is an option worth considering when:\n\nCan people actually stick with it? Won’t they end up being influenced by their peers to spend the money on luxuries rather than donating? We were worried this would happen when we first introduced the idea, but it hasn’t. Hundreds of people are pursuing earning to give and while some have left because they thought they could do more good elsewhere, no-one we know has simply given up their plans to donate. In part, this is because many people pursuing earning to give made public pledges of their intentions to donate, often through Giving What We Can . The existence of a community that earns to give also makes it much easier to stick with today.\n\nDon’t many high earning jobs cause harm? We don’t recommend taking a job that does a lot of harm in order to donate the money. In practice, most people who earn to give work in the fields of technology, asset management, medicine or consulting, and we think these positions do a small amount of good, or are neutral. For instance, many (but not all ) financial traders make profits at the expense of other traders, so they’re moving money around, mostly from rich people to other rich people . Of course, there are some people who cause harm in these industries, but that’s true of any industry.\n\nMore broadly, there are lots of ways to earn more money, and we doubt all of these are harmful. What about medicine, engineering or private tutoring? There is also the option to make the industry better from the inside. If you’re socially motivated and you replace someone who doesn’t care about the harm they do, that may well be better for the world.\n\nWhat if I wouldn’t be motivated doing a high earning job? In that case, don’t do one. We only recommend earning to give if it’s a good fit. Just bear in mind, as we covered previously , that you can become interested in more jobs than you might think.\n\nCouldn’t I have more impact doing something else? There’s a good chance that you could, as we cover later in the article.\n\n(To go into the ethics of earning to give in more depth, see this paper we published.)\n\nTo learn about how to best earn to give – including recommendations of which jobs to take – see this article:\n\nAs we’ve seen, many social interventions have no proven impact , and many other charities are poorly run black boxes. So if you give to the wrong organisation, you won’t achieve much.\n\nOn the other hand, so long as there’s at least one highly effective organisation to fund, then earning to give can be high impact. You don’t even need to limit yourself to funding charities – you could fund research, political advocacy or for-good for-profits instead.\n\nOne alternative to earning to give is advocacy – the promotion of solutions to pressing problems. Advocacy can also be pursued in a wide range of careers, and can be even higher impact than earning to give.\n\nConsider the following options:\n\nThe second path does more good – in fact probably about twice as much – and this illustrates the power of advocacy.\n\nMany of the highest impact people in history have been advocates of one kind or another. Take Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus, sparking a protest which led to a Supreme Court ruling that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Parks was a seamstress in her day job, but in her spare time she was very involved with the civil rights movement. After she was arrested, she and the NAACP worked hard and worked strategically, staying up all night creating thousands of fliers to launch a total boycott of buses in a city of 40,000 African Americans, whilst simultaneously pushing forward with legal action. This led to major progress for civil rights.\n\nThere are also many examples you don’t hear about, like Viktor Zhdanov, who was one of the highest impact people of the twentieth century.\n\nIn the twentieth century, smallpox killed around 400 million people, far more than died in all wars and political famines. Credit for the elimination often goes to D.A. Henderson, who was in charge of the World Health Organization’s elimination programme. However, the programme already existed before he was brought on board. In fact, he initially turned down the job. The programme would probably have eventually succeeded even if Henderson hadn’t accepted the position.\n\nZhdanov single-handedly lobbied that WHO to start the elimination campaign in the first place. Without his involvement, it would not have happened until much later, and possibly not at all .\n\nSo why has advocacy been so effective in the past?\n\nFirst, ideas can spread quickly, so advocacy is a way for a small group of people to have a large effect on a problem. A small team can launch a social movement, lobby a government, start a campaign that influences public opinion, or just persuade their friends to take up a cause. In each case, they can have a lasting impact on the problem that goes far beyond what they could achieve directly.\n\nSecond, advocacy is neglected. This is because there’s usually no commercial incentive to spread socially important ideas. Instead, advocacy is mainly pursued by people willing to dedicate their careers to making the world a better place.\n\nAdvocacy is also neglected because it’s uncomfortable to stand up to the status quo, and it’s often difficult to see the effect of your efforts, which makes it less motivating than doing good directly. Zhdanov was more important to the elimination effort than Henderson, but Henderson got the credit. For these reasons, advocacy can be a high impact path for those who are willing to step up.\n\nIn fact, there’s reason to think that advocacy is typically better than earning to give. One reason for this is that everyone wants more money so there’s a lot of competition, which places a limit on how much you can easily earn (and subsequently donate). There’s a lot less competition to spread good ideas, for the reasons we just discussed. So we expect that it would be possible for many people to influence more money than they could donate.\n\nAdvocacy is also an area where the most successful efforts do far more than the typical efforts in the field. The most successful advocates influence millions of people, while others might struggle to persuade more than a few friends. This means if you’re a good fit for advocacy, it’s often the best thing you can do, and you’re likely to achieve far more by doing it yourself than you could by funding someone to engage in advocacy on your behalf.\n\nIf you’re interested in pursuing a career in advocacy – including recommendations of specific types of jobs – see our full article:\n\nPeople often pan academics as Ivory Tower intellectuals whose writing has no impact. And we agree there are many problems with academia that mean researchers achieve less than they could. However, we still think research is often high impact, both within academia and outside.\n\nAlong with advocates, many of the highest impact people in history have been researchers. Consider Alan Turing. He was a mathematician who developed code breaking machines that allowed the Allies to be far more effective against Nazi U-boats in WW2. Some historians estimate this enabled D-day to happen a year earlier than it would have otherwise. Since WW2 resulted in 10 million deaths per year, Turing may have saved about 10 million lives.\n\nAnd he invented the computer.\n\nTuring’s example shows that research can both be theoretical and high impact. Much of his work concerned the abstract mathematics of computing, which wasn’t initially practically relevant, but became important over time.\n\nOn the applied side, we saw lots of examples of high impact medical research earlier in this guide .\n\nOf course, not everyone will be an Alan Turing, and not every discovery gets adopted. Nevertheless, we think research on average is effective, and frequently better than working directly on a problem. Why?\n\nFirst, when new ideas are discovered they can be spread incredibly cheaply, so it’s a way that a single career can change a field. Moreover, new ideas accumulate over time, so research contributes to a significant fraction of long-run progress.\n\nHowever, only a relatively small fraction of people are engaged in research. Only 0.1% of the population are academics, and the proportion was much smaller throughout history. If a small number of people account for a large fraction of progress, then on average each person’s efforts are significant.\n\nSecond, this is exactly what we’d expect from economic theory. Most researchers don’t get rich, even if their discoveries are extremely valuable. Turing made no money from the discovery of the computer, whereas today it’s a multibillion dollar industry. This is because the benefits of research come a long time in the future, and can’t usually be protected by patents. This means there’s little commercial incentive to do research relative to its importance. So if you do care more about social impact than profit, then it’s a good opportunity.\n\nIn fact, the more fundamental the research, the harder it is to commercialise, so, all else equal, we’d expect fundamental research to be more neglected than applied research, and therefore (all else equal) higher impact. On the other hand, applied issues can be more urgent – applied breakthroughs like the telescope can let us make fundamental breakthroughs faster – so it’s hard to say whether applied or fundamental research is more pressing on average.\n\nLike advocacy, research is especially promising when you’re a good fit, because the best researchers achieve much more than the median. Most papers only have 1 citation, whereas the top 0.1% of papers have over 1,000 citations . And when we did a case study on biomedical research , remarks like this were typical:\n\nOne good person can cover the ground of five, and I’m not exaggerating.\n\nIf you might be a top 10% researcher in a pressing problem area, then it’s likely to be the highest impact path for you.\n\nSee our full guide to doing high-impact research, both within and outside academia:\n\nExample: Hauke became unsatisfied with his potential for impact in academia during a neuroscience PhD. He applied to almost all our top recommended career paths, and was offered a position by Giving What We Can. He now leads their efforts to research the cost-effectiveness of different charities.\n\n“Seriously, keep reading this career guide. It's damn, damn good.”\n\nBecoming an academic administrator doesn’t sound like a high impact career, but that’s exactly why it is. Research requires administrators, managers, grant makers, and communicators to make progress. Many of these roles require very able people who understand the research, but because they’re not glamorous or highly paid, it can be hard to attract the right people. For this reason, if a role like this is a good fit for you, then it can be promising. What ultimately matters is not who does the research, but that it gets done.\n\nA hero of ours is Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh. He studied for a PhD in comparative genomics, but ultimately decided to pursue academic project management. He became a manager at the Future of Humanity Institute, which undertakes neglected research into emerging catastrophic risks, like engineered pandemics. He did a heroic amount of work behind the scenes to keep things running as funding rapidly grew. When there was an opportunity to start a new group in Cambridge, he used what he’d learned to lead efforts there too – at one point managing both groups. The field would have moved much more slowly without his management. Learn more in this interview with Sean .\n\nIf you’re interested in these positions, the best path is usually to pursue a PhD, pick a field, then apply to research groups.\n\nIf you do want to help directly, how can you do that most effectively?\n\nThe problem with many direct work positions is that they’re not neglected. For instance, earlier in the guide we saw that clinical doctors in rich countries don’t usually have a large impact because there are already many doctors in these countries, so the most important and impactful procedures are going to get done anyway. We also saw that neglected areas are higher-impact due to diminishing returns.\n\nAnother problem is that many want to work at organisations that are more constrained by funding than by the number of people enthusiastic to work there. This means if you don’t take the job, it would be easy to find someone else who’s almost as good. Think of a lawyer who volunteers at a soup kitchen. It may be motivating for them, but it’s hardly the most effective thing they could do. Donating one or two hours of salary could pay for several better trained people to do the work instead. Or they could do pro bono legal work, and contribute in a way that makes use of their valuable skills.\n\nOther direct work positions limit your potential influence. Think of Superman fighting criminals one by one, or Dr Landsteiner trying to work really hard to perform more surgeries rather than discovering blood groups.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of other situations when working directly is the most effective thing to do. There are many great teams working on innovative, neglected solutions to pressing problems. If you’re a good fit for one of these, and they’re finding it hard to hire (they are “talent constrained” ), then it can be the best option. Learn more about working at effective nonprofits .\n\nIf an effective organisation doesn’t exist within the area, then you could help found one. This was our thinking with 80,000 Hours: we knew no-one else was systematically doing this research.\n\nHere’s another area where this might be true. As of the last decade, several very large foundations have been created that want to fund charities that carry out evidence-based health interventions, such as the Gates Foundation, CIFF, and Open Philanthropy (which is partnered with GiveWell). However, these foundations are short of projects that meet their criteria. If you could build expertise in getting health interventions efficiently implemented, you could raise tens of millions in funding from these foundations, and have far more impact than earning to give.\n\nThis is what Joey and Kate are doing. They left college early to focus on fundraising for charities like Against Malaria Foundation. However, they realised it would be even higher impact to try to set up something new. They spent six months reviewing a list of health interventions, and found one that looked effective, was simple to roll out, but didn’t have a charity focusing on it.\n\nThey settled on text reminders for vaccinations in India, which have been shown in four randomised controlled trials to make it significantly more likely for people to get vaccinated. They’re now setting up this organisation and already have raised $200,000 from Open Philanthropy.\n\nHowever, you don’t need to be the leader of an organisation. As with research management, operations roles are both vital and difficult, but because these positions are unglamorous, it’s often hard to attract the right people.\n\nFinally, direct work can be for-profit as well as nonprofit. For instance, Send Wave enables African migrant workers to transfer money to their families through a mobile app for fees of 3%, rather than 10% fees with Western Union. So for every $1 of revenue they make, they make some of the poorest people in the world several dollars richer. They’ve already had an impact equivalent to donating millions of dollars, and they’re growing quickly. The total size of the market is hundreds of billions of dollars, and several times larger than all aid spending. If they can slightly accelerate the roll out of cheaper ways to transfer money, it’ll have a big impact.\n\nIf you’re providing a service directly to beneficiaries, a for-profit is likely to be more effective because you get better feedback on whether your service is useful, and you can scale up more quickly. (We’ll be collecting more advice on doing good in for-profits in our tech entrepreneurship review .) Nonprofits are best when they’re doing something that’s very hard to commercialise, such as research, advocacy, helping the extreme poor, and the provision of public goods like a clean environment, or services like education that take a long-time to pay off.\n\nHowever, sometimes it’s even possible to use for-profits to do socially important research and provide public goods. Elon Musk’s Tesla sells fancy electric cars to rich people, which isn’t very high impact. But the real mission of the company is to develop cheaper batteries that will make it much easier to transition to a green economy, and eventually electrify all of transport. Musk also created SpaceX, which makes money by selling cheap rockets to NASA, but the real mission of the company is to speed up the colonisation of space , and make humanity more likely to survive a disaster on Earth.\n\nIf you want to find a job with direct positive impact:\n\nHere are some jobs we’d especially recommend working towards:\n\nWhat about if you want to found an organisation?\n\nOne mistake people make is trying to work out which organisations are needed from their armchair, or by choosing an issue that they’ve happened to come across in their own lives. Instead, go and learn about big, neglected social problems . Take a job in the area, do further study and speak to lots of people working on the problem, to find out what the world really needs. You need to get near the edge of an area before you’ll spot the ideas others haven’t, and have the connections you’ll need to execute.\n\nWe’ve now seen that by thinking broadly – considering earning to give, advocacy, and research as well as direct work – you can find many more ways to make a big contribution to pressing problems.\n\nHopefully that has given you some new ideas for jobs you could take. Now, how do you narrow these options down to find the best one?\n\nThe first thing to note is that these four approaches are not exclusive, and you can do more than one at the same time. For instance, a teacher helps their students (direct impact), but could also develop new educational techniques (research) or tell their students about pressing problems (advocacy). We know a teacher who did private tutoring in order to donate more (earning to give). As we’ve seen, often your impact is more about how you use your position than the position itself. This means, you’ll want to look for the positions that offer the best balance of ways to contribute directly, through advocacy and through donations. In our career reviews , we assess each path on these three ways of contributing.\n\nThe second point is that there is no single best approach for every problem. Rather, focus on the approaches that are most needed by the problems you want to solve. For instance, breast cancer doesn’t need more social advocacy to promote awareness, because almost everyone is aware that breast cancer is a problem. Instead, it probably needs more skilled researchers to develop better treatments. If you just focus on raising awareness, then your efforts won’t go as far. We highlight which skills are most needed within each area in our problem profiles .\n\nThird, do something where you have the chance to excel. Throughout this article, there is a vital general principle to bear in mind: the most successful people in a field have far more impact than the typical career. For instance, a landmark study of expert performers found:\n\nA small percentage of the workers in any given domain is responsible for the bulk of the work. Generally, the top 10% of the most prolific elite can be credited with around 50% of all contributions, whereas the bottom 50% of the least productive workers can claim only 15% of the total work, and the most productive contributor is usually about 100 times more prolific than the least.\n\nJust as we saw with choosing a problem , this means the most effective approach for you will be something you enjoy, that motivates you, and is a good fit for your skills. We sometimes come across people tempted to do a job they’d hate in order to have more impact. That’s likely a bad idea, since they’ll just burn out. Their example could also discourage others from doing good.\n\nAn outstanding charity worker will likely do more good than a mediocre engineer earning to give, and the reverse is also true.\n\nOn the other hand, as we’ve seen , people often underestimate how easily they can become interested in new jobs.\n\nWe explain more about the importance of personal fit and how to work out which career is best for you in a later article .\n\nIf you already have expertise in an area, then that should also be factored in. We have more specific advice broken down by area here , as well as in the career reviews and problem profiles.\n\nThere are many more paths to helping others in your career than we normally talk about. Bill Gates started as a software engineer, and saved millions of lives through earning to give. Rosa Parks was a seamstress, and helped to trigger the civil rights movement in America through advocacy. Alan Turing was a mathematician, and helped to end WW2 through research, as well as inventing the computer. Elon Musk is a businessman, but is helping to revolutionise the car and space industries to reduce risks to humanity’s future.\n\nMost people aren’t Bill Gates, but even at a normal graduate salary, anyone can have an astonishing impact through earning to give, literally saving hundreds of lives. And it’s often possible to do even more through advocacy, research or direct work.\n\nMoreover, if you focus on the approaches that are best suited to the problems you want to solve and where you have the best personal fit, you can do even more good again. And you can do this while having a more satisfying career too.\n\nIn this way, even if you don’t want to be a doctor or a teacher, it’s possible to do far more good with your career than is normally thought.\n\nBefore we move on, make an initial short list of high impact careers you could work towards in the long-run. The following steps may help:\n\nThe aim at this point is just to come up with more options. We’ll explain how to further narrow down in an upcoming article.\n\nIf you’d like to get more specific ideas on which careers to pursue, see our more recent article on high-impact careers which is more up-to-date and goes into more detail.\n\nIf you already have experience , read our advice by area .\n\nEarlier , we saw that an enjoyable and fulfilling job:\n\nWe’ve now also seen that the job that most helps others:\n\nPeople often ask us whether they should sacrifice what they enjoy in order to have a greater impact. But, as you can see above, doing good involves less sacrifice than it first seems. A personally satisfying job involves helping others, because that’s fulfilling. And a high impact job will also be personally satisfying, because if you don’t like your job you won’t be good at it and you’ll burn out. So there’s a lot of overlap.\n\nWe’ve also seen there are lots of ways to have a big impact with little, if any, sacrifice. So, rather than making sacrifices, the key thing to focus on is finding these highly effective ways to help.\n\nThat’s not to say there’s no trade-off at all. It’s unlikely that the very best career for you personally is also the one that most benefits the world. Ultimately, you’ll have to make a value judgement about how to weigh helping others against your own interests. But fortunately, the trade-off is much less than it first seems.\n\nYou probably can’t just walk into your dream job right away. Instead you’ll need to build your skills, connections and credentials – what we call career capital – and put yourself in a better position for the long-term. Especially early on in your career, it’s best to focus on both impact and career capital.\n\nIn the next article, we’ll look at how to build career capital and best position yourself for long-term success.\n\nOr see an overview of the whole 2017 career guide.\n\nYour career is your biggest opportunity to make a difference.

If you are like the thousands of people who have participated in life stories research around the world, you could probably tell a pretty good story about where you came from, how you became the person you are today, and where you are headed in the future. You might talk about your childhood experiences, your education or career, significant challenges or accomplishments, important relationships, or themes that connect your experiences together.\n\nHere are a few things you probably would not say:\n\nThese are excerpts from the stories of people living with schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder that can include delusions (strongly held beliefs that do not seem to fit reality), hallucinations (seeing, hearing or feeling things that are not there), disorganised thought and speech, loss of motivation, blunted emotional expression and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia is a rare but serious mental illness. Although it affects fewer than one in 100 people, schizophrenia’s worldwide disease burden , in terms of years lived with disability, is roughly equal to that of Alzheimer’s disease and alcohol abuse combined. This is because schizophrenia is a chronic, disabling condition that manifests early in life – it is commonly diagnosed between late adolescence and the early 30s.\n\nOur life stories help us to define and communicate who we are as people\n\nWhen asked to tell their life stories, people with schizophrenia tend to tell unusual ones. First, the basic chronology of the life story is shifted. Most people experience a ‘reminiscence bump’ in early adulthood, with many personally significant and relatively well-remembered events occurring between ages 15 to 30 (and especially between ages 20 and 24). For instance, we might form memories of graduating college, getting a first job, or starting or ending significant romantic relationships. These events become centrepieces of our life stories, defining who we are for decades to come. However, schizophrenia causes profound disruptions during these same years. People diagnosed with schizophrenia often become unable to care for themselves, lose valued roles and relationships, and undergo treatment. These experiences seem to curtail the reminiscence bump: rates of personally significant memories might steadily increase in the teenage years, then drop sharply following a diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n\nPeople living with schizophrenia also tend to include unusual kinds of experiences in their life stories, focusing on psychotic episodes, hospitalisations and traumatic events. Their life stories might even include vivid, emotionally intense experiences of psychotic symptoms themselves – for instance, vivid memories of being spied on, conspired against or chosen by God to save the world.\n\nIn short, people with schizophrenia tell unusual life stories about unusual kinds of personal experiences. But why do these stories matter? How might they impact mental health and wellbeing? And how might they change through treatment and recovery?\n\nAt the most basic level, these stories matter because many people living with schizophrenia want their life stories to be heard. As Robert Bayley, a musician and author who has lived with schizophrenia for the past 40 years, has explained : ‘It is often forgotten that there is a person behind the condition, with a fundamental need to be understood … We must be seen as individuals and not regarded as just a collection of symptoms.’\n\nPsychological research also shows that, generally speaking, our life stories help us to define and communicate who we are as people. For example, imagine a middle-aged man – let’s call him David – who tells you a story about his difficult experience growing up in a poor neighbourhood, how it opened his eyes to the hardship that children face living in poverty, and how it motivated him to pursue a tough but fulfilling career in social work.\n\nPeople with schizophrenia often describe a sense of getting profoundly lost in their own experience\n\nDo you feel like you got to know David’s personality, at least a little bit, from hearing this very rough outline of his story? If you did, you might be noticing some of the relevant psychological features of personal storytelling. Importantly, these features have less to do with the content of the story and more to do with how the story is told.\n\nDavid’s story, for instance, was clearly structured with a beginning, middle and end. It moved from painful beginnings toward positive emotion and agency. And David found meaning in his life story by connecting his past experiences to his present-day identity as a social worker. Psychologists who study narrative identity, or the ways in which we tell our life stories, might say that David expresses strong narrative structure, the motivational and affective theme of redemption (a movement from negative beginnings to a positive ending), and deliberate autobiographical reasoning to make sense of his past experiences.\n\nThese dimensions of narrative identity are interwoven with psychological wellbeing. Research has found that narrative identity variables, including redemption, are associated with wellbeing even when accounting for other relevant factors (such as income, personality traits and psychiatric diagnoses). In some cases, changes in narrative identity even precede changes in wellbeing: one study found that increases in narrated agency occurred earlier during psychotherapy, followed by improvements in mental health. Personal stories reflect and might even support people’s mental health by helping to give their lives a sense of meaning, purpose, unity and forward momentum into the future.\n\nIn contrast, people who experience poor wellbeing or mental illness tend to tell life stories that focus on unwanted emotions, passive responses to life events and alienation from people around them. In schizophrenia, this trend is amplified and reaches into all aspects of personal storytelling, as my colleagues and I outline in a recent review of the research literature. However, unlike most people who struggle with mental illness, people with schizophrenia often also describe a sense of getting profoundly lost in their own experience. While they are in the midst of this instability, they often have difficulty structuring personal stories in a way that listeners can understand. (This is evident in a sample of one person’s description of his childhood: ‘No, that happened there… where my father took out gold, and we were happy, we used to get up early and it was fantastic… cleaning.’)\n\nPeople with schizophrenia can also have trouble finding meaning in past events or connecting their past experiences to their present identity. Unlike David’s structured, meaningful life story of becoming a social worker, their life stories tend to be more fragmented and painful.\n\nFor instance, Janet Stewart, who works on a mental health team in Montreal supporting others with serious mental illness, has nevertheless struggled to find words for her own story of living with schizophrenia:\n\nIt’s not just that the life stories of people living with schizophrenia are marked by unusual experiences. Many of these individuals seem to miss out on the potential for coherently structured personal stories to provide meaning to events in their lives.\n\nYet life stories are living documents. As the years pass, research has found, it’s typical for much of the content of a life story to change. Some people repeat very little of the content of their life stories across subsequent versions. How might the life story change as individuals recover from psychotic disorders?\n\nRecovery from psychosis can be a deeply redemptive personal story\n\nAfter experiencing a psychotic episode and being diagnosed with a psychotic disorder, people face unique challenges to their personal identities. The symptoms of psychosis, and the general cognitive impairment that typically accompanies psychosis, can make people feel alienated from themselves. At the same time, the loss of roles and relationships and the internalisation of stigma against people with serious mental illness can make them feel disconnected from others. These processes help to explain how their life stories become so painful and fragmented.\n\nBut psychosis can also prompt personal growth. Many people diagnosed with psychotic disorders feel that they have learned important things about themselves through the experience of psychosis. As one person put it : ‘The experience answered a lot of questions I had about my identity in life … and gave me a humility in how I look at reality … I like to think it made me a better human.’\n\nI see similar experiences of personal growth in my clinical work in a specialty care programme for early psychosis. Some of the time, our patients need help managing delusions or hallucinations. But much of our time is spent helping our patients to build relationships, get jobs, complete college degrees, live independently and pursue valued goals. Rather than simply treating psychotic symptoms, we help young people build meaningful lives around their psychotic symptoms.\n\nThrough this recovery process, people living with psychotic disorders can change their personal stories. In fact, some psychological treatments – notably metacognitive reflection and insight therapy – are designed to support recovery by helping people build more elaborated and integrated understandings of themselves and their life stories. Even when life stories start out disjointed and difficult to understand, clinicians can help people to see themselves as more agentic, connected to others and socially valued by listening and helping to build structure in personal stories.\n\nWhen people living with a psychotic disorder feel agency and mastery over their lives, they are often able to recover functionally (eg, by living independently, working and maintaining stable relationships) even if they still experience psychotic symptoms. For many people, this is what recovery from psychosis looks like. And it can be a deeply redemptive personal story.\n\nBayley, the musician and author who reminded us that ‘there is a person behind the condition’, expresses this redemptive arc in his own life story. Despite struggling for decades with his symptoms and enduring frustration with society and the healthcare system, Bayley is not defined by these painful experiences. Rather, he has found ‘some kind of balance’ through art, music and writing. He has published a semi-autobiographical novel and released an album of his original compositions. A loving wife, friends and family, he says, ‘[keep] me as positive as I can be’. Ultimately, he writes, ‘I have been transformed from a vulnerable 16-year-old … to an individual, now 51, who has created works of literature and music, and studied the visual arts … I’ve managed to create a rich amount of work that I’m incredibly proud of.’\n\nBayley’s story illustrates how people diagnosed with psychotic disorders can live full and satisfying lives. And while they might face unique challenges in constructing and sharing their personal narratives, their stories are individual, complex and rich in potential for personal growth and redemption.

time to build institutions","link":"https://amirbolous.com/posts/institutions","content":"There is a common narrative in tech spheres that (hyper-growth) startups and venture capital are the most powerful driving forces that shape society and progress. Revenue and number of users are referenced as tangible numbers of people impacted. And venture is the capital allocator that make this possible. The oxygen of the system that fuels it and keeps it running and alive. I used to think that startups and venture were the main driving forces behind progress in society.\n\nI no longer think this is true. I no longer think that venture-funded startups are the best and only way to maximally impact society on a long-term horizon. It’s become clear that startups and deploying large amounts of capital are only one vector that influences society on one particular time-horizon.\n\nSteward Brand’s piece on Pace Layers talks about how society operates on functionally independent layers, which affect society on different time-scales.\n\nHe suggests the following pace-layers as a structure for how a healthy civilization should function, with the top being the fastest affecting layers, and the bottom being the slowest affecting layers of the system.\n\nIf a healthy civilization is composed of pace layers which operate on different timescales, then startups are the fast-affecting, top-of-the stack layers and culture, religion, and institutions are the slow-affecting, bottom of the stack layers.\n\nStartups and companies are designed to grow fast , institutions are designed to persist. Startups shape the next decades, institutions shape the next centuries. Startups finish the trajectory technology will take to reach society, institutions create and define what that trajectory initially looks like. Startups focus on surviving the next year, institutions focus on surviving the next decade. Startups focus on users, revenue, funding, institutions focus on systems, second-order effects, and externalities. Startups shape the way we act day-to-day but institutions shape our values, belief systems, and the way we think.\n\nThere are a couple of reasons why institutions are able to have this type of long-horizon impact and startups often are not.\n\nFirstly, by the time a technology is commercializable, and there is a market for a startup to access, it is almost a foregone conclusion. The startups of the next decade were mostly determined by the past twenty to thirty years (or older) of research and exploration.\n\nThe distinction here however isn’t just research (institutions) vs. entreprenuership (startups). The distinction is that work at the institution level is driven by a strong vision to chart the trajectory of a technology for the world before it exists, yet alone before there is a market for it.\n\nTime and time again, we see that the largest pivot points of technologies in society were in fact created and explored out of someone’s (or a group’s) desire to push a certain view into reality and invent on principle . Long before it was commercially viable, before the technology was mature, and definitely before a market existed for related problems. Look to Licklider who continued to push his world view of the personal computer before there was any notion of a symbiotic relationship between human and computer, let alone a market for it. Or Yann LeCun and Geoffrey Hinton working on research in neural networks in the 90s when everyone thought the work was a dead end. Or early crypto infrastrcutrue work that setup the base layers of the system before billions of dollars of capital flew into DeFi.\n\nThe startups of today came about because of the ethos, visions, and explorations of those decades before them. This is in fact when technologists have the most agency for shaping the trajectory of society and progress.\n\nNote, I use institutions to loosely define things like educational institutions (e.g. schools, colleges, etc.), research institutions (e.g research labs, certain DAOs, capital allocators for public goods, e.g. Gitcoin , EF etc.), and value or belief institutions (e.g. religion, online communities, organizations united by some common vision etc.).\n\nSecondly, startups are hinged mostly on financial capital. In order to secure funding, you need to be able to paint a narrative for why there is a large market your product can solve a problem for. However, as we’ve seen in today’s climate, financial capital is cheap.\n\nWhat is scarce and becoming increasingly valuable is all forms of other capital: social capital, human capital, cultural capital etc. Institutions have more agency in defining what capital they want to own and invest in, without the pressure of external forces and committments to shape their trajectory.\n\nThirdly, incentive structures in private enterprises drive optimizing for growth, in general, at all over costs. There is no room to consider opportunity cost. Institutions like the Etherem Foundation in comparison are always considering value over replacement - “if we don’t put a dollar into this, what’s the next best thing to put a dollar in?” This type of agency and optionality is valuable because\n\nthere’s alpha in exploring alternative paths even when they may not be immediately valuable. Direct effects are important, but they’re predictable. In contrast, it’s hard to reason about second-order effects but that is when technology has the most leverage to impact people, in the flavor of “don’t give a man a fish, teach him how to fish”.\n\nthere’s no good measure of opportunity costs in startups when the metrics that matter are things like revenue numbers and ROI. There is no good model for value or utility when the direct impact on growth is unclear, and so things that have the potential for more outsized second-order effects fall by the wayside in order to focus on concrete metrics.\n\nNote none of this is to say or imply that startups are not important or even less valuable than building institutions. Startups, like any functional pace layer, are an essential part of driving society forwards.\n\nHowever, I think that we systemtically undervalue the importance and outsized impact institutions have. Many startups feel detached from reality exploring an extremely niche, specific problem, meanwhile it seems like there is a lot of unexplored leverage in thinking about and trying to build better schools, better colleges, better cities, better research labs, better communities etc.\n\nProjects like Praxis , Gitcoin , EF , Verses , Atlas Futura , Reboot , and 0xparc are showing now more than ever the importance and potential this can have, and how crypto as a layer of infrastructure, can catalyze building these types of persistent institutions.\n\nInstitutions shape the way we act and think more than we realize. And they do this at different layers in both society and our lives. Culture controls the way we think and influences our actions. Religion and belief systems give us a set of rules and heuristics that we use to govern our lives by. Communities give us a sense of purpose and belonging which we define our identities by. Educational institutions teach us how to learn and influence what we choose to spend our lives working on . Cities give us a home and physical spaces to think, eat, share, learn, and be apart of each other’s lives. Countries give us patriotism and philosophies which we embody and uphold. And research, in all its forms of exploration, tinkering, inventing, and playing, shapes the future of technology before it becomes a reality.\n\nIf you want to help bring a technology that solves a problem to the masses, start a company. But if you want to work on problems a level deeper: if you want to shape the way we act and think, the way we learn and build, the way we explore and live, and the technologies worth bringing to the masses in the future, consider starting an institution.\n\nThanks to Brian and the crypto-philosophy group at EthUni for helping put into words some ideas which had been floating around in my head for a while\n\nConsider the differently paced components to be layers. Each layer is functionally different from the others and operates somewhat independently, but each layer influences and responds to the layers closest to it in a way that makes the whole system resilient. From the fastest layers to the slowest layers in the system, the relationship can be described as follows: Fast learns, slow remembers. Fast proposes, slow disposes. Fast is discontinuous, slow is continuous. Fast and small instructs slow and big by accrued innovation and by occasional revolution. Slow and big controls small and fast by constraint and constancy. Fast gets all our attention, slow has all the power","tokenFrequency":{"dead":1,"catalyz":1,"valuabl":4,"fish”":1,"fact":2,"pressur":1,"top":1,"predict":1,"constraint":1,"countri":1,"roi":1,"thought":1,"slowaffect":1,"none":1,"year":2,"matter":1,"deploy":1,"coupl":1,"spend":1,"etc":5,"notion":1,"resili":1,"undervalu":1,"follow":2,"foundat":1,"want":4,"power":2,"room":1,"lecun":1,"effect":4,"say":1,"first":1,"alpha":1,"general":1,"tangibl":1,"etho":1,"timescal":2,"order":2,"comput":2,"timehorizon":1,"whole":1,"extern":2,"better":5,"metric":2,"in”":1,"daytoday":1,"purpos":1,"long":1,"sens":1,"it":2,"take":1,"shape":10,"privat":1,"us":5,"project":1,"etherem":1,"belief":3,"pivot":1,"rememb":1,"secondord":3,"talk":1,"“don't":1,"largest":1,"float":1,"level":2,"focus":5,"oxygen":1,"societi":11,"even":2,"number":3,"dao":1,"vision":3,"communiti":3,"worth":1,"almost":1,"there":2,"hard":1,"alon":2,"view":2,"occasion":1,"hing":1,"centuri":1,"live":5,"eg":4,"howev":3,"geoffrey":1,"abl":2,"mani":1,"make":2,"compani":2,"altern":1,"work":6,"healthi":2,"civil":2,"detach":1,"third":1,"alloc":2,"fall":1,"contrast":1,"get":1,"progress":3,"outsiz":2,"access":1,"base":1,"lab":2,"billion":1,"agenc":3,"unclear":1,"govern":1,"influenc":4,"particular":1,"slow":6,"comparison":1,"set":1,"act":3,"systemt":1,"play":1,"less":1,"aliv":1,"group":2,"without":1,"common":2,"financi":2,"type":3,"big":2,"fastest":2,"longterm":1,"religion":3,"alway":1,"model":1,"use":3,"product":1,"true":1,"invest":1,"vs":1,"research":7,"propos":1,"fastaffect":1,"respond":1,"commerci":1,"we'v":1,"solv":2,"vers":1,"market":5,"independ":2,"dispos":1,"desir":1,"peopl":2,"idea":1,"realiz":1,"viabl":1,"technolog":9,"flavor":1,"constanc":1,"enterpris":1,"path":1,"trajectori":5,"revolut":1,"paint":1,"system":8,"forc":3,"larg":2,"futur":2,"setup":1,"determin":1,"time":3,"bring":2,"venturefund":1,"bottom":2,"":34,"concret":1,"most":2,"social":1,"twenti":1,"around":1,"import":4,"conclus":1,"choos":1,"way":9,"point":1,"clear":1,"potenti":2,"need":1,"start":2,"philosophi":1,"educ":2,"someon":1,"apart":1,"user":2,"earli":1,"becom":3,"neural":1,"thing":4,"matur":1,"main":1,"decad":4,"ethuni":1,"committ":1,"isn't":1,"crypto":2,"institut":22,"driven":1,"innov":1,"compos":1,"school":2,"teach":2,"“if":1,"public":1,"show":1,"distinct":2,"embodi":1,"specif":1,"defi":1,"ever":1,"fish":1,"loos":1,"revenu":3,"dollar":3,"word":1,"don't":1,"atlas":1,"surviv":2,"entreprenuership":1,"measur":1,"oper":3,"hypergrowth":1,"gitcoin":2,"forward":1,"next":6,"action":1,"run":1,"space":1,"startup":21,"human":2,"may":1,"second":1,"90s":1,"small":2,"suggest":1,"learn":4,"note":2,"cultur":3,"brand":1,"impact":6,"heurist":1,"somewhat":1,"continu":2,"growth":2,"physic":1,"like":7,"seem":1,"tech":1,"yet":1,"optim":1,"strong":1,"praxi":1,"extrem":1,"climat":1,"opportun":2,"came":1,"referenc":1,"waysid":1,"chart":1,"reason":2,"valu":4,"thank":1,"affect":3,"longhorizon":1,"citi":2,"one":2,"cost":3,"think":10,"topofth":1,"person":1,"maxim":1,"what":1,"narrat":2,"util":1,"let":1,"definit":1,"best":2,"accru":1,"ident":1,"compon":1,"impli":1,"keep":1,"hinton":1,"form":2,"amount":1,"invent":2,"immedi":1,"infrastrcutru":1,"creat":2,"steward":1,"design":2,"mass":2,"infrastructur":1,"share":1,"look":2,"essenti":1,"part":1,"0xparc":1,"defin":4,"replac":1,"stack":2,"often":1,"everyon":1,"relat":1,"describ":1,"man":1,"leverag":2,"fast":7,"technologist":1,"lot":1,"licklid":1,"finish":1,"vector":1,"consid":4,"network":1,"help":2,"feel":1,"differ":5,"pacelay":1,"longer":2,"tri":1,"reboot":1,"world":2,"behind":1,"patriot":1,"see":1,"meanwhil":1,"futura":1,"instruct":1,"foregon":1,"deeper":1,"commercializ":1,"nich":1,"pace":4,"push":2,"they'r":1,"increas":1,"give":5,"yann":1,"drive":4,"sphere":1,"explor":7,"capit":12,"reach":1,"head":1,"exist":2,"symbiot":1,"unit":1,"end":1,"build":4,"problem":5,"other":2,"possibl":1,"relationship":2,"initi":1,"organ":1,"put":3,"unexplor":1,"option":1,"past":1,"direct":2,"ventur":3,"flew":1,"secur":1,"home":1,"structur":2,"incent":1,"seen":1,"attent":1,"colleg":2,"slowest":2,"function":4,"certain":2,"older":1,"discontinu":1,"onlin":1,"thirti":1,"piec":1,"cheap":1,"control":2,"belong":1,"closest":1,"persist":2,"scarc":1,"eat":1,"brian":1,"horizon":1,"fuel":1,"grow":1,"fund":2,"layer":17,"realiti":3,"ef":2,"today":2,"cryptophilosophi":1,"uphold":1,"tinker":1,"good":3,"principl":1,"rule":1}},"19738":{"id":"19738","title":"Hundreds of Chinese citizens told me what they thought about the controversial social credit system","link":"https://theconversation.com/hundreds-of-chinese-citizens-told-me-what-they-thought-about-the-controversial-social-credit-system-127467","content":"Hundreds of Chinese citizens told me what they thought about the controversial social credit system\n\nDr. Xinyuan Wang receives funding from the European Research Council. You can read a more detailed version of this article at: https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/assa/2019/12/09/chinas-social-credit-system-the-chinese-citizens-perspective/\n\nUniversity College London provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation UK.\n\nThe Chinese social credit system has been given an unequivocally negative reception by the media in the west . Set to be rolled out nationwide in 2020, the system has even been described by one journalist as China’s “most ambitious project in social engineering since the Cultural Revolution”.\n\nOn the surface, this reaction is understandable. Once the system is fully implemented, Chinese citizens will be given a social credit score based on their deeds. For example, failure to pay a court bill or playing loud music in public may cause a low score. This score can dictate what rights people have. Those on the “blacklist” are prevented from buying plane or train tickets, for instance, as well as working as civil servants or in certain industries .\n\nThe fact that Big Data and facial recognition technology will be applied for the purpose of monitoring citizens raises various human rights concerns. Not surprisingly, the scheme has been described as a “digital dictatorship” and a “dystopian nightmare straight out of Black Mirror”.\n\nBut what these accounts lack is a sense of how the system is perceived from within China, which turns out to be rather complicated. My 16-month ethnographic study found that ordinary Chinese people perceive and accept the system differently – and most of them seem to welcome it.\n\nThe study, which I carried out in 2018-2019, examined the use of digital devices, such as smartphones, in Shanghai. Ethnography tries to minimise “artificial” encounters, such as surveys and interviews, in favour of being present with people in their everyday lives. My study was designed to gain a holistic understanding of ordinary Chinese people’s daily lives, with a particular focus on digital engagement which at times included dealing with big issues such as state digital surveillance. I let people talk freely about their feelings and ideas. I spoke to around 500 people and I spent at least 15 hours with around a third of these. Conversations about the social credit system came up naturally rather than through direct questioning.\n\nContrary to what many people in the west believe, in private and during informal talks among friends, ordinary Chinese are not shy or concerned about expressing their opinions about politics.\n\nLiving in China … you have to be always on guard against others as pits of fraud are everywhere.\n\nThese are the words of Mr Zhu, a man in his 40s. He was explaining his reluctance to let his mother use a smartphone as she may fall prey to online scammers. He was not alone in worrying about what is seen as an intensifying crisis of public morality. Another research participant (the mother of a newborn baby searching for a nanny) ended up installing secret cameras at home to help her choose a trustworthy one.\n\nThe people I spoke to seemed less concerned about giving up some privacy if it meant a significantly higher degree of security and certainty. And a lot of the people I spoke to perceived the new social credit system as a national project to boost public morality through fighting fraud and crime and combating what is currently seen as a nationwide crisis of trust .\n\nChina has experienced a rising number of fraud cases and scams, as well as major scandals in the food safety and pharmaceutical industries . There is a widely held consensus that the punishment for these offences is not enough to deter re-offending, with people committing crimes in one province and setting up a business in another the next day with few consequences. Some believe the social credit system will remedy this through the blacklisting system.\n\nThere is also another narrative which says that western society is “civilised” because of a long-existing credit system. But this narrative is largely based on an imagined version of western society. And many assume that the idea of a social credit system in China was actually imported from the west.\n\nPenyue, a retired teacher, complained about “uncivilised” deeds, such as spitting or littering in public and said: “Things in the west are better because they have a mature credit system, right?”\n\nSome see it as the equivalent of the more established concept of “credit-worthiness” or getting a good “credit” score (but in the moral, as opposed to the financial sense). There are many apocryphal stories linked to this myth, including one about a Chinese graduate who finds herself outside China in a western city and – despite being qualified – cannot secure a job, because of her past record of fare dodging on trains (an offence which stayed on her credit record).\n\nThe point of the story is that in western societies people who break even minor rules won’t be accepted (no matter how qualified), as there are consequences. Stories like this use “the west” as a moral showcase of what a “civilised” society should be.\n\nThese stories may be false, but they are true reflections of a commonly held belief that the problem was created by individualism and modernity in China and that the west dealt with the transition to modernity more effectively. China’s own transition from an agricultural collective society (where people always knew who they were dealing with) to a modern one characterised by reliance on strangers is ongoing, and people believe that navigating this requires guidance.\n\nThe erosion of mutual trust is also attributed to Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution, a turbulent period characterised by everyone denouncing everyone else , including friends and family. So citizens see there is a need for mechanisms that enable people to take full responsibility for, and be judged by, their deeds.\n\nChinese citizens have also tended to view life itself as credit and often refer to an old saying: “People are doing things, and the sky (tian) is watching.” This means that whatever one does, there is always a record of their deeds in the sky. The karma system is the standardisation of the relationship between human beings and supernatural powers. One can earn points by doing good deeds, but these can also be easily squandered through bad ones.\n\nI am not trying to adjudicate whether it is appropriate for modern China to play the role of Tian,

miss you so very much, Ryan – Letters of Note","link":"https://lettersofnote.com/2021/12/06/i-miss-you-so-very-much-ryan","content":"In December of 1984, 13-year-old Ryan White was given 6 months to live after contracting AIDS during a contaminated treatment for hemophilia, a blood condition with which he had lived since birth. By June of 1985, keen to resume as normal a lifestyle as possible, Ryan attempted to return to school; however, due to ignorance and an intense stigma that surrounded the virus in its infancy, his wish was denied by school officials unable to ignore a petition signed by fearful parents and teachers. Ryan died on 9th April 1990, by which time he had returned to education, regularly appeared on television to tell his story, and become a beacon of hope for fellow AIDS sufferers the world over. Twenty years after Ryan’s death, the following letter was written to Ryan by his friend, Elton John, who had been at Ryan’s bedside on the day of his death.\n\nTwenty years ago this month, you died of AIDS. I would gladly give my fame and fortune if only I could have one more conversation with you, the friend who changed my life as well as the lives of millions living with HIV. Instead, I have written you this letter.\n\nI remember so well when we first met. A young boy with a terrible disease, you were the epitome of grace. You never blamed anyone for the illness that ravaged your body or the torment and stigma you endured.\n\nWhen students, parents and teachers in your community shunned you, threatened you and expelled you from school, you responded not with words of hate but with understanding beyond your years. You said they were simply afraid of what they did not know.\n\nWhen the media heralded you as an “innocent victim” because you had contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion, you rejected that label and stood in solidarity with thousands of HIV-positive women and men. You reminded America that all victims of AIDS are innocent.\n\nWhen you became a celebrity, you embraced the opportunity to educate the nation about the AIDS epidemic, even though your only wish was to live an ordinary life.\n\nRyan, I wish you could know how much the world has changed since 1990, and how much you changed it.\n\nYoung boys and girls with HIV attend school and take medicine that allows them to lead normal lives. Children in America are seldom born with the virus, and they no longer contract it through transfusions. The insults and injustices you suffered are not tolerated by society.\n\nMost important, Ryan, you inspired awareness, which helped lead to lifesaving treatments. In 1990, four months after you died, Congress passed the Ryan White Care Act, which now provides more than $2 billion each year for AIDS medicine and treatment for half a million Americans. Today, countless people with HIV live long, productive lives.\n\nIt breaks my heart that you are not one of them. You were 18 when you died, and you would be 38 this year, if only the current treatments existed when you were sick. I think about this every day, because America needs your message of compassion as never before.\n\nRyan, when you were alive, your story sparked a national conversation about AIDS. But despite all the progress in the past 20 years, the dialogue has waned. I know you would be trying to revive it if you were here today, when the epidemic continues to strike nearly every demographic group, with more than 50,000 new infections in the United States each year. I know you would be loudly calling for the National HIV/AIDS Strategy that was promised by President Obama but has not yet been delivered. I know you would reach out to young people. I know you would work tirelessly to help everyone suffering from HIV, including those who live on the margins of society.\n\nIt would sadden you that today, in certain parts of the United States, some poor people with AIDS are still placed on waiting lists to receive treatment. It would anger you that your government is still not doing enough to help vulnerable people with HIV and populations that are at high risk of contracting the virus, including sexually active teenagers. It would upset you that AIDS is a leading cause of death among African Americans.\n\nIt would frustrate you that even though hundreds of thousands of HIV-positive Americans are receiving treatment in your name, more than 200,000 don’t know their HIV-positive status, largely because a lingering stigma surrounding the disease prevents them from being tested. It would disappoint you that many teenagers do not have access to science-based HIV-prevention programs in school, at a time when half of new infections are believed to be among people under 25.\n\nI miss you so very much, Ryan. I was by your side when you died at Riley Hospital. You’ve been with me every day since. You inspired me to change my life and carry on your work. Because of you, I’m still in the struggle against AIDS, 20 years later. I pledge to not rest until we achieve the compassion for which you so bravely and beautifully fought.\n\nMonths after Ryan’s death, the Ryan White CARE Act was enacted in his honour. To this day it offers support and funding to those with HIV/AIDS in the United States.\n\nIn 1992, inspired by Ryan’s story, Elton John launched the Elton John AIDS Foundation . It has since raised hundreds of millions of pounds whilst working to overcome the stigma and inequality that prevents this “ global epidemic ” from being ended.\n\nAccording to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS , 1.5 million people were newly infected with HIV in 2020, and 680’000 people died of AIDS-related illnesses in the same period.

Justin is new, and when the other kids make fun of his food and his chopsticks, Brian, a shy, lonely white boy who longs to be included by his classmates, decides to leave him a note, telling him he isn’t like those kids; he’d love to try bulgogi. Justin, whose food has not kept him from making other friends in the class, starts including Brian in activities based on this act of kindness, and all ends well, all because Brian said he’d be willing to eat bulgogi, objectively an incredibly flavorful and popular meal.\n\nAs a plot device in The Invisible Boy, the cafeteria scene works because the structure is familiar — Brian’s kindness is only noticed as kindness if the standard response is disgust. That’s because the story of that interaction has been told, in fiction, memoir, and across food media, by first-generation Americans, children of immigrants, and members of various diasporas hundreds of times. The image of a child opening their lunchbox to reveal an “ethnic” lunch and immediately being bullied for that lunch is everywhere, whether it’s Toula in My Big Fat Greek Wedding getting teased for her moussaka, Eddie Huang recalling how “no one wanted to sit with the stinky kid” when his mom sent him to school with Chinese food, or Margaret Cho joking , “All the other kids got Ho Hos and Ding Dongs. I got squid and peanuts. You can’t trade that shit.” It gained its own name around 2016, “the lunchbox moment ,” and has become the subject of endless personal essays . Even in the video launching the “new era” at Bon Appétit , editor-in-chief Dawn Davis said this anecdote was part of “every memoir” she ever published by an immigrant, and she has stated plans to launch a column around the concept of “the painful experience that was lunch.”\n\nThe lunchbox moment has become such a touchstone both because it’s recognizable for many and because it’s an editor’s dream. It cleanly illustrates, in personal essays, children’s books, or standup routines, how food that’s delicious in the context of the home becomes disgusting in public, the moment a brown child recognizes this divide, and the heartbreak of the child (usually) choosing to perform whiteness rather than get bullied again. “The odd thing was that I actually loved Chinese food, especially my mom’s cooking,” wrote Eddie Lin about his lunchbox moment. “I just wanted to fit in, like any other kid. … If it was Asian, it wasn’t cool.” And while rejecting tradition, religion, or language in favor of white, American culture is all part of that struggle, you can’t find a neater, easier-to-digest example than being told your lunch looks gross.\n\nThe story of being bullied in the cafeteria for one’s lunch is so ubiquitous that it’s attained a gloss of fictionality.\n\nThe story of being bullied in the cafeteria for one’s lunch is so ubiquitous that it’s attained a gloss of fictionality. It’s become metonymy for the entire diaspora experience; to be a young immigrant or child of immigrants is to be bullied for your lunch, and vice versa. Other food experiences have become almost as common in immigrant literature — the realization that your cuisine has become “trendy” ; the moment when a white friend tries to explain your favorite food back to you; the decision to recreate your family’s signature dish, thereby shedding the shame you’ve carried over your culture’s cuisine — and can be sources of bonding across immigrant communities. If “you can’t be what you can’t see,” an oft-repeated phrase about the importance of representation in media, then these stories are allowing more people than ever to be seen. But the “lunchbox moment” is the anecdote that’s probably the most widely employed, the background assumption at the base of these other stories.\n\nThis story, in which the bullied children age into a world clamoring for the flavors they grew up with and come to embrace the cuisine they tried to reject, is true for many. But in its retelling and fictionalization, it’s been filed down to its most obvious and recognizable parts. There is no nuance to the “lunchbox moment,” and while the trope-ification of these real-life experiences conveys trauma and discrimination to often white readers or viewers, it leaves no room for the people whose lives did not fit that template. Yes, we can’t be what we can’t see. But what are we seeing? And what do we lose when we reduce our culinary experiences to one story?\n\n“As a kid, when I started reading Asian-American stories , [the lunchbox moment] was always the part that struck me as bizarre,” said Zen Ren, who was born in China but moved with their family to Dallas when they were 3 years old. Much of that is because Ren grew up surrounded by other Asians, immigrants, and people of color. “In elementary [school] my closest friends were all Chinese American … so of course they weren’t going to make fun of our food,” they said, and as they grew up, they made other friends from different backgrounds who were accustomed to trying new cuisines. “People were curious about what I ate or didn’t notice at all.”\n\nThe lunchbox moment is a story about norms, with the assumption that the person of color is the odd one out — which it’s easy to be. According to the United States Census Bureau , 76.3 percent of Americans identify as White (with 60.1 percent identifying as both White and not Hispanic or Latino). But that doesn’t account for non-white people who grew up around others of their background, or in diverse neighborhoods where no one race is in the majority. And while most people of color have some moment of feeling othered or different, it doesn’t always happen around food, nor does it happen with the same intensity. “I absolutely never [felt shame],” said Ren. “I felt bad for my white, American friends and the boring-ass food they ate.”\n\n“I felt bad for my white, American friends and the boring-ass food they ate.”\n\nAnnu Subramanian seems like the archetypal protagonist in a lunchbox-moment story. She was born in Nebraska to Indian parents, and for about 10 years she and her parents lived in a small town in South Dakota, before moving to San Diego. “My skin is brown and my name is 21 letters long. I clearly stuck out in South Dakota,” she said. And yet, stories about children of color being belittled for their food never resonated with her, because they never resembled her experience. Her parents sent her to school with both Indian and non-Indian food, and her classmates responded to her Indian lunches with either genuine curiosity or “at worst boredom,” not derision. They even asked for it when they came over to her house. “I never ran into that ‘Indian people smell’ [stereotype],” she said.\n\nShe admits she was free to pack what she wanted for lunch, so she only brought Indian food when she was in the mood for it. “I think if I had been forced to take it, it might have been different,” she said, and it’s not as though she didn’t feel different from her peers at times. But she loved Indian food. What was more alienating were the books she read in middle school about brown people feeling embarrassment and pain around what they ate, with the assumption that this feeling was shared by all children of immigrants. “I always believed it to be universal, even though it hadn’t happened to me,” she said. “I’m still trying to find the words around it, but I became aware of the lunchbox moment as archetype, so I think I was always waiting for something like that to happen.”\n\nThe expectation that being brown or an immigrant in America inherently meant suffering and shame was frustrating to both Ren and Subramanian. “[It was alienating] as a kid because I just thought that’s how I was supposed to be and feel, because activists [and] progressives were positioned as good and insightful, and if I didn’t agree, it meant I was a bad and clueless person about my own experiences,” said Ren. They recalled reading Yell-oh Girls, a collection of essays by young Asian-American women, and feeling like none of it spoke to them. Ren was annoyed that the experiences of a certain group of Asian Americans were packaged as if they represented everybody. “I don’t know a single person in real life who felt bad about their Asian immigrant food growing up, just online stories,” they said.\n\nSubramanian recognizes it may have been unusual that her white peers responded to her family’s Indian cooking with curiosity and joy, but even if her experience wasn’t typical, it was still hard to see media that basically didn’t acknowledge her experience could exist. The lunchbox moment’s prevalence “narrows the frames we can use to tell our stories,” she said. “I would hate to see someone who doesn’t have any shame around their food see yet another story of bullying because of it, and then believe they should be ashamed!”\n\nEven for people whose lunch experiences did resemble the archetype, certain details were flattened by the trope. Krutika Mallikarjuna, who moved to the U.S. from the state of Karnataka in India as a toddler, remembers her first lunchbox moment. “I would sit down at lunch and I would open up the lunchbox, [and kids would say], ‘What is that weird goopy thing that looks like poop in your Tupperware?’” Instead of being ashamed, she was angry. “I was like, ‘How dare you? This is okra saaru. This is the most delicious meal in the world.’” However, in the interest of having a less dramatic cafeteria experience, she recognized she had to start bringing a more American lunch, which led to a different kind of lunchbox moment.\n\nBy middle school, Mallikarjuna’s mom began making her sandwiches, but sandwiches that in no way resembled anything her white friends recognized. “I’d open up my sandwich and on one slice of bread would just be plain unsalted butter, and on the other side would be orange marmalade with the skin in it, which I fucking hate,” she said. Even when her lunches consisted of “Western” food, there was something different about them. But Mallikarjuna’s sandwiches turned into a running joke with her friends, a joke inspired by love, not discrimination. After all, they all clamored for Indian snacks whenever they went to her house. “I’m sure in retrospect there was a little bit of, like, ‘Oh, she’s foreign,’ which is a little gross,” she said. “But at the same time, we were 11 or 12, so I think I can let my middle school friends slide on that.” They were clumsily curious and not at all interested in ostracizing her, and instead of being a moment of exclusion, lunch became a site of fun and connection.\n\nOthers confronted feelings of shame about their family’s food derived from media and culture, even if they found support (or indifference) among their peers. Food writer Karon Liu, whose parents moved to Toronto from Hong Kong when he was a baby, said he can’t remember anyone getting teased for their lunch in his school full of Chinese and other immigrant kids. But it didn’t take bullying to make him feel ashamed of Chinese cuisine anyway. “So much of my feelings toward food were shaped by television and pop culture,” he said. The movies and TV shows he watched positioned Chinese food as “weird,” full of “gross” ingredients and prone to making people sick. He began throwing out the lunches his parents packed him, even though many of the kids at school ate the same things, and asked them to cook him more Western food. But he still enjoyed himself at Chinese restaurants. Even with the discomfort, his relationship with Chinese food wasn’t black and white.\n\nStories about white people finding unfamiliar food off-putting, like the scene in A Christmas Story where the family is shocked and disgusted at the head on a Peking duck, and immigrants feeling shame about their food resonated with Liu as a child, but he thinks they may have limited his understanding of the breadth of the immigrant experience. During an interview, he recalls asking Elaine Lui , of Lainey Gossip, if she felt ashamed of Chinese food growing up. “I was expecting the answer where it’s like, ‘Oh, yeah, I was made fun of all the time, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.’ And then Lainey was like, ‘No, I never resented Chinese food — it’s delicious and my family made me proud of it, so no.’” Shocked, Liu realized that while his feelings of shame were very real, they were also enforced by cultural narratives implying that mortification and bullying are the only experiences an immigrant can have. “Now I’m kind of wondering if I rebuilt my childhood memories in order to fit that narrative.”\n\nIn 2016, I wrote an essay about struggle and Pizza Hut’s stuffed crust. In 1995, I was a half-white, half-Indian child living in Manhattan, with grandparents across the river in New Jersey and a taste for cheese. In the essay, I am ashamed of many things: of liking Pizza Hut (a chain, even though I was from the pizza capital of New York City), of the Indian food my grandma cooked, but also of not liking Indian food even though it was the food of my family. I wrote about the things that caused that shame, too, like seeing my classmates mocked in the cafeteria for eating “anything other than standard American food.” It painted a familiar arc to anyone who has read a personal essay by a child of immigrants — childhood frustration, navigating the space between two cultures, American prejudice, all bending toward the acceptance and unity of adulthood. And upon rereading it earlier this year, I realized a lot of it wasn’t really true.\n\nThe truth is I wasn’t ashamed of Indian food or my Indian-ness. I was curious about that part of my culture sometimes, but mostly indifferent. I was pretty content in my racial identity, the way one is content with most facts. And I never saw anyone being mocked for their lunch. It wasn’t like I was consciously lying through the process of writing the Pizza Hut essay. Instead, not being a good enough writer or deep enough thinker to identify what, exactly, had caused me such distress as a child, I resorted to illustrating my feelings with a more common narrative: the lunchbox moment. I didn’t know how to write about being a mixed-race child of immigrants in a way that didn’t involve shame or bullying, and the familiar cafeteria scene offered the structure I needed to help my story land. Regardless of whether or not it actually rang true for me, this trope felt familiar enough, and if it was true for people like me, some deep part of my brain assumed it must have been true for me as well.\n\nReading the essay now, it’s clear to me I was after a sense of belonging — and so much of belonging for people in marginalized groups has to do with shared struggle. Which sucks! We are more than that! But that common experience means being able to say, to people who share parts of your identity, that yes, the white people, the rich people, the colonizers hurt me too. Here is what they did. Here is what they said. This is when the kids bullied me for my lunch. This is when my boyfriend turned his nose at the food my parents served him. This is when they knocked on my door and told me the smells of my cooking were making them sick. And after the description of pain comes the eye-rolling, and then the laughter, the kind that says I know what you know and I’ve been where you’ve been and we.\n\nFor many, though, part of the desire to share their lunchbox moment isn’t just to commiserate with other members of the diaspora, but to tell a story that white people can sympathize with.\n\n“Belonging” doesn’t mean one thing. Beyond the imperative to fit in with one’s white American peers and their white American food, there’s the desire to belong with other immigrants, with one’s classmates, or with one’s family. For many, though, part of the desire to share their lunchbox moment isn’t just to commiserate with other members of the diaspora, but to tell a story that white people can sympathize with. In some ways, being bullied for your food is universal — who can’t relate to the feeling of being taunted for something completely outside of your control?\n\nAnd most of the time, the lunchroom drama is a story with a satisfying ending for both parties. The food in question is often now more widely beloved, so the immigrant narrator is no longer directly bullied; at the least, they’ve grown stronger and more self-assured. And white readers can pat themselves on the back, knowing they’re too open-minded to totally dismiss another culture’s cuisine. Confronting racism becomes as easy as “try new food,” and they get to be the Brian who shows Justin that not all non-immigrant Americans are so prejudiced. White people, essentially, get to be the hero.\n\nThese stories are “sellable to an editor,” Mallikarjuna says. She jokes that white editors love it when a brown person writes about their trauma, whether in a children’s book, a personal essay, or an op-ed for a food magazine. If mainstream culture continues to downplay immigrant and POC voices, when these writers do have the chance to tell a story, it has to be a clear, compelling one. Being bullied for your lunch only to grow up and find white people putting chile crisp on everything is a trajectory that’s easy to understand — and easy to sell to a white editor. What’s more, it often operates on a personal scale that makes these issues manageable. The lunchbox moment doesn’t require the reader to think about how class, religion, or caste could all change an immigrant’s experience. It doesn’t point out all the invisible ways immigrants and people of color are made to feel unwelcome. It doesn’t allow for muted or shifting feelings, or the complications of systemic racism. It’s just the hard clarity of Us v. Them, Shame v. Triumph, a white boy telling you you’re gross and a different white boy telling you he actually likes lumpia. The white gaze expects brown suffering, and even if these stories of shame and bullying are true, they can also serve to enforce that suffering. Suddenly, belonging means catering to the stories white people assume we carry.\n\nWith the Pizza Hut essay, I wanted to configure my feelings into a recognizable shape to become part of that we. Part of that is just what writing is — highlighting certain things and ignoring others, shepherding the reader to see what you want them to see. But it was so easy to guide myself into an imagined past where I felt things like shame over my heritage, fear of ridicule, and pressure to be a version of Indian I didn’t want to be. There are true things in there: my reluctance to try a lot of Indian food because I only ate it when visiting my grandparents, my frustration with the idea that any one of my identity labels was incompatible with the others, my deep love of cheese. But mostly, I gave in to the lunchbox narrative, and I didn’t notice, and of course no one else did either. Indian and non-Indian friends told me how relatable it was, because it is, because I made it into a story for other people. And in doing so, I trampled over an opportunity to expand what we could mean.\n\nWhile researching this piece, I finally experienced a sense of belonging. I felt the fluttering energy, the urge to shout “me too!” when someone names an experience, but backwards — it was the excitement over not experiencing the thing I thought was universal. And while it is incredibly important to acknowledge the suffering, there are so many more ways to connect, to belong. “A lot of this is just solved by sharing more voices, more honesty, more of the shitty experiences, and more opportunities to demonstrate pride,” said Subramanian. Our relationship with food can be shameful, but also joyful, confusing, ambivalent, and antagonistic. And there should be room for all of it, and all of us. “I never felt shame around my food and never thought to. That story should fit somewhere, too.”\n\nEmily Chu is an award winning illustrator based in Edmonton, Canada.\n\nSign up for the\n\nThe freshest news from the food world every day\n\nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\n\nBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice .

38: On Slack - Having room to be excited — Neel Nanda","link":"https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/38-slack","content":"Post 38: On Slack - Having room to be excited\n\nA few months ago, I came across a concept called Slack , and I have found this an increasingly valuable lens for understanding my life. Slack is, roughly, having spare capacity in my life. Not being pushed to my limits. Having downtime and room to explore. Being robust to small risks. Not feeling constantly stressed and anxious, having things weighing on my mind. In this post, I’m going to explore the concept of Slack, why the default state of the world is to lack slack, why this matters, and some thoughts on what to do about this.\n\nI first came across the concept in this post by Zvi, and it’s written fairly abstractly. And for good reason! I’ve struggled to articulate precisely what the concept really is. So, to see whether this resonates, here are some examples of what having Slack looks like:\n\nIf an urgent task comes up, you can reprioritise, put off your current work, and take care of it\n\nIf you’re tired and have spent the morning getting nothing done, this is fine. You can stop working early, take a long break, write the day off entirely, and get back to things tomorrow\n\nIf you come across something awesome, you can put off what you’re currently doing to take a few hours to dive deeply into it, and see what comes out of it\n\nIf you have an unexpected expense - you break something expensive, fall ill, etc - it’s not a big deal, your savings can absorb it\n\nI think Slack is an incredibly important component of having a life worth living! Having Slack gives you freedom . You have room to explore, be spontaneous and try new things. You have room to zoom out, reflect on your life, notice problems and fix them . You can take the time and energy to break out of whatever bad local optima you’re stuck in. You can relax - life always contains risks and setbacks, but you know that you’ll be able to deal with them when they arise. You can be free of constant short-term anxiety.\n\nI’m labouring this point, because the default state of the world is that your life lacks Slack . It is obvious that Slack is important when phrased like this - zoomed out, in the abstract. But Slack is defined as something you can spend . There is a delicate balance between being willing to use your Slack where appropriate, but also realising that it is a quantity worth treasuring - something to cherish, prioritise and guard.\n\nAnd there are times when it is exceptionally hard to have Slack! Due to life circumstances, like illness or money problems. By choice, eg by choosing to do an intensive job or degree for long-term reward. But I think there are also many times where Slack is spent needlessly. Where you always allocate your spare capacity away to the next priority, always trying to make your life optimal in the moment. Without noticing the bottlenecks you’re creating, and what you’re giving up. And this post is aimed at noticing ways you waste your Slack, making it clearer what you’re giving up, and seeing if it’s really worth it.\n\nDigressing somewhat from Slack, a related lens I find useful is the idea of units of exchange . We often think of our lives in terms of quantifiable resources, such as time and money. This is valuable, because we often trade-off between these two resources, by trading one for the other, and tracking resource costs can tell us whether it was a good trade! For example, often jobs are just a way to trade time and labour for money. Going the other way, we often pay money to save time. For example, I made this website with Squarespace and pay a fair bit more for that than a free alternative, but I save a lot of time due to things just working.\n\nThe idea of units of exchange is to introduce more abstract resources. Harder to quantify but important things, such as energy, willpower, sleep, focused time, attention, health, etc. Everything we do in life is a trade-off, but often we’re trading these more abstract resources too, and thinking about them can make it clear what the actual trade off is. Examples:\n\nI’d pay for an Uber home rather than taking the time to walk if late at night, but not during the day - during the day I’m trading money for time , at night I’m trading money for sleep\n\nI’d prefer to take a train to work than drive, even if it takes longer, because I can take the time on the train to read or get work done - the true trade isn’t for time , it’s for productive time\n\nI turn off all notifications when I’m working - it takes the same amount of time to respond now vs later, but the real cost is to my attention and focus\n\nThis mindset can sound obvious at first, but it’s often insightful when trying to diagnose a problem. For example, when I feel overwhelmed and stressed, the right solution depends a lot on which resource I lack! Maybe I just don’t have enough time , and can resolve this by quitting something, or being less social. Maybe I don’t have enough sleep , so I’m being extremely unproductive in the time I do have, and I can resolve this with better discipline around bedtimes and not staying up. Maybe I’m too stressed , and I really need to focus on the root cause of what’s stressing me out so I can relax more.\n\nUnits of exchange can be hard to think about, because they’re difficult to quantify - we can’t just calculate exchange rates like we can with money and time, they’re too abstract. But often this isn’t decision relevant. Often the important thing is identifying bottlenecks - the resource(s) that I spend too much of, and don’t have enough of when I need them. And this is where units of exchange help us to understand Slack better. Your Slack is constrained by your tightest bottleneck . To really have Slack, you want to have spare capacity in all of your resources - enough energy and rest to pursue your interests, enough time to spare, enough willpower and attention to keep focused, enough money to be able to relax and try things.\n\nAnd, accordingly, if you find a bottleneck, fixing this should be your priority . This is likely one of the biggest constraints on your life and your Slack. Notice where you spend it in your life, and ask whether you feel happy with this allocation. Ask yourself where you can cut back. If it’s money, look at your budget. If it’s time, think about your biggest commitments and time sinks, and think about what you least value. If it’s sleep, think about your sleep routine. If it’s willpower, think about the systems in your life. The question is not whether you can afford to give something up. You’re already giving up your Slack. The question is whether what you’d have to give up to fix it is better than what you’re already giving up. Everything is a trade-off\n\nI find it valuable at this point to think in systems . It’s easy to notice a bottleneck and resolve to Try Harder and fix it. But your resources are spent in day-to-day life, bit by bit. If there is one big fix, then that’s awesome! Eg, an unnecessary time commitment you can just quit. But often the problem is from the default actions you take. Eg, bleeding attention away every time your phone buzzes. And the only sustainable solution is to change the default .\n\nExercise : Think about the abstract resources in your life. What feels like a bottleneck? What is holding you back? What feels missing? And once you’ve found one, think about how you spend it. Is there anywhere you could cut back? Are you happy with this allocation, and the Slack it costs you?\n\nAnother failure to have Slack that I personally resonate with a lot stems from perfectionism , and a neurotic desire to “optimise” my life - what I call naive optimisation .\n\nI’m a very big fan of true optimisation - which I consider to be defining goals, identifying the actions that best achieve those goals, and shaping my life so that the default path is to take those actions. I think this is awesome, and a big component of my personal growth over the past few years. But as I talk about in this post , there’s a failure mode of naive optimisation that I find it easy to fall into. Where there’s a neurotic voice in my head that, in every moment, uses guilt and stress to push me towards whatever action seems best in the moment.\n\nAnd naive optimisation is terrible, because this inner voice is full of biases! It doesn’t account for the value of information and trying new things, that could go awesomely . It always needs to be in control, and fears vulnerability and risk. It’s a perfectionist, and holds me to unrealistically high standards . It takes energy to ignore, and is very hard to ever properly turn off.\n\nBut, for the purposes of this article this is important because naive optimisation will burn away your Slack . Slack is something to be guarded and protected to help with risks, to take opportunities, to respond to unknown unknowns. To embrace Slack is to inherently give up some aspect of control in my life. Slack is always precious, but rarely feels necessary. And so the neurotic voice in my head always wants to give it up. To be an overachiever, and take that extra course, since I obviously have time for it. To say yes to that extra commitment. To feel bad and guilty when I have time for rest, and am not pushing myself to my limits.\n\nNeedless to say, this is terrible . This mindset is a significant impediment to having an awesome and fulfilling life. Even without any true hard constraints, listening to the naive optimiser can burn away all of my Slack, without me ever realising what I’m giving up. Further, this is a bias . You fundamentally cannot trust yourself, in the moment, to properly protect and cherish your Slack, you need to have some form of manual override. Build systems to protect your Slack. Budget yourself time for things, and keep to it. Schedule yourself downtime, and make it feel sacrosanct .\n\nI find this mindset similar to the one needed to take meaningful rest . It’s never necessary to take a break. And, for any single break, I might get more done if I don’t take it! And I often won’t feel like I need rest when it’s time to take a break. But if, on a policy level, I systematically don’t take enough breaks, then I get stressed, tired, unfocused and get way less done. So I need to overcome this systematic bias, create a manual override, and make the default action to take breaks even if it feels unnecessary. And that I can’t just listen to the naive optimiser in my head if I really want to win. Just so when it comes to preserving my Slack.\n\nAnother area of my life that is extremely important to me is motivation. Specifically, the divide between intrinsic motivation - doing things because I want to, because I feel excited about them and driven - and extrinsic motivation - doing things because I have to, driving myself with guilt and obligation. And an ongoing quest is getting over the crutch of using extrinsic motivation for everything , and cultivating a life full of intrinsic motivation . Generally, I find intrinsic motivation far more fun and far more useful, but also far more fragile and easily lost, while extrinsic motivation is often easy and available, but rarely as effective as it could be.\n\nAnd this is important in the context of Slack, because when I have low Slack, I feel like I need to try hard . Things feel scarce, I can’t afford to slack off, or take enough breaks. I need to push myself, and optimise. I need to pull out all the standard, available tools of guilt, obligation, unrealistic standards. I need to be in control. My life is driven by the voice of the naive optimiser, and I fall deep into extrinsic motivation. And, even if in reality, I do have Slack, so long as the naive optimiser is in control, I’ll still be stuck on this crutch of guilt based motivation.\n\nIntrinsic motivation, on the other hand is characterised by play, curiosity and exploration. Doing something because I want to, not because I have to. This can often be far more fulfilling and far more productive, but there is an inherent lack of control here. I need to be able to zoom out and give myself the room to explore. I can’t let the inner optimiser control every last detail of what I’m doing. To have intrinsic motivation, I must first have Slack .\n\nTo me, this highlights well the notion of Slack as spare capacity , the ability to break out of bad local optima . If I’m pushing myself hard, I am stuck in a local optima. It feels wrong to stop, to slack off. Even though doing this well could give me the room to feel excited about what I’m doing, and get far more done in the long-run, I must first have enough Slack to stop and reconsider.\n\nThis is an extremely salient problem to me at the moment, because I’m spending the next 3 months trying out academic research. And research is characterised by exploration, following curiosity, trying things and seeing what works. But it’s so easy to slip into the trap of guilt and obligation, to set myself unrealistic standards, and then push myself to meet them, without really giving myself the room to enjoy what I’m doing. (Suggestions on how to address this problem in research would be very highly appreciated!)\n\nExercise: Where do you use extrinsic motivation and guilt in your life? Are you happy with this? Have you given yourself the Slack to take a step away and try another approach?\n\nI think there is an excellent utilitarian argument for the use of intrinsic motivation, and I feel confident it’s far more effective in the long-term. But this mindset feels like using extrinsic motivation to force myself to feel intrinsic motivation, which I think is doomed to failure. When aiming for an ambitious change like this, I try to imagine a future where I have achieved the change, and ask myself to explain how this happened. And I cannot imagine that change happening by thinking about how useful intrinsic motivation is, or how I really ought to feel it more often. Instead, I think the core skill for intrinsic motivation is to pursue something for its own sake .\n\nThere is a particular mindset I sometimes slip into, at the times when I do feel intrinsic motivation, that feels characteristic of a flow state. Where I’m not focused on long-term goals, and am living in the moment. Where I’m introspecting, in touch with the subtle hints of curiosity and excitement in my mind. Where I’m following this sense of curiosity and drive, pursuing whatever seems most exciting in the moment, and loving what I’m currently doing. I call this state of mind whimsy - being in touch with my emotions and my whims, in touch with what I really care, and following those where they lead. And I think that getting good at this mindset is key to a reliable source of intrinsic motivation.\n\nThis is not a mindset that comes to me particularly naturally, but the times when I have felt it have often been the most productive and more fun times I can remember. And I think this is a trainable skill - both one where I can practice slipping into the mindset, and where I can learn how to shape my life to encourage it . And it’s a skill that is extremely worth some short-term costs training, if I build it better into my life in the long-term. My ideal life wouldn’t be 100% pursuing whimsy, but it would be a fairly large long-term component.\n\nAnd this isn’t a skill that can be trained by just trying harder. The main approach I’ve found is to give myself regular space for it, and see what happens. For the last few months, I’ve been calling my Sunday afternoons my Afternoons of Whimsy , keeping them clear, and ensuring this routine feels sacrosanct - something precious that I am unwilling to give up easily. And in this time, I am not allowed to care about my long-term goals, or my various obligations. This is time carved out to introspect, find out what I feel excited about doing, and pursue it.\n\nAs I said, this is something that I struggle with, and not something that comes naturally. Sometimes I’m tired and fall into a spiral of procrastination, and do a range of un-rejuvenating things like scrolling endlessly through Reddit. Sometimes I fail to keep out my long-term goals, and end up feeling obliged to do my current highest priority and trick myself into considering it “fun”. But sometimes I feel a whim to do something fun, that I wouldn’t normally take joy in. Like going for a spontaneous run through a thunderstorm, or cleaning up my room while singing along to Disney songs. Sometimes I feel a whim to do something cool and virtuous for its own sake - like watching lectures from an online course I’m finding interesting, writing a spontaneous blog post, trying to code up something cool, or reading a textbook on something I want to understand more deeply. Maybe one in two or three afternoons I do something really awesome in hindsight. But in another sense, this isn’t the point. I don’t care about exactly what I get done - this is time I carve out where the best way to achieve my long-term goals is to not care about them. And so feeling regret about how it goes is missing the point. I feel confident that I’m slowly improving at the mindset of whimsy, and that is the best way to achieve my long-term goals\n\nIf this idea resonates with you, some tips:\n\nIf you’re feeling somewhat sold on the problem I’ve outlined, but skeptical at actually dedicating so much time to this solution, seek upside risk and try it! If it works well, this is awesome, something you can keep doing, and could significant help with a major life bug. If not, you can just give up, at the cost of a few afternoons spent doing fun things\n\nThis is an experiment in pursuit of a long-term goal, so it is something you want to do long-term! Build a system around it, and make it feel sacrosanct . I make mine Sunday afternoons, both because Sunday is a natural time for a period of rest, and because this is a regular routine, that can help me protect and cherish it.\n\nLeave yourself a long time! I find that 3 hours minimum is often necessary - I might feel a bit lazy at the start, procrastinate for a while, but then feel a whim to do something cool.\n\nTry not to plan too hard in advance - early on I found myself in the failure mode of planning what to do that afternoon in the morning, and in the moment it felt a bit stale, but I tried to push through anyway\n\nMy current approach is to go for a walk at the start and clear my head. Then to make a wish list - set a 5 minute timer , then write down anything that pops into my head that I could do, and the moment I find something that grabs me, stop writing and run with it! And if nothing seems fun, go do something else\n\nRemember, the goal isn’t to find the best thing - that’s the naive optimiser talking. You want to find something fun, and the moment something grabs you you should run with it!\n\nI find it helpful to write tasks down as “I could read …?” “I could watch …?”. It is fine if I spend this afternoon doing absolutely nothing, and writing these as wishes anchors me to doing nothing - now anything I achieve is an upside! I otherwise find it easy to slip into the mindset of writing down a long list and getting sad at what you’re missing out on by not doing everything - anchoring yourself to doing everything.\n\nBe willing to give up on things - if you aren’t enjoying what you’re doing in the moment, switch to something else!\n\nKeep in mind that it’s fine to get nothing done - don’t put pressure on yourself\n\nThe spirit of whimsy, at least for me, isn’t quite doing whatever I want. It’s about noticing and nurturing the feeling of excitement. If I feel drawn to something, focusing on why its awesome. Encouraging myself to pursue it, thinking about the upside, not about the risks and costs\n\nOverall I’ve found this a great routine to have in my life. I think rest is an important component of my life, but it’s easy for all of my rest to just be a recovery period - something I do in the evening after a day of work, when I feel tired and drained, and just want to switch off and recharge. My afternoons of whimsy are done when I have energy - where I can pursue things I actually care about. Where things still feel somewhat like work, and still take some energy, but feel fulfilling enough that I get out more energy than I put in. Where I can find the work-shaped things in my life that feel intrinsically worth doing for their own sake, and remind myself that I actually care about them.\n\nIn conclusion, Slack is an incredibly important resource! It’s a major component of my overall life happiness. If you aren’t explicitly thinking about it, the first step is just to realise that Slack is meaningful and important, and something to value, and to notice if your life lacks it. To guard and protect the Slack that you do have, and to carve out more if you don’t have enough.\n\nA necessary condition for having enough Slack is not being bottlenecked - think of your life in terms of units of exchange, and notice if anything feels missing or constraining. And if you find a bottleneck, fixing that should be a major priority! How can you shift the default of your life to better preserve that resource?\n\nA further necessary condition is to relax. To resist the call of the naive optimiser, to resist the urge to squeeze out every last drop of optimality in your life, and to realise that true optimality is this fuzzy, imprecise balance. That to truly be optimal, you can’t fully be in control, and can’t be trying as hard as possible.\n\nHaving enough Slack, and cultivating this skill is a key component of getting intrinsic motivation and drive! Which, if you’re anything like me, won’t come very naturally, but is a really important skill, and one worth putting meaningful effort into. And a way I recommend to pursue this, is to explicitly carve out time to practice having intrinsic motivation and whimsy - to do things for their own sake, to let go of outside concerns and obligations, and to follow your own sense of curiosity.\n\nAre you happy with the amount of Slack in your life? And if not, what could bring you closer to a world with more Slack? And how could you take the first step in that direction?","tokenFrequency":{"ensur":1,"idea":3,"account":1,"clean":1,"never":1,"came":2,"inform":1,"step":3,"lead":1,"two":2,"take":25,"keep":6,"articul":1,"leav":1,"timer":1,"delic":1,"aim":2,"quit":3,"slowli":1,"pressur":1,"though":1,"squeez":1,"accord":1,"real":1,"exampl":5,"fix":6,"unproduct":1,"level":1,"pull":1,"prioriti":4,"good":3,"write":7,"what":1,"sold":1,"deepli":2,"state":4,"eg":3,"recharg":1,"fail":1,"whim":4,"person":2,"still":3,"imprecis":1,"confid":2,"highest":1,"hindsight":1,"unknown":2,"larg":1,"signific":2,"urg":1,"i'v":5,"recoveri":1,"cherish":3,"guard":3,"unit":5,"afternoon":8,"track":1,"save":3,"highlight":1,"come":7,"true":4,"optima":3,"sometim":5,"optim":4,"meaning":3,"approach":3,"longrun":1,"give":17,"ideal":1,"carv":4,"worth":6,"given":1,"relev":1,"anxious":1,"reson":3,"budget":2,"harder":3,"morn":2,"term":2,"salient":1,"focus":6,"point":4,"dive":1,"root":1,"without":4,"run":3,"health":1,"reprioritis":1,"onlin":1,"help":5,"needless":2,"terribl":2,"let":2,"phone":1,"first":6,"alway":6,"head":5,"unnecessari":2,"doom":1,"voic":4,"play":1,"sacrosanct":3,"sing":1,"anywher":1,"said":1,"home":1,"setback":1,"default":7,"divid":1,"fuzzi":1,"import":11,"“fun”":1,"downtim":2,"except":1,"live":3,"ago":1,"mayb":4,"possibl":1,"aris":1,"long":4,"advanc":1,"afford":2,"unrejuven":1,"look":2,"i'll":1,"yes":1,"cut":2,"happi":5,"along":1,"joy":1,"late":1,"month":3,"it":20,"exercis":2,"crutch":2,"labour":2,"exchang":6,"address":1,"think":23,"quantifi":3,"squarespac":1,"uber":1,"key":2,"choos":1,"small":1,"overwhelm":1,"fun":6,"clear":3,"dedic":1,"closer":1,"like":15,"urgent":1,"ought":1,"natur":4,"social":1,"etc":2,"song":1,"creat":2,"otherwis":1,"experi":1,"vulner":1,"deep":1,"product":3,"allow":1,"understand":3,"could":10,"sustain":1,"lost":1,"far":7,"guilti":1,"learn":1,"pay":3,"away":5,"drive":4,"plan":2,"realli":10,"precious":2,"task":2,"imagin":2,"fan":1,"respond":2,"identifi":2,"realiti":1,"detail":1,"miss":4,"circumst":1,"awesom":8,"bring":1,"seek":1,"normal":1,"stop":4,"hold":2,"utilitarian":1,"drawn":1,"sleep":5,"job":2,"actual":4,"year":1,"caus":1,"improv":1,"attent":4,"chang":4,"protect":5,"post":6,"characteris":2,"mind":4,"relax":4,"grab":2,"major":3,"extrem":4,"form":1,"tightest":1,"found":5,"meet":1,"flow":1,"tradeoff":3,"decis":1,"unrealist":3,"embrac":1,"depend":1,"cannot":2,"we'r":1,"scarc":1,"anyway":1,"sunday":3,"consid":2,"that":2,"rest":7,"clearer":1,"achiev":5,"earli":2,"local":3,"amount":2,"moment":11,"fragil":1,"doesn't":1,"daytoday":1,"diagnos":1,"excel":1,"tire":4,"use":9,"willpow":3,"limit":2,"specif":1,"much":2,"path":1,"isn't":6,"ambiti":1,"you'r":12,"constrain":2,"burn":2,"last":3,"reflect":1,"sake":4,"someth":28,"room":8,"spirit":1,"38":1,"cool":3,"disney":1,"similar":1,"seem":3,"past":1,"start":2,"control":7,"felt":2,"wast":1,"rough":1,"100":1,"across":3,"growth":1,"sinc":1,"deal":2,"code":1,"list":2,"base":1,"reliabl":1,"unwil":1,"motiv":21,"anxieti":1,"appropri":1,"fair":3,"abil":1,"prefer":1,"system":4,"thought":1,"money":9,"will":2,"recommend":1,"less":2,"fulli":1,"work":10,"academ":1,"reason":1,"extra":2,"question":2,"reward":1,"high":2,"":124,"you'd":1,"inher":2,"problem":7,"exact":1,"blog":1,"struggl":2,"everi":4,"sink":1,"zvi":1,"shape":2,"must":2,"ever":2,"stem":1,"reddit":1,"constraint":2,"quantiti":1,"you'll":1,"put":5,"drain":1,"pursu":8,"might":2,"mine":1,"everyth":5,"practic":2,"altern":1,"current":5,"slack":47,"valuabl":3,"stale":1,"opportun":1,"right":1,"regret":1,"enough":14,"set":2,"i'm":21,"goe":1,"spare":5,"extrins":6,"win":1,"ignor":1,"upsid":3,"cost":6,"shortterm":2,"failur":4,"biggest":2,"capac":4,"phrase":1,"perfection":1,"proper":2,"somewhat":3,"anyth":4,"encourag":2,"bias":3,"overcom":1,"switch":2,"standard":4,"explor":6,"day":4,"“optimise”":1,"relat":1,"rare":2,"condit":2,"general":1,"difficult":1,"best":5,"whether":5,"least":2,"touch":3,"stay":1,"longterm":11,"done":8,"trick":1,"great":1,"spiral":1,"minimum":1,"follow":4,"minut":1,"need":12,"fine":3,"aren't":2,"tri":17,"resist":2,"explicit":2,"way":7,"increas":1,"around":2,"period":2,"wouldn't":2,"bit":5,"also":3,"various":1,"they'r":2,"bottleneck":8,"contain":1,"resourc":12,"perfectionist":1,"absorb":1,"area":1,"sound":1,"cultiv":2,"don't":8,"research":3,"explain":1,"alreadi":2,"want":10,"neurot":3,"one":8,"due":2,"scroll":1,"would":2,"night":2,"pop":1,"written":1,"websit":1,"outsid":1,"big":4,"emot":1,"better":5,"purpos":1,"concern":1,"outlin":1,"futur":1,"hour":2,"weigh":1,"abstract":6,"walk":2,"tip":1,"routin":4,"alloc":3,"world":3,"bad":3,"unexpect":1,"time":36,"action":5,"full":2,"life":35,"balanc":2,"sens":3,"trainabl":1,"see":5,"drop":1,"skeptic":1,"push":7,"interest":2,"obvious":3,"even":6,"overal":2,"articl":1,"wish":2,"matter":1,"digress":1,"slip":4,"zoom":3,"curios":5,"forc":1,"appreci":1,"tomorrow":1,"virtuous":1,"anchor":2,"necessari":5,"later":1,"train":4,"schedul":1,"fundament":1,"longer":1,"freedom":1,"there":2,"oblig":6,"ongo":1,"enjoy":2,"textbook":1,"lack":5,"toward":1

Economy\n\nThis is an excerpt from ReCulturing: Design Your Company Culture to Connect with Strategy and Purpose for Lasting Success by Melissa Daimler (McGraw Hill, May 2022) .\n\nDaimler is currently the Chief Learning Officer at Udemy, and she previously was a leader at WeWork, Twitter, and Adobe, as well as running her own boutique advisory and coaching business.\n\nIn this excerpt, Daimler details how company culture comes to life through a series of actions, or practices, that must evolve with the company; examples of when practices did not evolve (WeWork) and when they did (Twitter); and then dives deep into one of the most critical areas for how a culture is practiced, communication, sharing frameworks for intentionally designing how companies communicate.\n\n“What worked yesterday is the gilded cage of tomorrow.”— Peter Block\n\nWhen thinking about the practice of culture, I sometimes refer to a fable about the “Pot Roast Principle”—the tradition of cutting off the ends of the pot roast that was passed down to the next generation. When a granddaughter finally asked her grandmother how the tradition started, she discovered that the real reason was because the pot roast would not fit into her grandmother’s small roasting pan unless the ends were cut off.\n\nThis is how traditions and practices get passed down. We watch, we learn, we do, without asking questions. When a company is young, implicit assumptions are made on how to do things, the wrong behaviors can get reinforced, and the ends get cut from the roast, even when the pan is bigger. Practices need to be reviewed and evolve with the company; if not, different behaviors get reinforced.\n\nHere is an example: when WeWork was founded in 2010, the company instituted a mandatory practice of bringing employees together during a three-day Annual Summer Camp. As the company grew, this practice remained. Many employees looked forward to the event every year, giving them opportunities to connect with colleagues and build a community with each other. Others had more mixed feelings. One of WeWork’s values was “together,” and this was a practice that the cofounders and a core group of leaders thought to be an expression of that. And that may have been true when the company had 10 employees, maybe even 100, but by 2017, at 4,000 employees, “Summer Camp” got complicated. There were concerns from employees about the appropriateness of spending three nights in a teepee with their colleagues in a field an hour and a half outside of London. Security and HR concerns aside, the practice, given the size and scope of the company, became quickly outdated.\n\nCould WeWork have retained the essence of the connection it sought through the Summer Camp, but in a different way that appealed to more employees? In reviewing its practices, WeWork could have investigated the practices of other companies that grew too large to have one global event. If they had, they might have been inspired to have smaller, local team events that didn’t include tents, overnight stays, or even alcohol, keeping the focus on connection and community and less on managing the omnipresent discomfort and stress.\n\nPractices are the informal, day-to-day, and sometimes more functionally oriented actions or rituals that employees and teams implement. The five core practices most companies perform on a consistent basis are communicating, meeting, learning, recognizing, and connecting.\n\nJust like we can design intentional processes that align with and reinforce culture, we can do the same with our practices. Company strategies evolve, our processes evolve, leaders evolve. Our practices must evolve too.\n\nAs illustrated by the WeWork example, one of the mistakes many growing companies make is keeping the same processes and practices they used when they had 20 employees, even though their company has grown to 500, 1,000, or even 3,000 employees. Fortunately, it is possible to keep the essence of what that practice intended to do—mostly building team camaraderie, community, and connection—while also evolving the practice to ensure it continues to be inclusive and scalable.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times , Matthew Prince, CEO of the cyber security firm Cloudflare, said that it is important to review practices as the company grows, with an eye on those that can exclude others. In fact, one of the dangers of growing “too quickly” is not evolving practices in a manner that is relevant to the changes accompanying the growth. Prince shared an example about a younger engineer suggesting a weekly practice of getting drinks at a local pub every Friday to talk about the week and get to know each other. Prince vetoed the idea because it wasn’t suitable for all people and all lifestyles. Could this practice, which might be a welcome one for a fresh MBA graduate who is single, translate to the schedule and responsibilities of a single parent or team member who has to commute farther to get home?\n\nPrince shared: “I explained that when you look at successful organizations, they’re defined by their ability to pull from the broadest possible pool of people. At some point, we’re going to want to hire a 50-year-old single mom or dad who has to pick up their daughter from soccer practice on Friday afternoons. If they can’t feel like they’re part of the team, then they’re not going to come work for us. That’s going to massively narrow the pool of people we can hire from. We wanted to make Cloudflare a place where, no matter who you were, you could come here and work, and you’d be judged on that work. We weren’t trying to recreate college.”\n\nAt Twitter, when everyone worked in the same office location, Friday afternoon happy hours were nice. They were called “Tea Time,” and started when all the employees could fit on a sofa and a few comfy chairs, grabbed a beer or “tea,” and talked about the week. What happened? What did we learn? What is not working? What is happening next week?\n\nAs the company grew beyond its San Francisco headquarters into other global locations, then numbering over 1,500 employees, Tea Time had to be rethought to accommodate new geographies. Friday afternoon is late in London and already the weekend in Tokyo. Twitter moved to alternating the time between evenings and mornings with different sites hosting. Each host would highlight business updates on a local level, sharing local cultural practices and team updates, all centered around the company’s values. Doing so helped all employees feel like they were contributing to the purpose, strategy, and culture of Twitter.\n\nIn my book, ReCulturing , Patty McCord – Netflix’s former chief talent officer and now human resources consultant – and I discussed the pull to hang on to practices and ways of working, even if they weren’t exactly working great before. “Beware of the smoke of nostalgia,” she said. Instead of asking, “Remember how it used to be?” think about how great it can be now. She reminded me that the infamous culture deck she co-created at Netflix was not created overnight, or even in a year. It was created over 10 years.\n\nEvolving practices has become even more important with remote work. There are not as many social cues as there were in the physical workplace. Often, some of the most important work used to get done in the hallways in between meetings. Companies are now having to adjust more quickly to working remotely with the help of intentionally evolving their practices that reinforce the culture. For example, those once-a-month all-company meetings might move to a weekly cadence. Those team meetings that lasted an hour each week are now twice a week for 30 minutes. That pat on the back is now a comment on the company’s communication platform.\n\nLike meetings, communication mechanisms are often not considered as intentional practices that need to be designed and evolved. Synchronous communication (one-on-ones with direct reports, peers, or your manager), team meetings, and all-hands meetings, as well as asynchronous communication (texts, emails, Slack messages, and yes, even phone calls) all need continued review. But first, a story.\n\nA few years ago, I was stuck in New York’s JFK Terminal 4 trying to get back to San Francisco (yes, another airport story—I traveled a lot). My fellow passengers and I were standing in our designated lines at our departure gate, ready to board. The boarding time had come and gone. After 20 minutes with no updates, people lined up to talk to the gate agent behind the desk. But the agent didn’t talk to anyone—he was too busy talking on the phone. He seemed scattered, frustrated, and even angry. Then, he abruptly put on his jacket and left the desk without saying anything. The passengers started talking, making up the worst possible scenarios, looking at our phones, trying to figure out what was going on and what our action plan was. Was the flight canceled? Were we going to get home tonight to see our families? Should we look into booking a hotel for the night? Was it even safe to take this flight if it opened again? The collective anxiety was palpable.\n\nAs we were comparing our imagined scenarios with each other (and these are usually worse than reality), a woman named Diane confidently, intentionally, and even happily, walked behind the desk. She put her bag down and, before even taking off her jacket, got on the loudspeaker and told us, with a smile on her face, that she had no idea what was going on, but she would get back to us with an update within the next 20 minutes. There was a collective sigh of relief. While we still had no information, we had candor and a promise. We all calmed down knowing someone was now communicating with us.\n\nAnd communicate with us Diane did—every 20 minutes. First update: “OK, I just heard from the captain. He said we have a flat tire—yes, planes get flat tires, too—and they were working on getting a new one. The good news is that there are no engine issues, so this won’t take as long as we had thought.” Second update: “OK, no new updates here, but I do have bottled water for everyone if you want one.” Third update: “Still no update, everyone. I am talking to the captain soon.” Fourth update: “OK, we got the tire! Still working on the timing of how long it will take to get on.” Fifth update: “The tire is on, and we should be ready to board by my next update.” Final update: “OK! Let’s board!” This took about two hours.\n\nWhen I work with leaders on how to communicate important updates, I often think about Diane. While leaders are dealing with more than a flat tire on an airplane, the takeaway is to over-communicate, even if we don’t have all of the answers. One of my mentors used to tell me that if I felt like I was communicating too much, that probably meant that I was communicating just enough.\n\nOne of my clients, Bonnie, was feeling the same way that first man behind the boarding gate counter was feeling. She was getting feedback that her team needed to hear more from her in the first few weeks of the global pandemic, when everyone was sheltering in place.\n\nBonnie is a CEO of a fast-growing startup. She is an experienced leader. She had already worked with her current leadership team in building out a clear strategy, defining their values, behaviors, processes, and practices. So, ensuring everyone was safe and set up to work from home was just another process for her and her team. She gave updates on the business in the first all-company virtual meeting. Everyone seemed like they were coping well, considering the circumstances.\n\nYet, during one of our coaching sessions, in the third month of the pandemic with all of her employees working from home, she shared that she had not sent anything out to the team for several weeks. She was already overwhelmed with too much news, advice, and conflicting theories on what was happening in the world. She didn’t want to burden her employees with more of the same uncertainty. What more was there to say? Well, a lot.\n\nWhile everyone was getting inundated with too much information externally, they craved more information from her as the CEO. They didn’t expect, want, or need answers. They just wanted a consistent connection with their leader. When we referred to her company’s values and behaviors, one of those behaviors had to do with ongoing connection. Since everyone had started working at home, she hadn’t ReCultured to identify different processes and practices to put in place that would exemplify that behavior.\n\nBonnie began a practice of daily 10-minute virtual stand-ups with her leadership team. She asked each leader to do the same with their teams. She had a virtual all-hands meeting every Friday (up from once a month). Bonnie participates in various group Slack channels and holds open office hours each week. She continues these practices today.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article pointed out that “Crises teach us that CEOs (and leaders) aren’t expected to be as right as they are expected to be engaged.” Leaders often don’t communicate because they don’t think they have any valuable information to share. Yet, good communication is about more than updates. It’s about connection.\n\nAs more and more companies are shifting to a hybrid workplace, communication becomes an even more important, active practice when not everyone is physically in the same place. We need communication, but we need to still be intentional about the kind of communication we’re sharing and how we’re sharing it.\n\nCal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University, writes about the importance of deep work and focus. He writes in his latest book, A World Without Email, that “modern knowledge workers communicate constantly. Their days are defined by a relentless barrage of incoming messages and back-and-forth digital conversations—a state of constant, anxious chatter in which nobody can disconnect, and so nobody has the cognitive bandwidth to perform substantive work.”\n\nNewport includes staggering statistics: The average office worker gets and receives 126 emails a day, and the average worker puts in only 75 minutes of uninterrupted work daily. Teams that work through asynchronous communication practices and answer the suggested questions will allow their members to focus more on deep work—maybe even get longer than 75 minutes a day of uninterrupted work. As a result, teams will feel more productive and experience a more meaningful connection to each other and the organization.\n\nWhen major shifts happen, either externally or internally at your organization, that’s a sign to ReCulture. Slack, Microsoft Teams, email, text, Google Docs, chats, phone calls, and video calls are all available communication options. Be clear with your team about how to use these tools and the expectations around them. For example, Slack and text are more urgent than email. Do you even need to send that email? Could it go into a Google Doc that you review with someone at another time when you’re both meeting already? In 2005, researchers from the University of California studied context switching and the impact it had on productivity. They found that people could take more than 20 minutes to get back to a task after they were interrupted.\n\nI used to send my team Harvard Business Review articles. Sometimes I would send them research reports that I found fascinating. Some of them would be over 50 pages. I would skim them and come up with so many good ideas that we could possibly do with our team that I wanted to pass them along to the team.\n\nAfter a few months of this, one of my team members shared in a one-on-one that she couldn’t keep up with all the articles I was emailing. She said the rest of the team is also feeling overwhelmed by how much I expected them to review. Overwhelmed? Review? In my mind, the articles were just FYI. If they wanted to read them and they were useful to them to spark ideas, great. But no big deal if not. I was not clear in my communication. So, as a team, we created new communication practices by being clear what we needed and wanted, in the time frame we wanted it, in the subject line. We came up with: FYI (for things that don’t need to be responded to but read), NAN (“No Action Needed” for things that don’t need to be responded to or read), URGENT: if needed within 24 hours (could also be followed up with a text); and AN (“Action Needed” for things that needed a response within the next 48 hours). This helped all of us prioritize our communications and next actions. We even came up with a practice of highlighting the top three takeaways from an article if we shared it with the rest of the team.\n\nMelissa Daimler is the Chief Learning Officer at Udemy, an online learning platform.

\u0026 the death of staking - Cobie","link":"https://cobie.substack.com/p/apecoin-and-the-death-of-staking?s=r","content":"ApeCoin \u0026 the death of staking\n\nRecently, I was contacted by a member of the board of ApeCoin, which is the BAYC token’s equivalent of a board of directors I guess. They asked for some feedback on some proposal and I offered my thoughts on a call.\n\nI wanted to write about some of the things discussed openly, since I thought they were interesting topics, but particularly because they were topics that “coin voting governance” is extremely poorly suited to properly solving.\n\nBefore I start: I don’t own any ApeCoin, nor am I short ApeCoin, I have owned BAYC at times in the past but don’t have any long or short exposure to any Yuga Labs ecosystem stuff currently. I’m not a financial advisor and it has in fact been long rumoured that I am actually an idiot.\n\nStaking used to mean something. I think it was Peercoin that first launched a proof of stake protocol, so probably about ten years ago now. Since then, POS has become increasingly popular for new blockchains, with all the newer trendy ecosystems sitting on POS-ish chains.\n\nFor Peercoin and the POS networks that followed, staking had a purpose. Owners would offer their coins as collateral for the chance to validate blocks, and they would be rewarded for doing so. Staking, therefore, rewarded users risking collateral and doing work: participating in functions necessary to the continued operation of the network or protocol.\n\nSomehow, over time, the word ‘staking’ has been repurposed and redefined. Instead of receiving rewards for contributing to chain security with collateral at stake, modern “staking” just seems to mean idk we give you more coins as a reward if you don’t sell your current coins lol.\n\nThese modern staking mechanisms do not have any function in the ecosystem to which they belong. They don’t do anything in any practical or technical sense. They don’t make an ecosystem more robust. They are a shell game, using the name of a different thing to obfuscate their actual purpose, which is to encourage less selling.\n\nWhen POS protocols issue rewards to stakers, they are buying chain security. It’s a worthwhile use of equity. When DeFi projects offer liquidity mining programs, they are buying growth and TVL. Depending on how the program is designed, it can also be a worthwhile use of equity. Spending equity for things that makes the protocol more sustainable, larger or more secure seems worthwhile.\n\nBut these “staking” mechanisms (that do not do anything at all except pay users more coins for staking) are giving away equity for nothing except to reduce potential sellers’ liquidity.\n\nIf you don’t stake, your share of the network or protocol is inflated away by new emissions. Plus, staking has no risk! You can’t lose coins, because staking doesn’t do anything! So, lock up your coins! Secure them off-market today… In fact, we’ll pay you to do it!\n\nSimply paying users for not selling, payment received in the same asset that they are not selling, seems like pretty late-stage in the games of ponzi creation.\n\nThere’s 1bn supply. No new coins can be minted or burned, so the total suppy will always be 1 billion APE.\n\nToken ownership looks like this:\n\nOn the vesting side, it looks like generally there’s a one year lockup for Yuga Labs, Founders and Investors — but it does seem like there’s some exceptions to that, with some coins unlocked instantly and some after 6 months.\n\nThe remaining vesting schedule seems to range between 1 and 3 years after the cliff, with the entire supply 100% unlocked within 4 years.\n\nAnyway. Back to the point.\n\nThere is a proposal live for a staking program for ApeCoin. It’s written by Animoca which seems to be some hybrid crypto gaming VC software company, and their founder is on the board of ApeCoin.\n\nIn the proposal author’s words, the goal of this proposal is: to make ApeCoin the preferred token of web3 by incentivizing early NFT adopters and existing and potential ecosystem participants to be participate in activities benefitting the APE Ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal itself seems pretty convoluted but I can summarize it for you. The proposal basically says:\n\nWe should pay 17.5% of the total supply of ApeCoin to people that stake their ApeCoin over the next three years. We should give them different % returns if they hold BAYC/MAYC/BAKC as well.\n\nIt’s not clear to me how issuing APE to people that already have APE is “incentivizing early NFT adopters and existing and potential ecosystem participants to be participate in activities benefitting the APE Ecosystem”.\n\nIsn’t it just paying people in ApeCoin to hold ApeCoin?\n\nIn fact, if we are being truly honest about this proposal, what it really means is “lets pay existing holders for not selling while the founder/investor/contributor unlocks happen, and also so we can fake some utility before any is actually built”.\n\nThe current valuation of ApeCoin is around 15 billion dollars. That means the DAO treasury holds around 7 billion dollars.\n\nAnimoca’s proposal suggests giving away $2.6 billion dollars (~37% of the DAO’s remaining tokens) for free to holders of APE over the next three years.\n\nSince this APE staking doesn’t actually do anything practically or technically, it can be imagined simply as a bribe to not sell. It says “we’ll give you more APE if you don’t sell your APE or BAYC!”\n\nThe DAO is spending 37% of it’s remaining equity on this bribe, so it must consider the bribe important.\n\nConsider that this equity could be spent on a lot of things: it’s currently valued at 2.6 billion dollars! Lots of value could be created for ApeCoin that could build a sustainable ecosystem as well as attract new, external capital.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, it might appear that the DAO is spending over 1/3rd of it’s remaining equity in order to bribe people not to sell while the early contributor coins pass their early unlock phases.\n\nBut this seems more conspiracy-theory-like than a practical malicious strategy when you consider the supply/demand dynamic that will follow from this staking program.\n\nThere is currently ~15% of the supply liquid on the market. This inflation/emissions schedule will increase the amount of supply on the market by ~75% in only the first year. And yet I don’t believe that it will increase the demand for ApeCoin by 75%. Thus, the staking program in isolation could appear harmful to the financial interests of the locked-coin holding insiders.\n\nBut, ApeCoin does have a real problem: how does it get additional supply into the market so that impending founder and investor unlocks do not become the lion’s share of the liquid supply?\n\nI personally believe it is good to spend this earmarked equity, but the equity should be spent on growth and progress towards their originally stated goal: becoming the currency of web3. It shouldn’t be spent just giving coins to people that already hold coins.\n\nApeCoin DAO’s remaining equity should be spent solving real problems for users.\n\nI don’t know what it means to fulfill the mission of “becoming the main currency for web3” but I do know that there are existing ‘user needs’ within the NFT ecosystem that could be funded or built by ApeCoin DAO.\n\nWhy is OpenSea the primary exchange for Bored Apes? BAYC and MAYC traders have spent ~20,000 ETH on OpenSea fees in the last year. That’s \u003e$60m leaving the ecosystem every year.\n\nBAYC holders, or NFT holders generally, may want to obtain a line of credit on their NFT while retaining ownership. Can ApeCoin DAO create the primary NFT lending marketplace?\n\nWhy do Bored Ape users keep getting hacked? What educational resources are needed to help people self-custody more effectively? Could ApeCoin DAO launch an attractive custody service?\n\netc etc. I am sure the community can think of better ones than me.\n\nThe DAO’s equity should go towards building incremental value for APE ecosystem users and potential users. It should solve real problems that exist for users within the NFT community.\n\nThe equity should be spent acquiring and incubating utility, building revenue streams and creating a sustainable DAO.\n\nI think there’s a reasonable argument that 15% ‘retail’ ownership is too small, and a staking program in the first year or so (while the only supply eligible for staking is retail) can increase that to more meaningful levels.\n\nI can also see an argument for a 10-15 year emissions program: the APE token has no mint function, and cannot increase it’s own supply. If the DAO spends all of the APE in the first few years, it will have no more firepower to incentivise activity or acquire future value. Plus, you will achieve a wider and more desirable distribution over time by increasing the length of time someone must become an ecosystem participant. This incentivises future “generations” of holders to maintain and grow the ecosystem too.\n\nI can see an argument for why the BAYC NFTs should be the thing staked: to remove users having to choose between joining the community via buying a BAYC, or buying ApeCoin. Plus it’s maybe more likely that new people will be onboarded to the APE community through NFTs rather than fungible coins, since that is how it worked for everyone in the current APE community.\n\nI can see an argument for why the BAYC NFTs should not be the thing staked: ApeCoin is a brand new entity, founded by the BAYC community but not actually directly attached to the NFTs anymore, outside of overlapping owners.\n\nIn reality, these arguments are not grounded in much reality, because it is difficult to say: what is the point of this staking program? What is the program trying to achieve?\n\nThe proposal says some nonsense about “incentivising participants to do stuff in the APE ecosystem” but the staking proposal itself appears detached from that goal.\n\nIf ApeCoin DAO wants the staking program’s goal to be to acquire new members for the DAO , then a credible staking program might include issuing ongoing rewards to NFT holders within the APE ecosystem. The APE ecosystem might even acquire other NFT collections and issue APE to these communities too.\n\nIf the staking program’s goal was to support the liquidity of the BAYC ecosystem, then APE emissions would be issued to those providing LP in APE/WETH markets, as well as those providing liquidity to NFTX-style pools and otherwise.\n\nIf the staking program’s goal was to simply pump prices, then it would require time-locking assets off market, giving higher rewards for longer time-period locks and strangling supply off-market for as long as possible.\n\nWithout the stated goal from the ApeCoin board on what is the purpose of a staking program then it’s difficult to design a staking program that fulfils those goals. Getting more supply onto the market, bribing users to not sell, or providing “fake utility” are not credible goals for a staking program.\n\nPersonally, I would design a small program that incentivises introducing increasing amounts of new people to the Ape ecosystem over the next decade, and I would reward existing holders for their continued participation in the ecosystem. It is my personal belief that new users will be onboarded for the NFTs, rather than fungible assets, and thus rewards should be paid to the NFT asset holders rather than a fungible coin paying effectively an interest rate for holding it.\n\nI would supplement this staking program with an aggressive, and much larger, program of purchasing value.\n\nA multi-billion dollar organisation, which ApeCoin now is, needs to have a sufficiently long time-horizoned plan. There should be a good answer to the question: how do we turn this $7 billion of APE-denominated treasury assets into $100 billion of value over the next decade or two?\n\nYet the time horizon for crypto investors is not always very long. On average I imagine they don’t care much about what their token projects will be doing in 2 months, nevermind 10 years.\n\nThus, if you tell the community “hey, we decided there will be no staking program, and we are going to invest growth by paying builders to contribute to the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem” they will likely be very unhappy.\n\nI don’t get any coins for free anymore?? And outsiders get millions of dollars of coins?? Just for building a lending market?? Wtf???\n\nIt’s unlikely retail investors rigourously consider the implications of Ohm-style supply inflation to existing holders, nor have they considered the k-factor knock-on effects of investor trust from seeing a price chart go down (even if the staking emissions meant holders are actually up overall).\n\nThus, governance over complex and multifaceted analytical issues is a strange environment. It quickly descends into politics.\n\nI have extremely little faith that coin-voting communities of retail investors will vote for the best medium-term outcomes, and in fact will more likely vote for damaging medium-term outcomes. I read something today that said Sushi treasury went from $1bn to $30m in a year. I don’t know if that is exaggerated, or fictional, but think this will be a common story of many failed DAOs in time.\n\nStaking mechanisms should be designed to support the goals of the ecosystem. They should be used to incentivise the parts of a product, community or network that requires people to do work or to take risk.\n\nApeCoin DAO has 7 billion dollars in it’s treasury. It should use it to incentivise people to take risks, do work, and grow the community — rather than giving it away to existing holders as an interest rate bribe for not selling.\n\nWithout utility or value capture, spending 37% of the treasury on staking emissions is not only worthless but could actually be actively harmful to the APE ecosystem’s long-term prospects.\n\nWe should’ve protested the repurposing of the term “staking” from being a reward for work in a consensus mechanism, with risk of losing collateral, into this current “idk just lock it off market to receive more coins risk-free lol” but it’s probably too late for that now. I imagine the Gensler-police are very pleased that the conflation has occurred, since the term is now inherently misleading and can mean several different things.\n\nI really hope we don’t live in a world where the primary currency of the internet is called “ApeCoin” but I hope that I managed to keep that glaring bias out of this article and that this is relevant for any DAO finding itself in a similar position: lots of capital, good distribution and the opportunity to land-grab utility.\n\nThe Bored Ape community is famous in crypto for continually failing at secure self-custody.\n\nIn response, the ApeCoin board has suggested this that BAYC NFTs will actually ‘contain’ your APE tokens.\n\nIf a BAYC ecosystem NFT holder wants to stake in pool 2, 3, or 4 (depending on the NFT), they will pair the NFT with their ApeCoin to access the relevant staking pool. The NFT itself isn’t staked — it acts as the key to the “vault” holding the staked ApeCoin. The NFT holder retains the ability to sell the NFT. By default, if you sell an NFT that is actively staking ApeCoin, you are also selling the key to access the associated staked ApeCoin.\n\nTo sell the NFT only, without the associated staked ApeCoin, the NFT seller would unstake the ApeCoin prior to listing the NFT.\n\nThis means, if you lose your BAYC, you lose your APE too!\n\nYou cannot spread your NFT and your APE coins into different wallets. It means if someone steals your BAYC, they don’t have to do anything extra to take your APE. The APE goes with the BAYC by default! Great!\n\nIt seems intentionally convoluted, and incurs more bad outcomes than good ones. Even forgetting that you had staked APE behind a particular NFT could be a huge financial error. Really bad design.\n\nThe ApeCoin board has also issued this statement:\n\nWe believe that everyone in web3 should have control of their assets. In order to provide NFT owners this right, the NFTs themselves will not be staked into the staking pools. Furthermore, by staking ApeCoin rather than the NFTs, the ApeCoin DAO incentivizes and fosters the long-term growth of the ApeCoin holder community.\n\nThis seems like straight-up double-speak. Everyone should control their assets, so you can’t put this asset into the contract. But you can put these other assets into the contract!\n\nIt actually makes so little sense that I can only conclude it’s treating users as dumb.\n\nThe market cap of APE is larger than BAYC, so it’s likely that more assets would be in the contract if it is APE-only staking than if it were BAYC-only staking!\n\nAnyway, what happens after three years of staking?\n\nWhat happens at the end of the three-year period of staking?\n\nA new AIP will need to be drafted and voted on to determine the future staking mechanism, putting this decision in the hands of the community. Ideally, by the end of the total staking period of 3 years, the DAO will have sustained revenue to keep incentivizing staking and rewarding ecosystem participants.\n\n“Ideally”??? Surely it would be preferable to establish the revenue plans prior to the staking program, then? What if a credible plan for comparable revenue takes 5 years instead of 3? Designing a staking program without understanding a product and revenue plan that it is subsidising in the first place also seems pretty wild.\n\nNot that it matters much anyway, because staking in this scenario doesn’t do anything, it is just a bribe to remain a community member.\n\nOh also the current staking proposal includes $1.3bn of emissions in the next year (at current prices). This alone would create $700m of sell pressure from new tax obligations alone, assuming all holders were in a reasonably ‘western’ high-tax regime. Pretty cool.\n\nThis site requires JavaScript to run correctly.

a witch: crypto coven art generator overview — Crypto Coven","link":"https://cryptocoven.mirror.xyz/GoWMQ-RQkR5-j0CLtXitqRvmL8oqqq0OY0HcM1til9U","content":"forging a witch: crypto coven art generator overview\n\nHello! ✨ I am Nyx, Witch of Woe for Crypto Coven. I conjure visions for the weird wilds through tone and concept, am one of our dual artists with Aletheia, and delicately weave layers of logic in code for the coven.\n\nToday I’d like to speak to our generator and how a WITCH is forged.\n\nOur generator is responsible for two parts of your witch’s creation:\n\nTo begin, some background context on ERC-721s and what that inscrutable .json file contains:\n\n(If you would like to skip to the more creative code, feel free to hop below!)\n\nThe final form of a witch is an ERC-721 token, stored on the Ethereum mainnet. As a construct, they are quite simple—a token with an owner and a pointer to an amorphous blob of metadata. ERC-721s are called “non-fungible,” since the abstraction is used to attest that each witch is unique and may not be equivalently exchanged for any other.\n\nA US dollar or a bottle of perfume still in its package is, by contrast, fungible and can be swapped for another of the same kind interchangeably.\n\nWitches associated with a non-fungible tokens (NFT), allow their owner to take them to any web3 destination that may welcome a WITCH. It is stored in your wallet where you alone have custody, rather than a centralized database that may only be accessible through a single platform (like your Fallout 3 character, or an instagram post).\n\nA witch’s metadata takes the following shape, complying to a loose standard for NFTs in general , augmented by recommendations from OpenSea to help standardize their marketplace.\n\nInside the attributes array, we define aspects that are custom to the project and not shared by the overall NFT standard (physical traits, attunements, horoscopes, etc.). The shape of these objects are arbitrary—we followed a standard that lets marketplaces create filters for the collection, so you could find a Taurus enchantress with pink hair if you like.\n\nOnce a witch is constructed—name, archetype, articulation, astrological chart, physical aspects, and final image—our generator uploads all of the above to ipfs , a decentralized file storage system similar to a peer-to-peer torrent network.\n\nWe pay Pinata to “pin” our metadata .json files there so that they are distributed across the network and are not subject to garbage collection if they are not accessed for a while. Our smart contract points to the individual metadata files on ipfs , and thus a witch is stored and rendered persistently.\n\nThe final images of the witches themselves are hosted on s3 —we wanted them to load quickly when a witch desired them, even at large sizes. The caching and infrastructure of a more mature platform lends itself well to that. The images are also easily backed up in case the centralized entity disappears and can be restored using the metadata if all else fails.\n\nConstructing a witch, however, has little to do with how it is stored. It’s similar to coding a doll-maker, the ancient internet girl art form perfected by Dollz and Picrew .\n\nWhat was most important to us is that we had the flexibility to create a set of witches that were truly diverse—a range of body sizes, skin tones, and hair textures, where as many people as possible could find themselves in a witch. A lofty goal, made difficult to achieve by traits that by default are randomly shuffled together.\n\nWe also wanted the witches to be visually unique, not merely computationally. Especially at a large scale (such as 9,999 witches) with hand-drawn layers, it’s easy for each of the characters to blend together or feel extremely similar if there are not enough combinations. We needed to optimize for composability so we had enough variety each witch could stand on their own.\n\nThe first task of constructing the witches was to define what attributes we would need and their relationships to each other.\n\nOur very first iteration of the generator was based on hashlip’s generative-art-node , which buckets layers in the file system by attribute (eyes, mouth, hair, etc.), randomizes them, and has a simple scaffold to paint onto a javascript canvas using Node.js . It’s a great place to start for simple 2D character projects.\n\nThe setup feels similar to processing.js , which has a deep archive of excellent tutorials if you’re looking to dip your toe in generative art and would like more structure getting started. It’s helpful to have a mental model that your code paints layers on a canvas, where each canvas is a single frame in time.\n\nFor the witches, I began by creating some quick sketch layers to deliberately trigger edge cases and collisions.\n\nI think an easy trap is to create layers that look cohesively good on a single character but are not composable, limited the range of your collection. Or to avoid tricky edge cases like the purple starry skies hair that do not work well with hats until the very end, coding yourself into a corner where your abstractions are not flexible enough to accommodate them.\n\nQuickly we refined some basic rules—different parts of a hairstyle should be the same color, and witches should not roll conflicting items to wear on their head (forehead jewelry would not fit with hats).\n\nA witch with every attribute at once often looked cluttered, so we decided to flip a weighted coin to determine which layers were present and which were not.\n\nWhile isolating layers by style or parts of the body worked for most accessories, our most complicated guardrail logic revolved around hair.\n\nA simple color match often resulted in chaotic styles and limited the range we could achieve. We defined textures that were a requirement for the matching logic (straight, wavy, curly, braids, cloud) and broke hair up into even more granular layers we could compose.\n\nComposing hair became a series of array intersections. Roll for bangs, flip a coin to determine optional back, front, middle—then choose from a set of styles for each category that matched restraints for hair texture, color, body shape, and archetype.\n\nSome styles (like the dramatic swoop or cloudy skies ) were intentionally drawn with a matching bang and back, while others were made to mix and match to diversify the silhouettes in the overall collection.\n\nWe defined requirements and exclusions for certain styles and the large set of possible combinations helped the coven feel visually unique, not just computationally.\n\nFor more complex styles, we experimented with how we wanted to solve visual collisions by adding generic rulesets in the code, versus changing how the layers were structured in Photoshop.\n\nFor example, the pearl hood on the top left below chained multiple requirements when one of the pieces were rolled (the hood front required the matching hat-back , body-over , and pearl facewear ), but the pearls could be rolled alone as headwear requiring nothing else.\n\nTo achieve all ends, we defined 21 attributes (or layer types) to express the witches. We settled on a system where some attributes would deliberately exclude each other (horns could not be worn with hats), and others would always be required ( hat-backs require a hat-front ). The strict layer order is the one rule it is easiest not to circumvent in the painting code, since edge cases and bugs are already complex enough to reason about.\n\nTagging each hand-drawn style with extra metadata like hair texture, color, body size, archetype, requirements and exclusions, we soon had a witch roller that produced a ~cute~ witch for most rolls.\n\nAs Aletheia + I defined styles for particular archetypes, individual styles needed to maintain a relationship with each other and not just the broad categories of attributes.\n\nWe ended up tossing out most of the original generative-art-node structure that relied on filenames for style metadata and moved to a proper database. Xuannü devised a visually beautiful and easily modifiable table for us to upload and manage the individual styles, which allowed us to break out the metadata and have all the high witches help with tagging and refinement for each individual layer.\n\nAs the system evolved, our internal “witch roller” let us perceive the sum of these parts as the high witches refined separate aspects, spot-checking for edge cases as we added new assets. Articulations from Keridwen inspired visual styles, Xuannü charted the stars at each WITCH's summoning, and Aradia bequeathed each a name.\n\nthe overall structure of the generator also boiled down to something quite simple, thanks to the abstractions in our data model. (though hair continued to be quite complex)\n\nWhen we needed to make a one-off exception for a certain art asset, Xuannü’s system of dependencies , exclusions , and requirements extended past attributes to individual styles, giving us the abstractions to create specific styles and tweak what assets they did not work with dynamically in our database.\n\nWorking with Aletheia to draw new styles and layering on rules and logic to accommodate them in the generator became a satisfying mix of art and science.\n\nTo define new rulesets, I’d roll massive test sets scanning for clipping errors and pulling out patterns where assets would clash.\n\nSome edge cases were easier to solve in the art files, like accommodating bangs with transparency. Styles like the buzz cut and baby hairs needed to conditionally render on top of other assets that sat on the head, like horns or crowns causing clipping errors.\n\nFor the buzz cut, we ended up baking it into the base model, since there was no way to render the style that worked across skin tones and have it cover the base of horns properly. For baby hairs, it was easier to lower the hairline to not conflict with the horn assets.\n\nBy the end, we were able to accommodate an expressive range of fantastical and realistic styles combined with random-ish generation, like this rather generous interpretation of “hat” across the different archetypes I’m quite proud of.\n\nWith millions of potential witches, the last step of generation was a hand of human curation, and choosing which witches would be added to the collection. While most glaring visual issues were gone 🤞, aestheic preference that could not be captured by broad rules of thumb were imprinted in this final phase. (Aletheia still caught some subtle edge cases I definitely missed.)

Take Back the Future! - Reboot","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/manifesto?s=r","content":"Today, I’m sharing what I wrote for Kernel Magazine’s opening essay: a manifesto explaining the personal, philosophical, and historical impetus behind Reboot’s existence. It locates our work in a history of people, ideas, and movements who have sought to align technological and sociopolitical progress.\n\nKernel Magazine costs $40 for the full print and digital edition — plus access to monthly events and audio recordings of posts like this one. All surplus revenue supports Reboot’s future work and a shift toward an organizational model that is created and funded by our community.\n\nIf you’ve already subscribed, get the audio version of this essay here .\n\nI came into college as a baby “social justice warrior” planning to major in ethnic studies and become a professor. I was deeply skeptical of capitalism and the state, so academia seemed like a refuge — the only career path that was intellectually and politically pure. But when I arrived at Stanford in the wake of the 2016 election and the start of the “techlash,” I was shocked to see how much money, power, and attention still poured into the pockets of 20-something engineers who clearly had little idea of what to do with it. Whether or not I liked it, tech was having a huge impact on the communities and issues I cared about, so I wanted to get up to speed on tech, its builders, and its underlying philosophies.\n\nI began by reading countless books about Silicon Valley: The Know It Alls by Noam Cohen, Hackers by Steven Levy, even Ben Horowitz’s The Hard Thing About Hard Things and Peter Thiel’s Zero To One. I talked to venture capitalists and reported on startups for a campus publication. I found myself surprisingly enthralled by the experimental, fast-moving, and forward-looking culture of the startup scene. Tech leaders possessed an infectious optimism: an unfailing belief in the possibility of making the world better than they found it.\n\nStill, I feared selling out, and I was dubious about leaning into an industry that had caused such harm. I sought out more critical, diverse, and interdisciplinary perspectives in science, technology, and society studies (STS), where scholars were already thinking about the intersection of technology and social justice. While STS offers useful frameworks for describing problems, many articles concluded by blanket rejecting a technology or positing no alternative at all. This cynicism didn’t resonate with my experience. Like many others my age, I grew up on the internet. I learned to write by publishing on Wordpress, pursued niche research passions from late nights on Google Scholar, and found community in online forums and Twitter group chats when I felt loneliest as a teen. I knew Google and Facebook didn’t have my best interests in mind, but quitting them felt equally untenable.\n\nIn theory, it’s easy to reject technology wholesale, but in practice, that means ceding its power to myopic megacorporations. Extreme techno-pessimism absolves technologists of using their skills for good, and absolves the left of using technology’s speed and scale to empower people. Like science fiction writer Ted Chiang said in an interview with journalist Ezra Klein, “Most of our fears or anxieties about technology are best understood as fears or anxiety about how capitalism will use technology against us.” The challenge, then, is how to disentangle the two.\n\nMy goal is to make the case for a progressive techno-optimism: not blind faith in the powers that control technology today, but in our ability as thinkers, builders, and organizers to join together and deploy technology for a better collective future. Technology is neither inherently good nor bad; rather, it can be part of a broader political project of securing the “good life” for everyone.\n\nTo imagine a feasible future for progressive technology, we have to first recognize the gains of the past. The soaring optimism of the 2000s and early 2010s had some basis in reality. The internet presented us with radical new ways of connecting with each other, sharing resources, and creating knowledge outside of institutional and geographic bounds.\n\nAs faith in financial, political, and media institutions collapsed, networked technologies formed the foundation for grassroots movements like the Arab Spring, #MeToo, and Black Lives Matter. On Twitter, people spread protest messages beyond their immediate social networks, moving from viral tweets to thousands-large demonstrations from Zuccotti Park to Tahrir Square. Smartphones enabled people to countersurveil police brutality, share the evidence, and hold the state accountable. Although Twitter, Apple, and Google might not have designed their products for activist uses, the ways people repurposed these tools highlighted their progressive potentials.\n\nPeople discovered infinite channels to tell their own stories and raise concerns about neglected issues from net neutrality to prison abolition, trans rights to unsafe workplace conditions. In an everyday context, free educational resources on Wikipedia, Khan Academy, and even YouTube allow individual volunteers to teach millions. Those with marginalized identities, such as LGBTQ+ people and people facing domestic violence, have found both community and crisis support online when it was not safe to do so in their physical environments. Internet platforms might not themselves be altruistic actors, but they expand the capabilities of those who are.\n\nDismissing these benefits would be just as ahistorical as dismissing technology’s harms. Many of these outcomes were only possible because software is cheap and scalable. The goal is not to prove that these technologies are perfect or that they cannot be co-opted. Rather, technology is one tool in the toolbox — an immensely and undeniably powerful one — in fighting for the future we want.\n\nIn light of these potentials, where did tech go wrong? Past techno-utopian movements have often assumed that titans of industry drive progress for everyone else, and any attempts to slow down their plans — protests, regulation, ethics committees, and more — are blockers to opportunity.\n\nFor example, the early cypherpunks of the 1980s, including cryptographers like Timothy C. May, emphasized the importance of untraceable online identities for evading “governmental regulation, taxation, or interference.” By the turn of the millennium, WIRED Magazine was publishing gushing profiles of young founders next to Newt Gingrich’s anti-regulation tirades. Critical coverage was all but absent throughout the 2000s. Instead, a credulous tech press framed tech founders as boy geniuses changing the world by “democratizing” access to knowledge, jobs, or enterprise software. In 2020, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen published his pro-progress manifesto “It’s Time To Build,” blaming partisan gridlock and bureaucratic inefficiency for the United States’s inability to scale access to the resources — housing supply, ventilators, university education — that innovators created.\n\nThis kind of thinking suggests that new tech should be built first — usually by a small, elite, homogenous group — and social questions should get punted to policymakers, who often end up lagging decades behind. By the time diversity, ethics, and access enter the conversation, large corporations will have already locked in their technological dominance and naturalized their harms. For example, as Amazon built an empire on the promise of super-fast shipping, consumers grew to accept inhumane warehouse conditions as a necessary cost of convenience.\n\nFurthermore, tech companies have not only profited from phone addictions and teen anxiety, but they’ve also aided and abetted governments in violating human rights. Facebook’s lack of moderation in Myanmar enabled Burmese military personnel to orchestrate a genocide of the Muslim Rohingya minority group. In the U.S., judges use biased risk assessment software like COMPAS to keep Black defendants in prison for longer than their white counterparts, and Palantir develops tools for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to surveil, detain, and deport undocumented Americans. While early tech leaders hoped to liberate humanity from hierarchical governments, their products instead multiplied the available channels for exerting control.\n\nSystemic problems require systemic solutions. We can recognize that technology is critical to our future without replicating the narrow techno-utopianism of the past. From the beginning, a new left techno-optimism must be willing to engage with social justice, politics, and history in a way that past techno-utopians have not.\n\nWe cannot shy from the social. Algorithmic bias, workplace harassment, and viral hate speech show how structural inequality — sexism, racism, and classism — seep and scale through our technological systems. Instead, our analysis must be intersectional, and our new centers of power diverse. Equity must be baked into every stage of technological development, from problem identification to team-building to design to distribution. Most importantly, social justice is a social effort. Beyond just augmenting individual ability, we must build technologies for cooperation, redistribution, and collective action.\n\nWe cannot shy from the political. In the past, tech leaders placed new tools in the hands of old hegemons, and were surprised when oppression persisted or people resisted. Yet power shapes what gets built, by whom, how, and for whom. Decisions such as a company’s organizational structure or whether to cooperate with government censorship are embedded in politics. Additionally, as tech companies approach new domains like healthcare, cities, and education, they will need to learn from policymakers, advocates, and the public rather than running roughshod over local laws and livelihoods.\n\nWe cannot shy from the historical. Many technologists seem to fear history, instead pursuing escapist visions — seasteading, charter cities, Mars colonization — that offer them blank slates to design from. Even well-intentioned founders can end up replicating historical power dynamics, such as coding bootcamps with tuition models eerily similar to for-profit colleges or emotion-scanning artificial intelligence that acts as a 21st century phrenology. Only by knowing our history can we pattern-match for risks and opportunities, distinguishing the broken and stale from the truly inventive.\n\nThese principles call for a dramatically different tech industry and society from what we have today. Yet power demands counterpower; our efforts can be both generative and adversarial. When prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba describes hope as a “discipline” and philosopher Ernst Bloch calls for “militant optimism,” both emphasize the centrality of ongoing, conscious effort in bringing about justice.\n\nIn going from ideals to action, one useful framework is the “utopian demand” as defined by feminist theorist Kathi Weeks. She describes it as “a political demand that takes the form not of a narrowly pragmatic reform but of a more substantial transformation of the present configuration of social relations; it is a demand that raises eyebrows, one for which we would probably not expect immediate success.” Examples of utopian demands might include prison abolition or a universal basic income, but what’s most important is that the utopian demand is not informed by political feasibility alone but by its end vision. Weeks continues, “To make a demand is to affirm the present desires of existing subjects: this is what we want now. At the same time, the utopian demand also points in the direction of a different future and the possibility of desires and subjects yet to come.”\n\nWhat utopian demands might we dream of for technology’s future? Who is working on bringing them about?\n\nOne set of demands must involve thwarting dangerous and oppressive technologies. Reclaiming technology for a just society means being accountable for what we decide to build. Drawing clear ethical boundaries sets a precedent against the use of technology to control and police people, and toward a world where civil society plays a larger role in deciding where and how technology can be exercised.\n\nResearchers, like those at the Algorithmic Justice League, study tech’s current and potential harms. Movements like Mijente’s #NoTechForICE and the Campaign To Stop Killer Robots rally public opinion against harmful uses of technology. Meanwhile, policymakers have imposed regulations locally, like San Francisco’s ban on police use of facial recognition; federally, like the Biden administration’s push for stronger antitrust action; or internationally, like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nResistance has also spanned tech worker activism, such as Google workers’ refusal of Project Maven, a Department of Defense contract to build computer vision for drones; Gig Workers Rising’s “No on 22” campaign to secure a living wage; and unionization efforts at Alphabet, Kickstarter, and digital media outfits like the Times Tech Guild. While campaigns often react to particular ethical oversights, each builds workers’ collective capacity to assert decision-making power over their working conditions and the outputs they produce.\n\nFinally, technologists can use their skills to identify abuses of power and build defensive infrastructures in their place. For example, whistleblower Edward Snowden could not have learned about the National Security Agency’s privacy violations without first being a high-level system administrator, and he could not have safely leaked what he knew without understanding the intricate tripwires of the NSA surveillance network. As Snowden posits in his memoir Permanent Record, “As long as legal innovation lags behind technological innovation, institutions will seek to abuse that disparity… It falls to… developers to close that gap by providing the vital civil liberties protections that the law may be unable, or unwilling, to guarantee.”\n\nIn addition to resistance, we need parallel efforts around imagining better worlds and building the tools, resources, and infrastructure that will get us there. Unlike those of past techno-utopians, these projects can be promising because they start with an understanding of our social, political, and historical conditions before scoping tech’s role.\n\nWe should start with visioning: telling stories about who will be included and how; rallying people around technology’s human potentials rather than its abstract technical features. Early science fiction, from Russian cosmists’ writing on spaceflight to Vernor Vinge’s pseudonymous web, catalyzed decades of research and development that turned ideas into reality. Yet unlike these past sci-fi scenes, our visions for a progressive techno-optimism must be shaped by diverse voices. We can draw inspiration from Afrofuturism, the cultural movement that tells alternate histories and speculative futures by and for Black people. From the blockbuster movie Black Panther to author Octavia Butler’s novel Kindred, Afrofuturists weave narratives based in Afro-diasporic history and modern technology. Speculative fiction thus becomes an instrument for opening up new frontiers of investigation, creating new solutions, and giving marginalized people the opportunity to design the worlds they want to live in.\n\nThe government can play a major role in funding transformative technology research. The famed Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is a federal agency granted wide latitude to fund moonshot-style R\u0026D on defense-related technologies, an approach that has led to historic breakthroughs like the laser and the internet. We should push policymakers to invest in similarly ambitious efforts for other domains, from climate modeling to pharmaceutical development. Federal funding also offers a sorely needed alternative to industry-dominated research. The vast majority of AI research today happens in Google’s, Facebook’s, and Microsoft’s thick-walled research arms, making it hard for universities to compete on salaries or compute. Instead, projects like a National Research Cloud or funding for massive open datasets democratize access to AI resources, and can be coupled with policy requiring that resulting research is published in the public domain.\n\nNext, we’ll need to create devices that help people call out and circumvent inaccessible, hostile, or corrupt systems. The messaging app Signal and the Tor network are encrypted technologies that protect the safety of dissidents, journalists, sex workers, and other groups at risk of suppression and censorship. Upsolve became the largest bankruptcy nonprofit in the U.S. in three years, empowering millions of people who couldn’t afford lawyers to file for bankruptcy for free online. Raheem AI developed a chatbot to anonymously report experiences with police, while Callisto offers a similar recording, reporting, and matching system for survivors of sexual assault. The Ameelio app connects incarcerated people with loved ones, offering a free alternative to exorbitantly priced prison phone calls and reducing recidivism in the long run. The publication The Markup accompanies their tech accountability journalism with apps such as a promotion-free search engine and a website privacy inspector.\n\nMany of the most interesting innovations revolve around novel production, funding, and ownership models that shift the balance of power toward workers and ordinary people. Commons-based peer production (CBPP), the system that produced critical open infrastructure such as Wikipedia and Linux, involves a large volunteer community supported by smaller revenue-generating and governance arms. While CBPP promotes broader participation in shaping technology, the newer platform cooperative model gives these workers equity to reap the rewards. For example, The Drivers Cooperative is a ridesharing platform that employs over 2,500 New York cab drivers as worker-owners and pays them eight to ten percent more per ride than their venture-backed competitors. In the future, the blockchain may create the technical foundation for new forms of social, political, and economic organization built on principles of openness, transparency, and participation. These new structures, called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), can be used for anonymous voting systems, creator cooperatives, and community-run treasuries. One example is MakerDAO, a price-stable global cryptocurrency governed by a protocol and stakeholder community rather than a central bank. These models are all exciting testing grounds for wider participation in the economy.\n\nPower is sticky, and systemic change is hard. We need people working on all these projects in tandem. We have to diversify our bets from technology to organizing, from government to grassroots change. We need to talk to and learn from each other; we need to see ourselves as part of a shared mission. And instead of enforcing alignment to a rigid ideological consensus, we need to accept the possibility — or probability — of disagreement, conflict, and failure. These iterative processes make our movement more robust. They are essential, inevitable components of pluralism itself.\n\nWhere does Reboot fit into this constellation of efforts? Reboot is a publication and a community, a knowledge ecosystem and a convening space, a classroom and a network and a digital playground all dedicated to reclaiming techno-optimism for a better collective future.\n\nWhile we avoid prescribing particular tactics or policy positions, Reboot’s work embodies a set of shared frameworks. Our analysis starts with power, both technological and political. First, we analyze technology in the context of the institutions and ideologies it shapes and is shaped by. Our discussion topics span history, theory, and current events; topics from job hunting to Marxism to accessible design. Second, we see theory and practice as mutually informative. We support technologists in being thinkers, writers, and advocates through programs like our undergraduate fellowship and open pitch process. Finally, we view optimism as an action, not a belief. We move between systemic analysis and our personal theories of change. We insist on embracing our agency to build a better world than the one we inherited.\n\nReboot’s programs form a flywheel between content and community, beginning with our public-facing media. With the ivory tower of academia looming on one side and uncritical startup hype on the other, we insist on publishing critical yet generative content that is written by and for technologists. For example, our volunteer-run newsletter spotlights the work of activists, founders, artists, and researchers; every month, we host authors who write science fiction, startup journalism, and cultural criticism. By learning in public, we bring new members with varied backgrounds into the community, spark partnerships with existing organizations working on related issues, and move closer to our long-term goal of facilitating a culture shift in technology.\n\nFinally, our internal community coordinates our volunteer task forces and acts as a gathering space for a wide-ranging group of curious, open-minded, and mission-driven technologists. In an industry where there is rarely space to read and reflect, our members self-organize book clubs to learn about our role in broader systems of power. In a political environment where polarization runs deep, we insist on the discussion norms of assuming good faith and calling each other in instead of out. In a society where communities are increasingly privatized and commodified, we emphasize openness through remote-first programs and a norm of resource-sharing. And in a generation that has struggled to maintain hope in the future, we challenge each other to write about the version of the world we want to live in and the steps we’ll take to get there.\n\nAfter the Cold War, mass anxiety quickly turned into rage at the military-industrial institutions that brought society so close to the brink. From the ashes, two main youth movements emerged. One was the New Communalists, who believed that a cocktail of personal computing and psychedelic drugs could offer refuge from government power and the struggle in the streets. The other was the New Left, a campus-centric movement encompassing direct action campaigns for feminism, pacifism, free speech, and civil rights. Long after they dissipated, these movements had major downstream effects on the cultures of technology and politics respectively.\n\nToday, we’ve found ourselves in a similar historical moment. The triple whammy of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the COVID-19 pandemic destroyed any faith people had in corporate and political elites to save us. Tech companies, once hailed as fearless changemakers, turned out to be just as susceptible to greed, callousness, and corruption. Faced with a slew of big life decisions amid this uncertain environment, I’ve found myself asking: where do we go from here?\n\nOne option is to recuse ourselves from social responsibility. One could work at Facebook for the free lunches or join a low-tech commune in the woods. Another is uprising: shouting grandiose calls to burn society down, lighting symbolic bonfires to make the revolution seem real. But a third option, the most difficult, is to lean into the challenge ahead of us. After all, our work is not separate from our personal identities, our political beliefs, and our duties as thinkers, citizens, and advocates. As technologists, the labor market has granted us disproportionate leverage over the industry. This privilege is a duty. We should situate ourselves in broader systems of power; we should consider how we can either help or harm. We cannot use code to abstract ourselves from consequences. We see progress not as a guarantee, but as something to chip away at, day by day.\n\nReclaiming techno-optimism means reclaiming human optimism. We must seek a shared vision of the world that is just, equitable, and abundant. We have the resources to bring it about. Utopianism implies a state of unattainable perfection, but optimism requires the simple yet daring belief that we have agency over our future.\n\nThis is a pre-release.

Towards Ineffective Altruism","link":"https://reboothq.substack.com/p/ineffective-altruism?s=r","content":"Today’s essay is long so I’ll keep this intro short: read it! to the end! happy sunday longread!\n\nDo not allow your dreams of a beautiful world to lure you away from the claims of men who suffer here and now. Our fellow men have a claim to our help; no generation must be sacrificed for the sake of future generations, for the sake of an ideal of happiness that may never be realized.\n\nThis tweet from Timnit Gebru has been living in my head rent-free for the past month. Recently, she and other critics of big tech (as well as former longtermist Phil Torres) have been loudly sounding the alarm about effective altruism and longtermism on Twitter and in various publications.\n\nThese ideologies scare me, and I want to engage with them seriously — not because I believe in them, but because they are seemingly rational, relying on the language of science, moral philosophy, and statistics. They are increasingly influential among policymakers, intellectuals, well-funded institutions, and the richest men in the world. Their ubiquity makes them pernicious and hard to combat. To take them on, we must critique their philosophical foundations, their rhetoric, and their material impacts simultaneously.\n\nAt its most basic, the effective altruism movement makes a generally utilitarian argument about how the world’s privileged people should spend their time and money if they want to maximize their positive impact on the world.\n\nEffective altruism was born mostly at Oxford in the late 1990s and early 2000s, at around the same time that the internet industry in Silicon Valley was experiencing its first cycle of boom and bust. The dominant ideologies of both come from the business culture of the time, and the two have become closer together since. As Nadia Asparouhova writes in her recent piece on “Idea Machines”: “Effective altruism is often associated with tech, but it’s genetically more similar to McKinsey.”\n\nNowadays, effective altruism’s epistemology and tools often parallel those of the tech industry. At its heart, it is driven by the principle of maximization and informed by statistical analysis. With these methods, effective altruists make arguments such as maximizing disability-adjusted life-years by allocating time and money towards initiatives that provide a mosquito net for a child in a poor country (rather than providing direct donations to the child’s family).\n\nAt first glance, this all seems straightforward and uncontroversial, even if it speaks of “doing good” in the terms of a business investment. If we want to make the world a better place by giving money away, of course we should maximize the good that each dollar does , you might say. And besides, how bad can an ideology be if its principal goal is to give billions of *maximally effective* dollars away to charity each year?\n\nThese are fair points, and I don’t entirely disagree with them. Billions of dollars per year from the wealthy tech elite used to convince people to go vegan or to give to non-religious health NGOs or to end factory farming is not, on its face, a bad thing.\n\nBut effective altruism is just the tip of the utilitarian iceberg. Beneath the visible argument that giving must be optimized in order to be “good,” there are an array of ideologies in close contact with effective altruism that are far stranger, more ethically dubious, and highly influential. Foremost among them is the ideology of longtermism — an ideology that Phil Torres (a former longtermist himself) has described as “one of the most influential ideologies that few people outside of elite universities and Silicon Valley have ever heard about.”\n\nLongtermism originates from the same spaces and places as effective altruism, including the rationalist community and online blogs like LessWrong. If we can survive the next few hundred years, colonize other worlds, and learn to simulate conscious beings with computers, longtermists say, there could be a lot of people that exist in the future. The high end of the range is 1058 (10 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion), but most say there could be at least quad- or quintillions. If all beings are equally important, regardless of when or where they exist, then doing something right now that has a tiny probability (say, a one in one quintillion chance) of affecting a tiny fraction of the future people (0.00000000000000000000000000001% — that’s 28 zeros), could still potentially change the lives of more than 10 billion people, more than the nearly 8 billion people existing on the planet today.\n\nFrom this time-and-space-agnostic view, the current state of the world and the humans in it begins to seem miniscule, a grain of sand in the beach of a future that may span galaxies and trillions of years.\n\nWith this perspective, new priorities emerge. Instead of focusing on the material inequities of our world, longtermists think that the way to do the most good in the long-term is to focus on the things that could prevent this unthinkably large set of futures from coming to pass. Thus, we ought to focus on studying and reducing existential risks — potential developments that could wipe humanity out completely or permanently constrain humanity before it achieves its full potential. Existential risks include global totalitarian governments, deadly pandemics, asteroids, nuclear wars, misaligned hyper-intelligent AI systems that destroy human civilization, and other unspecified horrors.\n\n“Strong longtermism” is a variant of longtermism advanced by Hilary Greaves and William MacAskill that argues that, “for the purposes of evaluating actions, we can in the first instance often simply ignore all the effects contained in the first 100 (or even 1000) years, focusing primarily on the further-future effects.” An extended quotation from their paper is illustrative of the impacts that these ideologies can have. Let’s say Shivani, a philanthropic donor, wants to donate $10,000 to the cause that will do the most good:\n\nSuppose, for instance, Shivani thinks there’s a 1% probability of a transition to a world government in the next century, and that $1 billion of well-targeted grants… would increase the well-being in an average future life, under the world government, by 0.1% with a 0.1% chance of that effect lasting until the end of civilisation, and that the impact of grants in this area is approximately linear with respect to the amount of spending. Then, using [a] figure of one quadrillion lives to come, the expected good done by Shivani contributing $10,000 to this goal would… be 100 lives. In contrast, funding for the Against Malaria Foundation, often regarded as the most cost-effective intervention in the area of short-term global health improvements, on average saves one life per $3500.\n\nIn simple terms, Shivani can save 35 expected future lives for each current life she can save. In this instance, the premier example of donating based on effective altruist principles is utterly ineffective compared to the logic of longtermism and existential risk. The idea that studying existential risk and reducing it by a fraction of a percent could improve the lives of untold future millions is a powerful one.\n\nOf course, longtermism is not the principal motivation for most effective altruists, and there are gradations of how far one can subscribe to this argument. Regardless, in recent years, it has increasingly begun to drive giving, set priorities, and define the movement as a whole, prompting some to ask if effective altruism is just longtermism now .\n\nEffective altruism and longermism are ideologies that are increasingly influential among the richest men and the most prestigious institutions in the world, shaping policy and capital allocation. The movement has shifted to pushing young adherents towards careers in government, with a focus on reducing existential risks through policy. These recent developments take our discussion away from questions of rhetoric and morals (for the moment) and squarely into material considerations.\n\nLongtermism and existential risk are particularly influential ideologies among those who made fortunes in technology and in elite institutions. Elon Musk has cited the work of Nick Bostrom (who coined the term existential risk in 2002) and has donated millions to the Future of Humanity Institute and Future of Life Institute, sister organizations based out of Oxford. Jean Tallinn, a founder of Skype worth an estimated $900 million in 2019, also cofounded the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge, and has donated more than a million dollars to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI). Vitalik Buterin, a cofounder of the Ethereum cryptocurrency, has donated extensively to MIRI as well. Peter Thiel, the radical libertarian donor, early Trump supporter, and funder of JD Vance’s Ohio Senate campaign, delivered the keynote address at the 2013 Effective Altruism summit.\n\nLongtermism is also increasingly popular among rank-and-file effective altruists, to the point where many consider them to be synonymous. According to data from the Open Philanthropy Grants database, in 2021 effective altruists donated $92 million to AI risk research, $21 million to biosecurity and pandemic preparedness, and $10.5 million to global catastrophic risk research. Altogether, this $125 million towards longtermist existential risk research represents a larger slice of donations than any other individual cause. And the allure of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) — a major focus/fear of effective altruism and longtermism — is especially clear in industry, where multiple startups and big tech companies pour billions of dollars into research and development.\n\nThese bureaucrats, donors, research institutes, and companies are by no means an ideological monolith, nor do they necessarily represent the beliefs of the average effective altruist. However, this web of entities has one key feature — intellectual, institutional, and financial capital. A relatively small cadre of longtermist academics housed within and legitimized by influential institutions can advance ideas that guide how governments and venture capitalists think about and shape the future.\n\nSo far, in the spirit of critique, I’ve laid out the philosophical underpinnings of the effective altruism and longtermism movements and the material superstructures that have arisen from those foundations over the past two decades.\n\nIt seems to me that the seemingly limitless bounds of longtermism are ultimately a moral carte blanche on anything we do (except make the species extinct). It’s easy to see how this position can ultimately lead to reprehensible outcomes. Just this week, 80,000 Hours released a piece that argues for effective altruists to not focus their careers on climate change — a process which will uproot hundreds of millions of mostly non-white poor people and cause billions to experience chronic water scarcity — because it has a low chance of becoming uncontrollable and turning Earth into Venus. Other longtermists worry that their ideology would provide rationalizations for genocide if political leaders took it literally . Mathematical statistician Olle Häggström, usually a proponent of longtermism, imagines\n\na situation where the head of the CIA explains to the US president that they have credible evidence that somewhere in Germany, there is a lunatic who is working on a doomsday weapon and intends to use it to wipe out humanity, and that this lunatic has a one-in-a-million chance of succeeding. They have no further information on the identity or whereabouts of this lunatic. If the president has taken Bostrom’s argument to heart, and if he knows how to do the arithmetic, he may conclude that it is worthwhile conducting a full-scale nuclear assault on Germany to kill every single person within its borders.\n\nBesides the moral hazards of advocating these positions, these ideologies provide an overly simplistic formula for doing good: 1) define “good” as a measurable metric, 2) find the most effective means of impacting that metric, and 3) pour capital into scaling those means up.\n\nBut following the formula of effective altruism is clearly not all that being good requires. There are boundless ways of doing good that are fundamentally immeasurable or, if they are measurable, may not be optimized. Nevertheless, this universe of actions demands our consideration. To follow in the footsteps of Timnit Gebru (and to be purposefully contrarian), let’s call the philosophy of seriously considering the merits of doing good immeasurably or suboptimally ineffective altruism.\n\nIneffective altruism might look like giving $10 to a houseless person who asks for it . It might look like organizing to ensure that as many people as possible have access to basic material needs like food, housing, and healthcare. It might look like the ephemeral work of knitting a social and political community together. After all, how can one quantify the resiliency of a particular neighborhood? None of these actions would be particularly “effective,” and yet they might also have more of a tangible impact than unknowably reducing an existential risk by some fraction of a percentage point. They also show an understanding of one’s responsibilities to their community, how strengthening community is also important for our shared future, even if it isn’t measurable.\n\nIneffective altruism eschews metrics, because “What does doing good look like?” should be a continuously-posed question rather than an optimization problem. As an ideology of allocating resources, it is recognized as explicitly political, rather than cloaking itself in the discourse of science and rationality. It allows us to get outside of the concept of altruism entirely — a concept that feels limiting in its focus on the actions of the individual — and instead consider a paradigm of collective, democratic mutual aid. Most importantly, ineffective altruism allows us to ask harder questions than effective altruism does: questions about who and what we value.\n\nWhat might “moral good” look like outside of market-derived values (like the maximization principle)? How can we collectively decide to allocate resources? How can we build societies based on principles that cannot be measured, like mutual respect and solidarity? How can we eliminate material misery from the world? What might we do to ensure the flourishing of future generations, rather than just their survival? How can we depart from a society where those who have the privilege to choose to care about others can , and move towards a society where everyone has the power to care about others and must ?\n\nPeople all over the world have been attempting to answer these questions for generations. After massive street protests in 2019 in Chile, 80% of the population voted to redraft the nation’s constitution — an effort that is currently in progress and will be finalized this September. In Taiwan, Digital Minister Audrey Tang is building effective tools for building consensus and making decisions online. Tang helped enable a highly effective set of COVID-19 policies that kept the disease largely outside Taiwan for more than two years, influenced what digital democracy looks like on the island, and inspired other online civil processes around the world. And in the United States, the last few years has seen rising interest in small-d democratic institutions like labor unions and mutual aid organizations . These efforts may be inefficient or messy or unpredictable, but are good in part because of those facts, not in spite of them.\n\nAs we get some distance from effective altruism and longtermism, we can also begin to consider other ways of thinking about the long-term future. Our conceptions of the future inform our actions today, and the future is much too important to cede to an ideology with the ethos and rhetoric of longtermism. Seventh-generation decision making, for example, is an indigenous principle that is enshrined in the Constitution of the Iroquois Nation. It mandates Iroquois leaders to consider the effects of their actions over seven generations, encompassing hundreds of years. Seven generations is a long time, but it is also a finite amount of time. Although this framework prioritizes long-term thinking, it doesn’t bring the weight of infinity to bear on the present. And unlike longtermism, the seventh-generation principle doesn’t pretend to be scientific. It doesn’t rely on unfalsifiable guesses about a future we can’t even imagine to assign expected values to different political decisions; rather, it makes thinking about the future a moral imperative.\n\n​​Philosopher Karl Popper on about the dangers of exclusive focus on the utopian ideal of the far future over the material concerns of the present day:\n\nWe must not argue that a certain social situation is a mere means to an end on the grounds that it is merely a transient historical situation. For all situations are transient. Similarly we must not argue that the misery of one generation may be considered as a mere means to the end of securing the lasting happiness of some later generation or generations; and this argument is improved neither by a high degree of promised happiness nor by a large number of generations profiting by it. All generations are transient. All have an equal right to be considered, but our immediate duties are undoubtedly to the present generation and to the next.\n\nWhen we critically examine effective altruism and longtermism, we can see them as falsely utopian ideologies cloaked in the opaque vocabulary of science and math. Let’s instead strive for a world where altruism doesn’t have to be maximally effective for it to be worthy, where doing good doesn’t have to be optimized, where morals aren’t a function of the market.\n\nReboot is a volunteer-run labor of love.

- by nancy zuo - general zuo's chicken","link":"https://nancyzuo.substack.com/p/coexisting?s=r","content":"During the last 1.5 months, I lived in a co-living house with 11 other interesting people I met online in NYC. It was one of the most transformative and enlightening experiences I’ve had, and costed less than half the cost of school tuition. I’ve gotten a lot of inquiries/requests to create a starter guide to finding co-living, and here it is! In this piece, I’ll go over why I think co-living is the best alternative to school, tips on finding a co-living house, and a list of popular co-living houses I’ve heard around the space.\n\nI first found out about co-living houses (specifically, Edyfi ) through a Slack channel during Treehacks and thought it was intriguing but hadn’t heard of anyone who has done it before. I was a little nervous to try it out in fear that it would be like the “hacker house” start-up culture I saw in the HBO show Silicon Valley .\n\nI didn’t want to risk living in a high tech-bro culture, so decided not to apply. However, I kept it in the back of my mind.\n\nOver the summer, I watched a vlog by Maggie , in which she vlogged the experience of living in Edyfi, the co-living program I was looking at. Watching the vlog, I instantly regretted not applying. It looked like an amazing experience, nothing like that portrayed in Silicon Valley, and I knew that I would jump on the opportunity to live there in the future.\n\nTo assuage my regrets, I decided to arrange an Airbnb and do my own group house with some high school friends in Seattle. Our internships were all remote, so it was convenient to work together in the house. One of my friends interned at Amazon and was allowed to bring up to 6 guests in each day, so it was also nice for all of us to use the Amazon HQ as a Wework.\n\nDoing the group house in Seattle confirmed my love for living in a house with others. Previously, I had only lived at home, in a dorm, and then in a shared one-bedroom apartment with one roommate. I loved the community living at the house with my friends, and wanted to do it more, but this time with people I’ve never met before.\n\nWhile living in the Seattle house with my friends, I received an email to join the Discord group for Reboot , a Substack newsletter on techno-optimism. Through Reboot, I met so many interesting people, many of which overlapped with the co-living space. Particularly, Ivan and Jacky were living in the Edyfi houses at the time, and I also saw that Ben (who started Edyfi) was in the Discord group as well.\n\nAfter my internship ended at the end of July, I wanted to spend my August really well, so I got a one-month trial to WeWork (TYSM ivan ❤️). Every day, I went to a different WeWork around the Bay and went to a couple in Philadelphia on a trip there a week before classes started. As classes drew near, I felt really torn. On one hand, I really wanted to go back to classes in person, but on the other I had learned so much during my one month going to WeWorks and self-learning that I didn’t think school would’ve been more productive for me. I knew that school would just drain away my time towards things I didn’t feel like learning in the moment.\n\nAt one point in August, I received an email from Ben after seeing a thread on Ladder on co-living houses and signing up for Together per someone’s comment.\n\nI signed up to chat with Ben despite not having taken a leave yet just to get this on the table in case I decide to take a leave. Talking to him further confirmed my interests in joining one of the houses, but I still couldn’t push myself to bite the bullet just yet. Ultimately, I felt too much FOMO going back in-person to take a leave, so I didn’t get to join the house before all the spots filled up.\n\nThe first day of school felt like a dream. It felt like the very first day of college classes again, and it was so nice seeing the campus filled with people once again. I felt rushes of adrenaline from meeting new people in classes, and seeing familiar zoom faces irl.\n\nHowever, a couple weeks in when midterms started to hit, the magic of meeting people started to fade. People started getting too busy with trivial assignments, I started losing interest in my schoolwork, and bureaucratic class processes frustrated me once again.\n\nI had already experienced school back in person, and I didn’t like it. I created a thread in Reboot and asked others who’ve taken a leave for advice. To my surprise, so many people chimed in and helped me in making my decision. More often than not, I heard that others regretted not taking a leave over taking one. I knew I’d definitely regret it if I didn’t do it now, so I finally did it .\n\nSince I was now a leave, I started looking back into co-living. Originally was going to try to find a co-living house and then find a sub-letter for my Pittsburgh apartment. I posted a listing in CMU rent/sublet on Facebook and found a couple people. Since it was the middle of the semester, these people were a little weird and I couldn’t find a good fit for the fall. I did find someone for the spring, so at least I got that out of the way. At around the same time, I spoke to Ami from Together and he told me all the houses currently available were in SF. I didn’t really want to go to SF, but did speak to two of the leads on houses that were opening up there just in case I changed my mind. I kept my ears peeled for spaces in NYC or LA, and decided to stay in Pittsburgh for the moment. I booked a trip to NYC for the end of October to early November just to visit instead.\n\nA couple weeks later, I saw a tweet from Together saying there was a spot that was open in the NYC house. This was it.\n\nI instantly replied and got pulled into a group with together, Ben, and Luke to chat more.\n\nAfter chatting, they told me that the start date was ideally November 1st. I was already headed to NYC for October 28th, so the only difference would be I don’t come back from NYC after staying there.\n\nI talked to Ben and deliberated for a little — I had a campus job so I would be leaving that, had to cut off my club obligations, would be moving in with a very tight time-frame, would be abandoning my apartment without fully moving out, and would be paying for both Pittsburgh and NYC rent.\n\nHowever, I ultimately decided that it was worth it. I had never lived in NYC for that long, I was growing tired of being at school without being in school, and I wanted a refresher from finally getting a chance to live with a group of interesting people.\n\nI stayed in my Airbnb in Brooklyn, left in the middle of my stay, didn’t take my return flight back to Pittsburgh, and moved to the house.\n\nI lived on the third floor of the house (the house is 4 floors) in a single. I had a choice to have roommates, but since this was my first time co-living with strangers, I wanted an ease into the community instead of going head-in on having multiple roommates.\n\nI calculated and the costs of rent + living in NYC for 1.5 months was only about half the cost of tuition this semester for the two-month time frame.\n\nOver the next 1.5 months, late night conversations, WeWork sessions, Equinox workouts, Trader Joe’s runs, and steak nights crafted some of the happiest moments of my life. My housemates truly felt like family, and I know I’m so lucky to have shared this chunk of time with them — with many more to come. ✨\n\nI don’t have enough words to describe how amazing the experience was. This was single-handedly the fastest I’ve learned from others and a community, and I haven’t felt this related or connected to others irl for a very long time. I’ll be making a vlog on my experience as well, so stay tuned 😉\n\nOne of the most important parts of college is dorm life, but what if you could get that without the stress of classes? That’s exactly what co-living is.\n\nCo-living is breaking the norm of labor-bound cities, allowing us to be more intentional about where we live and who we live with. It is a way to live with others post-grad (or during school outside dorms), and to have a community after college rather than living with colleagues or being bound to a long-term lease.\n\nThe house is a physical platform to meet people, it is clubhouse irl, it is teleporting in and out of voice chats and into others. It is a seamless combination of what we’ve tried so hard to mimic with urls and online communities but are missing the in-person aspect of.\n\nI see myself living in co-living several more times, and most others that I’ve met don’t stop once they’ve started living in this format and jump from house-to-house because they love it so much.\n\nsign up on together , the platform as the “airbnb of co-living houses” and they will text you when spots open up\n\npost on twitter asking “looking for a place to stay in __, any leads?”\n\ntry visiting a house if you know someone there or connect with someone in the house (there’s also shorter term houses/events like miami hack week or sauced house to try living in a house with others for less than a month)\n\ntalk to people that have lived in the houses before for recommendations or leads, lower-key houses that are not publicized are very common and many houses don’t have a formal application process.\n\nif all else fails, think about making/putting together your own house ! you could be the fire to spark the community of your dreams 🔥\n\nwill be in LA for the next week, then in the bay 23-27th, then off to Hawaii for sauced house until Jan 9th, then off to oxford!! very crazy itinerary but so so excited for it 💖\n\nbeen buying more nfts…….literally becoming a crypto degenerate\n\nbeen working out more at equinox (tried out personal training and loved it) and eating healthier (thanks mehran and matt for influencing me to consuming more protein and frozen fruit)\n\nbleaching my hair to mushroom brown next week 🍄\n\nfinally got my new passport (phew)\n\n;-; lost my new kindle on the airplane to LA, and almost missed my transfer flight and had 10 min to run 20 gates down with my 40lbs of stuff\n\nwill be working on a vlog of my experience at edyfi this next week!\n\nmy face is 80-90% healed from acupuncture, Dr. Li Na 💖 highly recommend if you’re in NYC and need acupuncture\n\nPlease ping me if you’re on the fence of co-living, I’d love to help connect + convince you it’s the way to go.

Remarkable Advantage of Abundant Thinking | First Round Review","link":"https://review.firstround.com/the-remarkable-advantage-of-abundant-thinking","content":"If you consider yourself to be ambitious , this has happened to you. Your alarm goes off, and you’re ambushed by thoughts of the grind ahead; finding that needle in a haystack; denting the universe; the roller coaster that never ends — and many more horrible but unfortunately apt cliches. Today, the groupthink in tech largely believes that you have to suffer and barely survive to succeed. But this is a trap, says sought-after executive coach Katia Verresen , who counsels leaders at Facebook , Stanford , Airbnb , Twitter , and a number of prominent startups .\n\n“You’re not going to build a billion dollar business on a string of bad days. It has to be a sequence of your very best days,” she says. “Your performance is tied 100% to your attitude.”\n\nThe ideal attitude is what she calls Abundant Thinking — a mindset that gives you the creative agency and grit to reach your vision — and, on a daily basis, to design your own life. When Verresen first meets most of her clients, they’re in reactive mode. It’s like they’re in a movie, acting in their job and life without knowing the script or having perspective. Her goal is to put them in the director’s chair, with more choices, perspectives and possibilities to rewrite and upgrade the script as they go.\n\nSeeing these choices is at the root of Abundant Thinking. And, according to Verresen, this couldn’t be more important right now with the economy and fundraising climate shifting. In this exclusive interview, she grounds the concept of abundance in real tactics and actions anyone can use to feel more energized, expand their world view, and achieve their vision of success.\n\nEarly in her work with a client, Verresen will give them a scarcity vs. abundant thinking diagnostic. The goal is to separate out and identify the physiology, feelings and thoughts they experience when they're in a scarcity-driven mindset vs. what they experience when they’re thinking abundantly. This helps them truly feel the distinction and notice the tipping point between these two modes in their everyday lives. That way, they can proactively choose a more constructive attitude. Note, this is closely connected to Verresen’s earlier work on physical, emotional and mental energy , and how important it is for entrepreneurs to maximize and exercise all three .\n\nYou can use the above to identify how you’re feeling and trigger a different response. But what can you do to shift into abundance if you’re feeling so low? Verresen’s developed a large body of work around making this transition. Here, she shares six practical tools to get you started.\n\n“Abundance is really your ability to see more in your life: More options, more choices, more resources. And that starts with noticing more,” says Verresen. “You never have the full story. If you’re in a meeting, there are as many realities as there are people in the room. There’s always a different way to see something.”\n\nThe problem is that we’re biologically wired NOT to notice things.\n\nIn 1999, Harvard published a now popular study where they showed people a video of a small basketball team passing a ball around in a circle. Participants were asked the count the number of times the ball was passed. Simple enough. But after the video, when they were asked if they had noticed anything unusual, more than half had no idea what the researchers were talking about. They'd missed the fact that a person in a full gorilla suit had been walking around the court for a handful of seconds. Over half of people’s brains seemingly deleted this information.\n\nWhat does this tell us about life and work? The brain can only absorb so much. When you’re hyper-focused on a task or an idea, you miss things. “It’s just plain biology. You’re not crazy and other people aren’t stupid. It’s just that our brain is designed to see what it’s already looking for and believes. For example, if your belief is ‘it’s impossible’ or ‘I can’t do it,’ then anything that contradicts you will get thrown out. ”\n\nThis is also how professional groupthink happens, because it literally takes energy to resist it. It’s possible that you’re deleting alternate paths, resources, all kinds of stuff because it doesn’t fit in with this collective view of the world. So think of what awaits you if you can break away from your brain’s default setting: Significant creative and competitive advantage.\n\nWhen you devote time and energy to noticing, new doors open. Serendipity accelerates. You feel like the universe is conspiring to support you. But really, you're just not limiting yourself.\n\nYou can cultivate this abundant mindset and self-awareness. It’s biology. As with anything worthwhile (think exercise, eating healthy), noticing requires exercise to become habit. The best regimen: Ask yourself open-ended questions when you’re feeling the tug of scarcity. Rely on your mind to have recorded information you might not have seen or considered before, but can now be called up. These questions are designed to recover that data and expand your map of reality:\n\nIf I were to experience this situation differently, what might I notice?\n\nWhat are my choices here? (Note: this is not questioning whether you have choices, but rather acknowledging that you definitely do.)\n\nIf I were to perceive something useful here, what would it be?\n\nIf this seemingly impossible task actually is possible, what's my next logical move?\n\nWhat's going right in this situation?\n\nI wonder what it would be like to... (fill in an action that seems to exist outside the scope of possibility.)\n\nWhat resources might I have that I’m not seeing yet?\n\nNoticing is also contingent on letting go of existing boundaries and limiting beliefs — including about your own knowledge. “One of the best things you can do is admit to yourself again and again, out loud ideally, ‘I don’t know what I don’t know.’ You want to consistently be busting your assumptions,” says Verresen. “If you go to neutral — being okay without knowing — you’re much more likely to notice something that escaped your attention before.”\n\nSome people call this Beginner’s Mind , but the concept extends beyond embracing ignorance — it’s the capacity to release judgments and assumptions. In doing so, you create new possibilities without being blinded by limiting beliefs.\n\nFor years, Verresen was one of the in-residence coaches for the most popular class at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business . Called Paths to Power , it emphasizes the importance of neutrality: The world is not fair or unfair. It simply is. The more you can suspend judgment, the more you can learn and grow your power.\n\nWhat do you believe to be absolutely true? Is it still true when you look at it holistically?\n\n“Ask yourself, ‘If I was neutral on this subject, would I notice anything different? If I knew nothing at all about it and just stepped into the situation this moment, what would I see?’” says Verresen. “Neutrality saves you from both blind optimism and safe pessimism. It puts you in proper relationship with what truly is.”\n\nRegularly, she hears from companies that recruiting is impossible. There’s no one out there who’s any good. It’s all hopeless. Then, suddenly, when trained to go to neutral and give up what they think they need in the role or who would be right for it, they realize the right person was in front of them all along. (For the record, she’s seen the same thing happen with San Francisco apartment hunting. Those who have no idea how difficult it is are the ones that tend to find diamond-in-the-rough deals.)\n\nNeutrality also acknowledges that reality is a mess , and one thing is never true for everyone. Companies and teams are made up of many different points of view, contradictions, opinions and voices. The best leader is the one who accepts that they're all true simultaneously — it’s not only their thinking that’s true. This can take many forms. Here’s just one example:\n\n“I tell my clients, if there are multiple opinions on a decision or what to do next in a meeting, write down what each person’s voice is saying in the room,” says Verresen. Maybe 8 people say yes and two people say no to a decision. When you write this down on a whiteboard everyone can see, you’re making it about the ideas, not the people; everyone visually sees the truth of what’s in the room; and the minority opinion gets respected and included.\n\nImportantly, this is not about consensus-based decision-making. It’s more practical than that. When you don’t acknowledge all voices, you always pay for it later. You get people who want to reverse the decision later or slow down the process. “When you go in with eyes wide open, the resistance or negativity you might have felt gets released — neutralized.”\n\n“If your attitude literally dictates the information your eyes are able to see (or what your mind thinks they see), then you have to prime your mental state to see more — it’s just as important as flossing,” says Verresen.\n\nPriming is engaging in any activity that boosts your emotional and mental energy. Sleeping right, eating well and exercising are part of it, of course, but it can be more granular than that too. It can be taking 5 minutes to look at photos that make you happy.\n\n“I coach people who run big companies, and they rely on ‘power boards’ — stacks of photos they’ve grouped on their phones of peak experiences (past victories, ideally), that give them the mental break they need, that shift their energy in the right direction,” she says. “It sounds unlikely or contrived, but you don’t have to believe in magic for it to work sometimes.”\n\nPriming is critical first thing in the morning, but also anytime you feel yourself going into scarcity mode — when your body contracts or your heart starts pounding. When this happens, being able to shift gears fast makes a world of difference for your well-being and creativity. Priming gives you the control to decide which version of yourself you want to be.\n\n“Your body usually knows first what’s happening, so use it like an antenna,” she says. “Then pick the tool that’s going to work in the moment.” Here are the tools she’s seen work best — and she recommends making playlists of this content (i.e. filing it all in the same place on your phone) so you can easily dip in and press play:\n\nHUMOR : Read or watch something you know will make you laugh. ( There’s a proven, scientific connection between humor and creativity at work here .)\n\nMEMORIES : This is where power boards come in handy. Do you have photos of experiences and people you love? It can be a big win — something that seemed impossible that got done. Anything that takes you to a happy place and reminds you what you value on a higher level.\n\nSOUNDTRACKS : Some songs or sounds are bound to have positive associations for you. Play them when you’re down, you’ll feel the change.\n\nMOVEMENT : Get up. Walk anywhere. Staying in one place traps you in the same mindset.\n\nEXTROVERT : Find a thought partner who can offer a different perspective. Get around a group that makes you feel happy and supported.\n\nINTROVERT : Find a quiet conference room to take a break from the noise. Breathe and savor the silence.\n\nThese tools are also useful during the day. “ 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. tend to be when energy drops and these become useful boosts ,” says Verresen. “But any time you feel a little a first pinch of stress or insecurity, you should go into priming. Just go into a conference room or somewhere quiet for five minutes. Use your soundtrack, look at a photo album you’ve made for this purpose. You need distance from whatever you were just doing.”\n\nPriming is a lot like going back to home base during the day to recharge. “Understand that feeling depleted or hopeless isn’t your fault — it’s just wiring — no big deal,” she says. “Get off your own case and focus on doing the next constructive thing.”\n\nResilience is the ability to self-soothe — a process that has three steps or phases. Verresen uses this framework based on Psychology Professor Kristin Neff ’s work at UT Austin:\n\nFirst, admit that an experience or situation is painful , that you’re suffering, you’re struggling. Maybe you’re burnt out, things aren't going the way you want, or you just received some bad news. Feel the discomfort in the moment, and don’t try to hide from it or dismiss it. According to Neff, simply labeling an emotion starts to calm you down.\n\nSecond, acknowledge that this type of pain is a shared human experience. Life is full of terrible, trying, maddening, sorrowful situations. It happens to the best of us, and none of us are alone. All founders experience pain when fundraising. “There are no new stressful thoughts. Someone else has experienced what you’re feeling before or is going through it right now,” says Verresen. “When we’re in pain we isolate. We need to reconnect to start recovery.”\n\nThird, figure out what kind, mindful action you could take to feel better right now. What can you give yourself to get even just a little relief? Maybe it’s getting out of the room, or choosing to sleep or exercise over work, or admitting you don’t know the answer. Play with your pet. Soulcycle. Do something kind for yourself — that means nourishing, grounding, something that makes you feel concretely better after you do it. Neff says even putting your hand over your heart of a minute can get oxytocin flowing to provide emotional relief.\n\nStudies have shown that self-compassion is correlated with much greater grit . For instance, researchers monitored veterans returning from Afghanistan , and it turned out their incidence of PTSD was not correlated with the duration or severity of their combat, but with their individual levels of self-compassion.\n\nQuickly running through these three steps is one way to maintain an abundant mindset in the most stressful or emotional situations. Everyone is bound to run into scarcity. Verresen recommends taking several self-compassion breaks during the day. It takes less than 3 minutes and gives you a tremendous amount of emotional flexibility and resilience. This is especially vital if you’re in full lock-down mode, in the trenches, battling it out, sprinting, and need to maximize alignment with your team.\n\nKnow your personal currency. Research shows that the most powerful and happy people are at the center of large networks constantly giving to their connections . This is how you grow a tribe — by being generous with your currency, whether it’s valuable introductions, technical skill, editing abilities, being a good listener etc.\n\nToo many people feel like they have nothing to offer when they have a ton: attention, presence, kindness, knowledge, access to resources.\n\nAlong the same lines, she recommends forming \" giving circles \" of friends and co-workers who can do the same thing for each other — just 5 to 7 people where everyone is working on something unrelated. They can come to the circle to have other people give them ideas for how to solve problems, and point out unseen opportunities they might have.\n\n“Other people’s mind maps help you get unstuck,” she says. “Remember, the people you know the least generally have the most power to introduce you to something new or change your mind.”\n\nEach person should present what it is they want help with, and then set a timer for 7 minutes, during which the other participants brainstorm solutions. Make a Post-It note for each of these ideas and put them on the wall. This will keep momentum high and yield concrete results. The only requirements: Generosity, and understanding that there are no bad ideas. Whenever Verresen has run these circles, members have reported feeling energized for days afterward.\n\nWhen you build a tribe of people you support, you're building a tribe that will support you.\n\nYou should always seek fresh perspectives outside the groupthink of your immediate workplace. Who out there can shed light on your blind spots and assumptions? Identify people in your life who want to develop the same skill set, but who are at a different company or in a different industry. Those are the people who can best flag possibilities for you.\n\nThis will also help you find mentors, which is critical . Verresen strongly suggests creating your own personal advisory board of mentors, including experts outside of your field. They open up green fields and blue skies because they’re not mired in the same culture as you. “What seems like a roller coaster to you is often a straight line to someone who's been there before,” Verresen says. “I often tell clients, ‘ You can borrow my certainty if you want ,’ because I’ve seen how companies like them get the funding, or win in the long-run, and I know it will happen for them too no matter how scared they are. You want mentors who will give you this type of certainty. ”\n\nEarly in her career, one of her advisors was Larry Mohr , co-founder of Mohr Davidow Ventures . During the 2000 dot-com blowup, he would say to her, “Forest fires are normal and good. Panicking isn’t going to help. Just keep your eyes open, because after forest fires, there’s always a wave of seedlings.” And he was right, a whole crop of new companies — Twitter and Facebook among them — marked the birth of the new social media era. She got to borrow his certainty to weather a rough patch.\n\nOne often overlooked form of generosity is appreciation. It sounds so simple, but it has an outsized impact on the people around you. “I’ve seen so many people’s performance change in a snap because their boss told them, ‘Good job,’” she says. “In this culture, everyone is bearing so much weight and responsibility, they’re not even appreciating themselves.”\n\nThe abundant mindset sees opportunities to appreciate others, and the result is more abundance. The best form of appreciation is precise. It recognizes something specific and the impact it made. The effect this can have on a company is astounding.\n\nFor appreciation to be effective, it needs to be observable and specific. (This means not pulling people aside to say, “you’re awesome.” It means speaking up in a very grounded and tangible way to reinforce high performance for a team or individual.) Studies have shown that the highest-functioning teams abide by the law that people do their best when they receive 7 positive pieces of feedback for every one constructive criticism .\n\n“When you look at healthy teams, unbridled, uninhibited appreciation is always a key ingredient,” says Verresen. “It’s the No. 1 retention tool in the world.”\n\nGratitude is the muscle that makes miracles happen.\n\nAccording to Verresen, looking at your world through a lens of gratitude reveals what might be hidden right in front of you. Myriad studies have shown that consistently and proactively (even hyper-consciously) practicing gratitude can rewire the brain and have lasting side-effects.\n\nBut what does practicing this actually mean?\n\nTake 5 minutes a day to focus on only the good things that are happening right now. Actually schedule this time on your calendar and commit to not missing it no matter what else is going on. You can use gratitude to prime yourself when you feel your energy running low. It refreshes the brain.\n\n“So many people overlook their success and things they’ve created in their careers,” says Verresen. “You have to express gratitude for your own creations to really acknowledge that they happened and get that value and leverage the momentum forward for what you're creating next.”\n\nOne of her clients recently celebrated their company’s 10-year anniversary. So, she made each of the founders a list of the major milestones they accomplished. When she shared them, the room was euphoric. Then she told each of them to take just a moment to envision the 2005 versions of themselves who would have never believed this reality was possible. This is a vital step.\n\n“ By reminding yourself that you have literally achieved the impossible, you are that much more likely to believe in your abilities and stretch your goals going forward ,” she says. “If this thing was doable, just think of what you’re capable of now. Capture that momentum to accelerate future big thinking and growth.”\n\nThe human brain operates in feedback loops. So it’s essential that we regularly feed them the right diet. Too often, driven people move onto the next challenge before they fully experience their most recent win. When you do this, you rob yourself and your team of the velocity you would get from acknowledging goals that have been met.\n\nThis also reinforces the point that abundant thinking shouldn’t wait. It’s a part of the process of getting to your goal. “There’s this pervasive feeling people have that says, ‘Once I get that funding, it will be okay.’ Or ‘Once we hire that person, it will be okay.’ And on and on. But that’s just living in scarcity and nothing will ever be enough,” says Verresen. “When you take time to be grateful for what you do have going for you, you’re training your brain to shift away from stress, to not overreact, and to be open to alternative routes forward.”\n\nOnce a client asked her why this was so important. He thought the pressure was working in his favor. Her response:\n\nBecause you’ll suffer fucking less. When you’re suffering, you’re not at your best.\n\nShe often sees leaders in scarcity mode come out of meetings beaten down, upset about something that was said or a disagreement. And they’ll totally miss the fact that they were allocated resources, or that there was consensus on another point that mattered to them.\n\n“They literally delete information that someone in the same meeting would have taken to mean, ‘Fuck yeah, they just gave me engineering resources to get this done!’ If you make a point of being thankful for everything given to you, you won’t miss the small gifts and opportunities,” she says.\n\nYou can build gratitude into your life through regular rituals. Verresen recommends daily, weekly and monthly reflections that emphasize what went right, what you’ve created that you’re proud of, and what you’re thankful for. All it takes is writing it down in a journal (whether that’s pen and paper, on Evernote, or whatever).\n\nDo it at the end of every day. Do it on Sunday evenings for the entire week, picking out the most important things. Do it again the last day of every month. Do it until you have a distilled list of three things that really moved the needle or mattered for you.\n\nAs you write more down, you’ll increase your energy. You’ll start to see achievements stack up to reach goals that seemed insurmountable. You’ll power up your confidence and go forth with greater vision for what you can do in the next day, week and month. And, to make an even bigger impact, do what Verresen does, and advises all her clients to do:\n\nShe writes down what she’s grateful for in her own life.\n\nShe writes down what she’s grateful for that other people did.\n\nShe immediately sends those people an email or calls them out at a meeting.\n\nShe’s seen this habit completely transform company culture. And it takes mere minutes at the end of the day.\n\nConsistency builds trust and speed. When you do something consistently, you work in the interest of the long-term. You resist being reactive.\n\nDoing something that moves you toward your goals every day gives you built-in resilience. That way, when there is a fire, and someone runs into the room shouting that everyone needs to stop what they’re doing to solve THIS problem NOW, you won’t lose sight of and momentum toward your ultimate mission. You’re building the underlying structure that keeps your team nimble and on track.\n\nEvery leader wants to think of themselves as being strong, open, and inspiring — not the kind of person who plays into zero-sum criticism, command and control management, or thinks they’re the smartest voice in the room. But the only way to ensure you’re not this type of leader is to consciously practice these habits and attributes every day.\n\n“ In every moment and interaction, you have the freedom to choose what you want to be like ,” she says. “A really good leader is the one who knows that — that no situation or reality is forcing them to act a certain way. This gives them that freedom.”\n\nWhen you make a point of thinking abundantly — noticing more, integrating more, and sharing more of what you know — everyone on your team will know what direction you’re heading. They’ll follow your model and include more information and opinions in their decision-making. They won’t rush to judgment, or panic about having the wrong answer.\n\nWhen you’re building something new, you’ll inevitably run into 11th hour, all-hands-on-deck, crunch-mode situations — all the time. When you lead teams, you’re never out of the woods. In these cases, it’s so easy to tell your team, “Keep cranking, we’ll breathe when we’re done!” It’s easy to let all the habits enumerated above fall by the wayside because you believe you have no time or room.\n\nBut this is exactly when they’re needed the most. Every tool mentioned here takes less than 5 minutes to perform, enabling you to be at your best — which is also the way to ensure your team is at its best. At the times that matter most, you can't accept less. That’s not going to happen if you’re pushing through exhaustion.\n\n“These are the moments that should remind you why you got into this in the first place. Every big launch or event or crisis or fire — this is your jam. This is when you want all cylinders firing and to double down on the practices that keep you at peak performance,” says Verresen. “There’s absolutely no mojo in saying, ‘we just need to get through this.’ Remember why this work makes you feel alive and go from there.”\n\nRetired poker player and decision-making expert shares advice for facing down uncertainty and making better decisions.\n\n23

\u003e\u003e Blog \u003e\u003e Reflections: The ecosystem is moving","link":"https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving","content":"At Open Whisper Systems, we’ve been developing open source “consumer-facing” software for the past four years. We want to share some of the things we’ve learned while doing it.\n\nAs a software developer, I envy writers, musicians, and filmmakers. Unlike software, when they create something, it is really done — forever. A recorded album can be just the same 20 years later, but software has to change.\n\nSoftware exists as part of an ecosystem, and the ecosystem is moving . The platform changes out from under it, the networks evolve, security threats and countermeasures are in constant shift, and the collective UX language rarely sits still. As more money, time, and focus has gone into the ecosystem, the faster the whole thing has begun to travel.\n\nAll of this means that the set of expectations users have for social and communication features are evolving rapidly. Anyone building software today knows that it is not possible to stand still.\n\nOne of the controversial things we did with Signal early on was to build it as an unfederated service. Nothing about any of the protocols we’ve developed requires centralization; it’s entirely possible to build a federated Signal Protocol-based messenger, but I no longer believe that it is possible to build a competitive federated messenger at all.\n\nIn some circles, this has not been a popular opinion. When someone recently asked me about federating an unrelated communication platform into the Signal network, I told them that I thought we’d be unlikely to ever federate with clients and servers we don’t control. Their retort was “that’s dumb, how far would the internet have gotten without interoperable protocols defined by 3rd parties?”\n\nI thought about it. We got to the first production version of IP, and have been trying for the past 20 years to switch to a second production version of IP with limited success. We got to HTTP version 1.1 in 1997, and have been stuck there until now. Likewise, SMTP, IRC, DNS, XMPP, are all similarly frozen in time circa the late 1990s. To answer his question, that’s how far the internet got. It got to the late 90s.\n\nThat has taken us pretty far, but it’s undeniable that once you federate your protocol, it becomes very difficult to make changes. And right now, at the application level, things that stand still don’t fare very well in a world where the ecosystem is moving .\n\nIndeed, cannibalizing a federated application-layer protocol into a centralized service is almost a sure recipe for a successful consumer product today. It’s what Slack did with IRC, what Facebook did with email, and what WhatsApp has done with XMPP. In each case, the federated service is stuck in time, while the centralized service is able to iterate into the modern world and beyond.\n\nSo while it’s nice that I’m able to host my own email, that’s also the reason why my email isn’t end-to-end encrypted, and probably never will be. By contrast, WhatsApp was able to introduce end-to-end encryption to over a billion users with a single software update. So long as federation means stasis while centralization means movement, federated protocols are going to have trouble existing in a software climate that demands movement as it does today.\n\nEarly on, I thought we’d federate Signal once its velocity had subsided. Now I realize that things will probably never slow down, and if anything the velocity of the entire landscape seems to be steadily increasing.\n\nXMPP is an example of a federated protocol that advertises itself as a “living standard.” Despite its capacity for protocol “extensions,” however, it’s undeniable that XMPP still largely resembles a synchronous protocol with limited support for rich media, which can’t realistically be deployed on mobile devices. If XMPP is so extensible, why haven’t those extensions quickly brought it up to speed with the modern world?\n\nLike any federated protocol, extensions don’t mean much unless everyone applies them, and that’s an almost impossible task in a truly federated landscape. What we have instead is a complicated morass of XEPs that aren’t consistently applied anywhere. The implications of that are severe, because someone’s choice to use an XMPP client or server that doesn’t support video or some other arbitrary feature doesn’t only affect them, it affects everyone who tries to communicate with them. It creates a climate of uncertainty, never knowing whether things will work or not. In the consumer space, fractured client support is often worse than no client support at all, because consistency is incredibly important for creating a compelling user experience.\n\nFor example, even GitHub has problems with consistency and control right now. They introduced issue templates , but a number of third-party GitHub clients don’t support them, so even after creating a thorough issue template for the Signal Android repository, we still get people who post “it doesn’t work please help,” because their client never even showed them the template. That makes me annoyed with GitHub, even though I use the official GitHub clients. It’s a potential opportunity for a GitHub competitor that can display issue templates consistently.\n\nOne potential benefit of federation is the ability to choose what provider gets access to your metadata. However, as someone who self-hosts my email, that has never felt particularly relevant, given that every email I send or receive seems to have Gmail on the other end of it anyway. Federated services always seem to coalesce around a provider that the bulk of people use, with a long tail of small scattered self-hosting across the internet. That makes sense, because running a reliable service isn’t easy, but it’s an outcome that is sadly the worst of both worlds.\n\nIf anything, protecting metadata is going to require innovation in new protocols and software. Those changes are only likely to be possible in centralized environments with more control, rather than less. Just as making the changes to consistently deploy end-to-end encryption in federated protocols like email has proved difficult, we’re more likely to see the emergence of enhanced metadata protection in centralized environments with greater control.\n\nOn some level, federation is appealing precisely because it does freeze protocols in time. It’s great when centralized clients and servers roll out features that benefit us, but they could just as easily roll out features that don’t. Federation gives us more collective control over what changes we accept, but that comes with an unacceptable inability to adapt.\n\nGiven that federated services always seem to coalesce around a provider that the bulk of people use, federation becomes a sort of implicit threat. Nobody really wants to run their own servers, but they know that it might be possible if their current host does something egregious enough to make it worth the effort.\n\nHowever, over the past six years, we’ve also seen the user cost of switching between centralized communication services reduced substantially, particularly given the tendency towards addressing with user-owned identifiers like phone numbers. The device’s address book is now the social network , so using phone numbers as an identifier has reduced switching costs by putting a user’s social network under their control. In a way, the notification center on a mobile device has become the federation point for all communication apps, similar to how older desktop IM clients unified communication across multiple IM networks.\n\nThe effect has been visible in the messaging space, where market leaders have come and gone, new popular apps come out of nowhere, and even the most successful players seem compelled to continue iterating and improving their services as quickly as possible.\n\nThis reduced user friction has begun to extend the implicit threat that used to come with federated services into centralized services as well. Where as before you could switch hosts, or even decide to run your own server, now users are simply switching entire networks. In many cases that cost is now much lower than the federated switching cost of changing your email address to use a different email provider.\n\nAn open source infrastructure for a centralized network now provides almost the same level of control as federated protocols, without giving up the ability to adapt. If a centralized provider with an open source infrastructure ever makes horrible changes, those that disagree have the software they need to run their own alternative instead.

70% new material, including longer video-like definitions, otherworldly illustrations, and some thoughts on language and the meaning of life.\n\nPre-order your copy here (click links on the right): https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Dictionary-of-Obscure-Sorrows/John-Koenig/9781501153648\n\nJohn Koenig is a video maker, graphic designer, and voiceover artist from Minnesota, who lives in Minneapolis with his wife and daughter. His work has been acclaimed by New York Magazine, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, and the guys from Radiolab.\n\nFeel free to write me directly and describe an emotion you need a word for:\n\nI never imagined this was possible, but “The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” is now a New York Times bestseller! There are no words for how grateful I feel, knowing that I’m not alone. If you’re thinking of gifts for anyone you know who’s creative, thoughtful, or going through confusing times, you might want to order them a copy now: https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1501153641?tag=simonsayscom\n\nn . curiosity about the impact you’ve had on the lives of the people you know, wondering which of your harmless actions or long-forgotten words might have altered the plot of their stories in ways you’ll never get to see.\n\n“The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” is available in hardcover, with hundreds of new definitions: https://bit.ly/3z1RYvH\n\nAnonymous asked:\n\nCONGRATS for the publication of the book !! I'm so glad this is finally happening ! I just have one question : how is are the contents organized ? Is it like a normal dictionary with entries in alphabetical order, or in order of creation like this tumblr, or something else entirely ?\n\nGood question! The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows is divided into six chapters, with definitions grouped according to theme:\n\n1. Between Living and Dreaming (about worldview and desire) 2. The Interior Wilderness (selfhood and identity) 3. Montage of Attractions (relationships and intimacy) 4. Faces in a Crowd (society and alienation) 5. Boats Against the Current (time and memory) 6. Roll the Bones (uncertainty and chaos)\n\nThere’s also a postscript section called “After Words,” with some commentary on language and meaning, and what this project has meant to me personally.\n\nThe definitions are arranged in no particular order, with an emphasis on variety and unpredictability. Which feels fairly true to life, given the way your moods tend to drift through your mind like the weather.\n\nThis project started here on Tumblr more than 10 years ago. To all my followers, I can’t thank you all enough for sticking with me through all these years. Because of your support, I’m proud to announce the book is finally here.\n\nAs of TODAY, “The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” is now available at Amazon, Barnes \u0026 Noble, and your local bookstore. It’s a dictionary of made-up words for emotions that we all feel but don’t have the words to express, filled with new definitions, illustrations, etymologies and essays that seek to capture the forgotten corners of the human condition.\n\nGet your copy from Simon \u0026 Schuster: https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Dictionary-of-Obscure-Sorrows/John-Koenig/9781501153648?utm_source=author_post\u0026utm_medium=author_social\u0026utm_campaign=the_dictionary_of_obscure_sorrows\u0026utm_content= (click any of the links on the right)\n\nn . the feeling of emptiness after a long and arduous process is finally complete—having finished school, recovered from surgery, or gone home at the end of your wedding—which leaves you relieved that it’s over but missing the stress that organized your life into a mission.\n\nPre-order your copy of “The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” from Simon \u0026 Schuster: https://bit.ly/3z1RYvH\n\nPRE-ORDER your copy of “The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” here, from Simon \u0026 Schuster: https://bit.ly/3z1RYvH (click on any of the links on the right) I think about this feeling a lot. Driving past your childhood home to show it to a friend, or pointing at a picture of a loved one you lost, only to realize that to them it’s just another house, just another face. Etymology: Aulasy is a contraction of auld lang syne , which is Scots for “times long past”—fragments of which are still present in aulasy , but the meaning has been lost.\n\nPre-order your copy of “The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” from Simon \u0026 Schuster: https://bit.ly/3z1RYvH\n\n“Of course, you’d like to think you’ve got a clear view of the broader social landscape—but it’s possible you don’t have a clue. There are so many backstories that people keep to themselves, so many side conversations you don’t even know exist. Some of your friends are vastly different people when they’re one-on-one with each other, such that both would seem unrecognizable. Even now an unexpected pair of them might be helping each other through a crisis, or carrying on a silent feud, or having a fling that you won’t hear about until years later. But even if everything was open and honest, you’d still have to confront the ever-shifting labyrinth of interconnected relationships and personas and levels of intimacy you could scarcely even begin to fathom.”\n\nC O N T I N U E","tokenFrequency":{"grate":1,"section":1,"direct":1,"fill":1,"preorder":4,"need":1,"entir":1,"post":2,"view":1,"level":1,"uncertainti":1,"clue":1,"sorrows”":6,"i'm":2,"free":1,"minnesota":1,"“time":1,"present":1,"go":1,"stori":1,"live":3,"curios":1,"you'v":2,"unpredict":1,"want":1,"exist":1,"start":1,"condit":1,"year":4,"creation":1,"daughter":1,"arrang":1,"harmless":1,"simon":4,"“after":1,"dictionari":9,"good":1,"hous":1,"friend":2,"carri":1,"who":1,"crowd":1,"accord":1,"congrat":1,"love":1,"support":1,"way":2,"confus":1,"maker":1,"vast":1,"don't":3,"fling":1,"finish":1,"you'll":1,"memori":1,"acclaim":1,"divid":1,"huffington":1,"even":4,"interior":1,"10":1,"crisi":1,"feel":6,"desir":1,"author":1,"mood":1,"httpswwwsimonandschustercombooksthedictionaryofobscuresorrowsjohnkoenig9781501153648":1,"click":3,"etymolog":2,"someth":1,"avail":2,"oneonon":1,"—":1,"backstori":1,"gone":1,"evershift":1,"bestsel":1,"call":1,"feud":1,"describ":1,"httpsbitly3z1ryvh":4,"thank":1,"obscur":7,"lot":1,"illustr":2,"corner":1,"roll":1,"schuster":4,"languag":2,"wonder":1,"otherworld":1,"empti":1,"creativ":1,"everyth":1,"current":1,"hardcov":1,"300":1,"httpswwwsimonandschustercombooksthedictionaryofobscuresorrowsjohnkoenig9781501153648utmsource=authorpost\u0026utmmedium=authorsocial\u0026utmcampaign=thedictionaryofobscuresorrows\u0026utmcontent=":1,"lost":2,"group":1,"normal":1,"emot":2,"john":2,"mean":3,"anyon":1,"action":1,"honest":1,"later":1,"given":1,"“the":6,"lang":1,"interconnect":1,"surgeri":1,"there":1,"star":1,"proud":1,"person":1,"definit":5,"dream":1,"worldview":1,"guy":1,"meant":1,"wilder":1,"design":1,"miss":1,"happen":1,"alphabet":1,"never":2,"point":1,"wife":1,"pictur":1,"won't":1,"time":3,"clear":1,"hear":1,"face":2,"tumblr":2,"write":1,"plot":1,"alter":1,"complete—hav":1,"societi":1,"mind":1,"seek":1,"emphasi":1,"particular":1,"essay":1,"alon":1,"pair":1,"els":1,"possibl":2,"organ":2,"see":1,"seem":1,"12":1,"unrecogniz":1,"impact":1,"glad":1,"true":1,"auld":1,"labyrinth":1,"includ":1,"video":1,"arduous":1,"would":1,"begin":1,"social":1,"show":1,"ident":1,"hundr":1,"varieti":1,"also":1,"ask":1,"words”":1,"barn":1,"one":2,"follow":1,"magazin":1,"voiceov":1,"aulasi":2,"past”—frag":1,"project":2,"realiz":1,"today":1,"syne":1,"stress":1,"anoth":2,"right":3,"drive":1,"green":1,"still":2,"longer":1,"got":1,"stick":1,"persona":1,"graphic":1,"wedding—which":1,"confront":1,"commentari":1,"silent":1,"amazon":1,"intimaci":2,"it":4,"content":1,"like":4,"broader":1,"copi":6,"tend":1,"anonym":1,"recov":1,"“of":1,"selfhood":1,"express":1,"differ":1,"minneapoli":1,"theme":1,"thought":2,"get":2,"bone":1,"fathom”":1,"contract":1,"70":1,"scot":1,"help":1,"scarc":1,"landscape—but":1,"open":1,"public":1,"imagin":1,"announc":1,"entri":1,"you'r":1,"postscript":1,"chao":1,"gift":1,"nobl":1,"new":5,"videolik":1,"can't":1,"materi":1,"life":3,"final":4,"school":1,"'s":1,"radiolab":1,"know":4,"mani":2,"weather":1,"mission":1,"could":1,"montag":1,"bookstor":1,"childhood":1,"keep":1,"koenig":1,"alien":1,"leav":1,"long":2,"process":1,"madeup":1,"forgotten":1,"you'd":2,"might":3,"make":1,"convers":1,"think":3,"unexpect":1,"page":1,"work":1,"httpswwwamazoncomexecobidosasin1501153641tag=simonsayscom":1,"relationship":2,"fair":1,"ago":1,"book":2,"human":1,"enough":1,"boat":1,"link":3,"captur":1,"peopl":3,"attract":1,"question":2,"fault":1,"":31,"six":1,"they'r":1,"longforgotten":1,"york":2,"artist":1,"drift":1,"reliev":1,"'m":1,"washington":1,"home":2,"cours":1,"local":1,"past":1,"order":4,"end":1,"sorrow":1,"chapter":1,"word":5,"side":1}}}
